26543,"I finally went through the depths of cinephilia hell. The pinnacle of intellectual masturbation. I get the appeal (a feast for film snobs to project their sense of grandeur) and I understand how hard it must be to give this slog of a film less than 5 stars after torturing yourself for 7 hours only to signal a superior taste, but it's far too pretentious, overindulgent, insufferable, dull and soulless for my sensibilities, something I can put up with to an extent, but not to this level or length. Despite the intentionality of it all, Satantango is just the EXTREME opposite of everything that I love and resonate with in cinema, or on any level of my being, and I just can't help but see it as  an arthouse parody or as a hilarious bait for the most excruciatingly snobbish and pedantic cinephiles out there. Anyway, I'm just glad that this chore is over and done. I'll never put myself through something like this again. Time is too precious, and the way this movie works around it is the proof.",1,satantango
73448,"Of all the movies I haven’t seen, this is the one people have scoffed the most about throughout my life.As someone who fundamentally disagrees with the idea of war insofar as that I don’t believe innocent people should be pitted against each other to fight the political battles of their oppressors, any film that operates with the slightest tinge of unironic nationalism is guaranteed to leave a bad taste in my mouth. Even World War 2 (which is perhaps the most “agreeable war”) still saw millions of people forced to kill and be killed for the landmass they happened to be born on.With this said, of course this movie showcases the horrors of war like any worthwhile war film, but it fails to completely deconstruct and denounce warfare in a way that sits wrong with me. There are moments that almost go there, like the soldier who refuses to fight or the glimpses of humanity from the German soldiers, but the movie still ends with a feeling of “this was all worth it”. Schindler’s List is a much better WW2 film from Spielberg that doesn’t dip its toes into unsettling Hollywood propaganda.However, two great action scenes bookending the film prove, yes, Spielberg can make a movie, but two great action scenes do not make a great movie.I’m glad I’ve finally seen it so people can quit they scoffin’!",3,saving-private-ryan
35210,"Calling this 'bleak' or 'nihilistic' is more than it deserves. It's a dull, middlebrow film that thinks it's Béla Tarr. Where is the cinematography that everyone is praising? Every scene is nearly identical: One character is in focus while another is blurry. They have a conversation while staring into the distance. Everyone speaks exactly the same, with the same length of pauses between every line of dialogue. Ad nauseam.

Becker knows that watching the toil of these prisoners in vignettes of real-time will illustrate the stakes in ways that no convoluted, cheaply manipulative contemporary blockbuster could ever hope to. We understand them intimately, because we feel them ourselves. I love it.Le Trou is a masterpiece. I don't use the word lightly, nor do I toss about five-star reviews willy-nilly, but this bad boy is getting one. The film is beautiful to look at, rippling with tension, and effective on every facet. It's confident enough to know that it needs no score but the banging of metal, the crashing of concrete, the scrabbling of rock. Every once in a while, you simply fall in love with a movie. Chasing that feeling is the cinephile's addiction and, when you find it, it's glorious. I can't recommend this one enough.

68308,"Film #1 that was recommended to me,feel free to add to the list :D Recommended by: Sam , Mas  and  Cinemanick Raging bull is a film I was more than hyped to see as it is starring the legends that are Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci and is directed by one of my all time favorite directors Martin Scorsese.First off hats off to De Niro for getting in shape for this film.It's insane what he went through and how much weight he gained only for a couple of scenes.You only need to watch this masterpiece to realize why so many people have named him ""The greatest actor ever"".He is in my top 3 along with Nicholson and Jimmy stewartComing off to the direction,this is the most brutal film I've seen from Scorsese even surpassing the likes of taxi driver in my opinion.The choreography is off the limits and you truly feel every punch.This was basically Scorsese reacting to losing to ""Rocky"" and being like:""You want a boxing film academy?Here is a boxing film,a REAL boxing film about a REAL boxer,not fairy tales.Robert get ready you are playing a boxer.""And they still didn't give him Best picture!!??Holywood was never kind to him sadly no wonder he is siding with Netflix now..Joe Pesci always brings something unique to the table that no other actor can bring.He is a true joy to watch and a phenomenal actor.He must have killed it at school plays.LaMotta is portrayed as an awful yet intimidating person.He critisizes the mafia's ways and doesn't really accept violence even though he is as violent as they come.He is always ultra-protective of his wife and extremely jealous of every man around him-even his own brother-yet in he club he makes out with all the ladies.My point is that he critizes others while he never has self-critisizm.Heck he doesn't even realize the error of his ways until the end of the movie!!And even then he doesn't put the blame to himself...Overall Raging Bull is one of Scorsese's finest films out of the 7 films of his that I've seen meaning that it is one of the greatest films of all time for me.And up there with ""The  Shining"" for greatest 80s film.It features insanely great performances from the entire cast as well as a great screenplay.The direction comes from Scorsese so it is as good as you would expect.Extremely recommended of course!!Big thanks to @Sam Stevenson,@Mas and @Cinemanick for recommending me this masterpiece.Added to  You Pick I Watch RANKED",9,raging-bull

48041,"The ultimate food porn movie… sometimes maybe a little too literally. What a damn good movie. Tampopo doesn’t let itself be defined by a single genre. It’s at once a western, a family drama, a romance, an action film and an adventure. It’s hilarious, exciting, engrossing, romantic, erotic and delightfully wholesome. Endlessly creative in its structure and writing and sometimes even masterful in its directing. The central storyline is so much fun to watch, and the vignettes that show up in the film are so well integrated into the narrative that they all feel like irreplaceable pieces of the film. They’re not only hilarious, but it adds both to the world of the film and to its comedy - sometimes even its drama. From the very first scene it’s made clear that what we are watching is a film - even within its own universe with the Gangster in the White Suit (brilliantly portrayed by the legend Koji Yakusho) - and yet still there’s not a single moment where my suspension of disbelief was ever interrupted. I was totally immersed in this familiar yet fresh narrative, including all the familiar cliches of the genre but still remaining remarkably original.If you don’t like this film chances are you’re probably missing a soul.",8,tampopo

39668,"Self-indulgent and self-assured, All That Jazz is a self-portrait by Bob Fosse, in which he is portrayed as Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider). Split between a comedy film he is editing and a Broadway musical he is beginning to choreograph and cast, Gideon is confronted by the Angel of Death (Jessica Lange) and by his hard living life filled with drugs, booze, smoking, and women. With Joe having heart issues and being forced to face his own mortality, his life comes back to haunt him. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse's direction of his own tale is far too self-indulgent, obvious, and unenjoyable. As Joe's health declines, the film feels more like self-deprecation and a man feeling remorse only because of his circumstances. He is a character that is impossible to like and one that we cannot root for, in large part because of Fosse's own negative characterization of himself. Directed by this self-hatred, All That Jazz just feels like a therapist sob session in movie form.My biggest problem with the film is the last hour to half hour or so for a variety of reasons. One, the constant overlaying of the sequence from his comedy film that he was editing earlier in the film. Films that do not trust their audience to put things together on their own are the scourge of cinema. I hate being treated like a moron and this film feels like Fosse is looking at me forlornly and says, ""I am sorry, but you just do not get it."" Thus, this monologue sequence in which a standup comedian describes the five stages of death is played every five minutes - not an exaggeration - for the last hour or so. Joe gets sick and battles with death. This is clear as he hallucinates on a hospital bed and has open heart surgery. We know things are not going well for him and that he is near death. Yet, the film needs to keep reminding us that he is going through the five stages of death. We are unable to put it together ourselves or remember earlier in the film at all. Doing it once, is maybe understandable. Just to refresh us and alert us that this is set to be important. Otherwise, we may write it off. That is fine. However, Fosse overdoes it significantly and beats the viewer over the head with this quote to the point that I wanted to punch the comedian in the face and shut off the film. I did not need to see it 1,000 times to get the point that Joe is going through the stages of death.Second, the final musical number. While the music is good throughout, this sequence really underscores why this film is self-indulgent. For Joe Gideon, he is the center of his own world. Nobody else matters and he acts in his own self-interest throughout. As mentioned, this feels like Fosse feeling sorry for himself throughout the film, which is equally as aggravating. That aside, this musical number goes on for way too long and is far too over the top. People selfishly expect the world to change with their death. But, no, things will keep going on. By making such an extravagant ending that goes on for as long as it does, Fosse seems to be making a celebration of his own demise and forgiving himself for his own sins on behalf of those he wronged. This celebration for himself at the time of his death is Fosse at his most self-indulgent in this film and highlights his unwillingness to share the spotlight. Not only are other characters marginalized, but he even has a conversation with himself on his death bed. A prime chance to recognize his own faults, he instead plays into them and expects to just put on a show for everybody else regardless.Fosse, in his spate of self-indulgence, further spirals out of control during the insurance negotiations and open heart surgery sequence, in which he cross cuts between the two. Joe Gideon is the focus of the show and always has been. After this, a fan sees fellow director Lucas Sergeant (John Lithgow) and declares that he is her second favorite director after Gideon. Fosse cannot stop kissing his own character's ass for the life of him. He is a bad man who cheats on his wife, yet he makes excuses for this behavior and questions why fidelity is a good thing. He refuses to admit he leads women on and uses them for their bodies. He may be a great choreographer and director, but he is a remorseless asshole. Even his own mortality cannot stop his own selfishness and self-love. Joe is the kind of guy that sleeps with women and tosses them away because he cannot sleep with himself and keeps seeking somebody who is just as good as he thinks as he is. Unfortunately, nobody can top his own perception of himself. In the director's chair, Fosse depicts this asshole and feels sorry for himself and he tries to create sympathy for this loser as we watch the world kiss his feet and Joe sip his own kool-aid. Fosse is physically incapable of criticizing himself and the film suffers mightily for it, hence why it feels like an expensive pity party. Fosse begs you to sympathize for Joe Gideon because he cannot rationalize his actions either. To sympathize with Joe is to let him off the hook and I refuse to do so. Fosse is apparently beginning to feel remorse and is begging for forgiveness by seeming to portray his character negatively, but he always follow up a negative moment with a scene that is self-affirmative and defensive.All That Jazz does have a couple redeeming qualities though. It has great music and Roy Scheider is phenomenal. The cinematography and choreography are also all top-notch, even if the sex-filled number is annoying and tedious. There are many scenes that go on for too long in the second half, but the first half is littered with scenes that I wish could go on forever. Here, Joe Gideon is bearable and a great dancing instructor. You can see how hard working he is and how passionate of a man he can be. Unfortunately, he has his shortcomings and these come to pass in the second half with nary any critique of these actions. That said, the music and the acting is really what saves this one and sells it as being anything but a self-indulgent vanity picture. Sadly, this is not enough to help it overcome its litany of faults.Self-indulgent, vain, and unapologetic, All That Jazz seems to be Bob Fosse's way of showing he is not all that bad, in spite of his personal faults. He refuses to own these faults and instead beats you over the head with his supposed brilliance. Worse, he does not trust us to understand he is dying in this film and the stages of death discussed in the film, so he beats you over the head with it repeatedly until you, the moronic viewer, can actually begin to comprehend what he is doing. Because, ya know, he is just so damn brilliant and talented. All That Jazz is ultimately insipid, self-assured, and annoyingly self-reflexive. It is a film with style, visual flair, and musical brilliance, but it lacks a soul and suffers from cinematic angina that causes it to have a massive heart attack when it realizes it may not be as brilliant as previously assumed.",3,all-that-jazz
24525,"On one hand I have been enjoying all the splendor that Miyazaki has conjured up on the screen with this film. It all looks fantastic. Beautiful action scenes, strong soundtrack and in one way or another Miyazaki always draws you into his world. That is why I also had few problems with its runtime.On the other hand: the story is very moralistic, but also messy, overloaded and busy. It mainly seems as if the makers were limping on about six thoughts. Are we making a fairytale? Or a serious drama about social conflict? Maybe an eco film? Or do we prefer mysticism and spirituality as a theme? As a result, this film is none of them. The plot still starts well, but new plot elements are added that replace the old ones, so that a clear structure is no longer possible. The characters remain flat, and it even seems that people did not dare to choose here either; everyone actually has the best of intentions and the conflict is purely based on misunderstandings. The ending makes it undeniably (too) sweet, but too late to save it. Miyazaki has made better ones in my opinion.",4,princess-mononoke

43600,"Everything about King Vidor’s War and Peace adaptation is absolutely pathetic. It reduces a novel that addresses the entire spectrum of human emotion, makes broad points about the changing of Russian society, and explores the philosophy of what causes wars to a poorly written, badly acted, sappy wartime romance.The dialogue has no wit or complexity whatsoever. The writing both simplifies and misunderstands the source material. Furthermore, aside from the hideous miscasting of almost everyone and the unfortunate mixing of British and American accents, there seems to be no direction given as to how the actors should say lines. Clearly nobody had any creative ideas about how dialogue should be spoken or how scenes should be blocked and staged to convey anything like urgency or irony. Look at the scene where the old Prince Bolkonsky walks in on Natasha and Marya talking. The point is he’s in his nightgown and didn’t expect Natasha to be there. Instead of acting flustered and embarrassed, he walks right up to Natasha, pauses, and goes, “Oh, I didn’t know you were here.” It reminded me of the flower shop scene in The Room. The cinematography in general constitutes nothing but flat angles and non-confrontational lighting. The music is useless and embarrassing. I don’t understand why music in movies before the 60s was so God damn intolerable. There’s no reason for this movie to exist. It has no ambition and does nothing to enhance or elevate or creatively interpret Leo Tolstoy’s novel. It doesn’t come close to standing as its own work without reference to the novel. Nobody who hasn’t read the book could possibly care about this movie. Not that someone who hasn’t read it should be watching this, but a movie needs to work on its own.",0,war-and-peace

31249,"105 Movies Throughout the Year(s) #42: Its bluntness knows no end.- lol please disregard my dumbass ruminations on existential nihilism; i no longer subscribe to it in any fashion though i still mean everything elsePedestrian philosophy explored through a superfluously focused microscope, expository abrasiveness a prominent factor in one of Bergman's most revered. Bergman expresses his ideologies (of vast simplicity; elegant concepts of inevitability, borderline-truculently negative views of faith, and the concept of death as an anthropomorphic personification each explored in the most paltry possible manners) vicariously through the fictitious Antonius Block - the protagonist.Block has just returned from The Crusades to find his country afflicted by the plague, apocalypse befalling what he knew to be his home. Block finds Death (personified), and challenges Death to a game of chess. Death, bemused by Block's stark attitude, accepts, and agrees to the terms - that if Block wins, he may continue living, and if he loses, he will not be permitted to do so. Block believes he can outrun Death's tentative grasp by stalling in the chess game, and he does indeed do so.Death wins in the end, Block's valiant efforts to win the game all for naught - one can't cheat death, and to try is to attempt a fool's errand by definition.Themes of faith are explored a bit, a mild though potent critique of faith-based religion is portrayed; that to worship a deity at all is to blindly follow them, all in the words of Block.In The Seventh Seal, Bergman is confronting his own mortality, invaluably accepting that his death is of course inevitable and eventual. He appears to debase faith-based religion at its core. My issues lie within how these messages are portrayed -- they are delivered through expository lines of dialogue and that alone, and the fact that Bergman feels he needs to reinvent the medium into an apocryphal Ted Talk just to illustrate such extraordinarily simple philosophical concepts shows a true lack of creativity and artistic ability in him. The messages are unmistakable, for you are beaten over your head with them countless times.I do however agree with Bergman's philosophies, and accepting death is something vital to not only the experience of life itself but also the fundamental concept of existential nihilism (something I strongly believe in/agree with, as I much-too-often mention I'm sure), and I'm glad he did so (Bergman said that this film was in fact therapeutic for him and helped him through his apparent ""crippling fear of death""). His fundamental destruction of faith in this particular manner is something I admire and also agree with. But, alas, neither of these ideas are presented with any creativity, nor are the ideas at hand really profound in the slightest -- Bergman made an unintelligent, aggressively blunt film that healed him and repelled me.",3,the-seventh-seal

It was my first Akira Kurosawa and I did not like it. It was too long, half of the samurai's were wasted and forgetable, the humour was misplaced and, please now don't hate me anymore than you already do, Toshiro Mifune's acting was poor and he overacted in every scene.Then Rashomon, the only Kurosawa film, besides this one, that I enjoyed every detail and second of. My ""latest"" watching of it was in November 2016, which is quite a long time ago, so I need to refresh my memory of it, but it maybe go upto a 5/5. Who knows?However, Rashomon gets better and more fascinating the more I think about. So when I watched it, I wasn't whole hearted a fan, which I now am.

7429,"An extensively investigated, thoroughly detailed & wickedly amusing crime opus that's stylishly directed & brilliantly acted, Goodfellas is considered by some people to be an even better crime drama than The Godfather and though I don't share the same sentiment, I can't deny its influence & impact on the films that followed into its footsteps.Goodfellas chronicles the rise & fall of mob associate Henry Hill & his friends from the 1950s to 1980s. The story follows his journey in the mafia world, covering his relationship with his wife and his two associates Jimmy Conway & Tommy DeVito, as the trio work their way up through the mob hierarchy, and culminates with the events that lead to their eventual downfall.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film begins in the middle and then work its way around it before coming full circle in the end, thus taking us on a riotous journey that's never tiring. The dialogues are sharp & piercing, the chemistry between the trio has a genuine quality & a sense of brotherhood to it. The violence is brutal & unflinching, and the characters are lively & compelling.The filmmaking technicalities are handled really well, giving its images a frenzied vibe as if things may explode anytime without warning, and they do on multiple occasions. Also notable is the neat cinematography that makes its apt set pieces stand out. But the story as a whole still feels longer than it needs to be, and its 145 mins runtime is severely felt during the second half.Coming to the performances, Goodfellas packs a reliable cast in Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci & Ray Liotta, with Pesci stealing the show with a wild, deranged act that overshadows all in his vicinity. Liotta is in as Henry Hill and delivers an impressive lead show that only gets better with time. De Niro chips in with an assured input yet he feels somewhat under-utilised. Lorraine Bracco & Paul Sorvino also provide excellent support and leave a lasting impression of their own.On an overall scale, Goodfellas captures the glamorous & grisly side of organised crime with finesse and offers a consistently thrilling ride to finish as a fascinating example of its genre. The story is at its best when the screen is shared by the trio but loses steam when it focuses on their individual lives. Riveting at first, the film ends up running a tad too long for me and the interest is already lost by the time it nears its conclusion. A well-researched account of a real-life story, Goodfellas is accomplished in its own ways but to call it equal to Francis Ford Coppola's classic is pure lunacy.",6,goodfellas

All joking aside, this one is going to be a little weird and dark, so strap right in.I've been suffering from mental health problems for as long as I can remember. Going back to my early years of school I recall struggling to communicate with other kids properly, finding the wrong things funny, wanting to talk about things that didn't seem okay to talk about, and most of all, not understanding why. I'd have these awkward experiences, I'd alienate people, I'd be outcasted by my peers despite being a good kid who always meant well.I've never seen a film like Mary and Max before, and I've been watching movies for a very long time. They were my solace away from the real world, distracting propaganda that told me for 2 hours that I could be a hero like the main character. That I could function normally and be attractive and have cool friends and go on adventures and be widely admired. Really, what I needed was a shock to the system like this. Something that slapped me in the face and screamed ""STOP. You're okay the way you are. You can live your life.""I suffered a very traumatic event around a few years ago, and the PTSD was triggered by something today, pretty bad. I got home from work, crawled into bed, stress-ate and turned to my Reclist for a cinematic distraction, just like in the old days. I could have never anticipated that something like Mary and Max would come along, help me to cry for a little while and let me release some of the pain.From the bottom of my heart, thank you for reading this and my reviews in general. Thank you for sending me things to watch and love. It really does help me.Recommend me a film!",9,mary-and-max

Luckily, I have never really been one to judge a film just based on the story, but instead on the execution, and as you’d expect with Kurosawa, it’s gripping from start to finish. It’s a lot more of a dialogue based film than I expected but I was still never bored, probably thanks to the always great filmmaking from Kurosawa.

There is not a speck of the glamour from films like House of Flying Daggers, and Hero. It was the success of this which probably earned him the respect and funding for those big budget films. Raise the Red Lantern, has a Kurosawa quality to it; very slow, very dramatic and very thought provoking.Raise the Red Lantern, has a very barren feeling, and with so many wide establishing shots, this truly does resemble a Kurosawa design (like e.g Ran). The story rumbles with a grim ambiance and hardly ever escalates to an overly-dramatic scale.

12266,"When you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.There is an air of melancholy in The Apartment that is instantly familiar to anybody who lives on the outside looking in. You're surrounded by perfectly nice people, you've got a job and you're doing pretty well for yourself, but then the holidays roll around and you realize you haven't got anybody to curl up beside and watch a Christmas movie with. But you shrug and go on with life anyway. C'est la vie, buddy.This ever-present problem is further exacerbated for Bud Baxter because he can't even go to his own home during the holidays. He trades the key to his apartment for undeserved promotions at his workplace, and he harbors a crush on an elevator girl, Fran. It seems that he'll be happy just to have a conversation with her now and then until he finds out that she's having an affair with his boss, Mr Sheldrake.It's obvious from the get-go that Bud and Fran will get together by the end. (Plus I'd already watched a Bollywood rip-off of The Apartment a few months ago.) But I certainly did not expect the characters to be so real. They're actually worried about getting enough sleep and about their jobs, and they are affected by their pasts in a way that affects their decisions in the present day.Take Fran, for example, played wonderfully by Shirley MacLaine. When she says that she has previously fallen for the wrong man in the past, it makes sense, because she obviously doesn't believe in true, everlasting love. She's much more practical than that. It's easy to roll your eyes at what could be considered silly melodrama - obviously Sheldrake is a charming jerk, and Fran would be an idiot to take him seriously - but when she overdoses on sleeping pills, you understand that it's all of her unfortunate experiences with love that compel her to take such a drastic step. Sheldrake is simply the final straw.And then there's Bud Baxter, played to perfection by Jack Lemmon. Bud is awfully lonely, but he's also a pragmatist; he smiles through daily humiliation and heartache because that's simply his nature. He knows how to shut up and deal. He's the ever-suffering nice guy, but unlike ""nice guys"" today, he never once assumes that Fran will love him simply because he loves her and cares for her while she falls for men who will inevitably leave her a bit more broken.The Apartment feels startlingly contemporary. Although it veers constantly from dark drama to cynical humor, the transitions are so seamless (and the moods so intertwined) that you never quite notice that your heart is twisting for these broken people one second, and then you're laughing out loud during the next scene.Billy Wilder and his co-writer's script is once again top-notch, with just the right amount of unforgettable lines among introspective exposition. The film looks beautiful, especially those rather disheartening office scenes at the beginning, and an atmosphere of oddly cheerful melancholy permeates every scene, every character.Nearly everybody in The Apartment is broken in some way. And these characters are like us, so we cheer for them, in spite of our own cynicism, because everything is logical but never cliché, despite the predictability of the plot. That's the thing about Billy Wilder: his characters may be part of a standard plot, but they are grounded in our world, instead of in a movie paradise where anything can be solved after a requisite bout of angst. And that's why everything he makes feels achingly true.",8,the-apartment

85937,"I love jazz music. Whether it's bebop, hard bop, modal jazz, free jazz, cool jazz, smooth jazz or jazz rap, it's some of the most interesting and exciting music for me. It's also one of the few genres that my dad and I can bond over, as he enjoys playing drums. In fact, he's even doing that right as I'm writing this review. It was only natural that we decided to finally watch this movie together today.Now, some of you may wonder why I gave the movie such a low rating (compared to the average score) if I love jazz so much. To put it simply: This is not a jazz movie. It's essentially a sports film decorated with cheap jazz attire. That doesn't automatically make it bad, but for being the only representation of jazz education in popular media, it felt so grossly exaggerated and misleading that it started to distract from the amazing cinematography and decent acting. If you're trying to engage your audience in a setting taken directly from real-life, at least have some level of consistency.A lot of the directions taken story-wise were predictable, and of course there's also the issue of inaccuracies, though I can't personally comment on that since I haven't attended jazz school, but hearing about it from people who have felt strange considering the director was a student himself. Granted, it's only natural for a movie to take creative liberties with its concept and not strive for complete realism, but even if you have basic knowledge of music, wasn't it odd for Andrew to practice playing as fast as possible to the point of bleeding when the songs themselves didn't necessarily need that? I'm pretty sure jazz is more about steady time keeping, but I guess that would be too subtle for this film since it's about as subtle as a punch to the snare drum with all the swearing, yelling and macho attitude going on.The movie was so busy emphasising the aspects of competition and struggle that it came across as soulless and utterly cynical, especially towards the idea of music making. According to this film, it's not about having fun or forming a friendly community, just mean-spirited competition and hierarchy. Like, do people find the abusive learning methods inspirational for some reason? Cause I can only imagine this will discourage most people to even step foot inside a jazz school. Also, how ironic that Fletcher condescendingly called modern jazz ""Starbucks jazz"" even though the piece he performed at the club had none of the energy that hip-hop infused jazz bands express in current day New York.I could go on about all that or the ridiculously vulgar dialogue that served little to no purpose from what I could tell, but at the end of the day, I'm not here to tell people they're not allowed to enjoy this movie because of how it misrepresents jazz education or music. Nonetheless, it perplexes me how it managed to reach such level of acclaim.",1,whiplash-2014
76788,"As a movie, the Green Mile is far too long, and extremely basic.  Every character is one-dimensional.  The dramatic beats of the story are all over the place.Wild Bill, a character defined by his over the top need to be disruptive, constantly disappears whenever they want to have a quiet, heartfelt scene 10' in front of his cell.But the biggest issue, by far, is the message of the movie.  An innocent black man is falsely convicted for child rape and murder and is put on death row.  The ostensible protagonists learn of his innocence, and the central conflict of the movie is how the poor white prison officers need to bear the emotional burden of executing the innocent man.  But don't worry, the black guy gives everyone a pass, explaining how it's okay that he gets the chair, Hanks shouldn't beat himself up about it.The worst part is that his innocence doesn't even seem to be a major plot point.  The movie’s main concern is that the prisoner is miraculous.  Hanks' dilemma isn't about executing an innocent man, or the systemic racism that railroaded him, Hanks is worried about killing a magic man who performs miracles.  It's an issue between Hanks and God, the black inmate is just a piece on the board.The white guards make no attempt to save the inmate, but it shows that they're really broken up about it as they execute him.  They're the true victims.  Hanks gets it even worse, as the miracle worker granted him extended health and life, and he's 108 years old, cursed to live!

52537,"Its so gratifying when you finally get around to watching a movie with such an immense reputation, and not only does it merit the praise, but even exceeds your high expectations. Festen is one of those iconic Scandi cinema touchstones that honestly I avoided for so long because of my aversion to the whole Dogme style of filmmaking, but also because I dislike Lars Von Trier films so much and assumed this would be the same. Silly me of course, as Id already watched and really enjoyed Another Round and The Hunt, two of Thomas Vinterberg's most recent films. The low budget, home movie style of visual aesthetic Vinterberg is going for here might be jarring at first, but its actually a perfect reflection of the story itself; the rough, dirty look of the film complimenting the abominable story and the characters inhabiting it. That home movie look also makes the film feel so intimate as well, as if we are privy to watching a family's most private moments captured on film. I don't want to spoil any of the story, as its that build up and slight but undeniable tension in the air that pervades the film's first half hour, right up to eldest son Christian's first speech at his Father's 60th Birthday celebration. And it hits like a fucking sledgehammer. And from that point on there is not turning back for this family. Over the course of the rest of the film, each must make peace with the pain, the guilt, and the trauma that has occurred, a dark secret that has hung over them for decades. Its quite obvious that Festen's dysfunctional family dynamic was a major source of inspiration for HBO's Succession, the pilot episode even titled ""The Celebration"", an obvious nod to this film. One aspect of the story I did find slightly confusing was Christian's relationship to the head Chef, friends from childhood, the chef obviously privy to the what has happened to Christian. I got the indication there was some grand plan they had hatched for this day in advance, whether it was going to be something malicious, like poisoning the Father, or something else antagonistic. The film I thought was definitely heading toward that conclusion, but no, that kind of felt like it was hinted at but just forgotten about by the end. But ultimately, this film has a power like few others. The story and the tension created is so expertly built up, the performances stray towards over the top but remain relatable and human, and within the limited framework that Dogme demands, Vinterberg still shows a lot of flare with his camera work, and uses the lack of visual clarity expertly, especially the grainy, darker night-time shots, where a candle or a cigarette lighter are the only sources of illumination. This film is incredibly dark, but powerful, at times beautiful, and even somewhat hopeful by its conclusion. I'm so happy I finally got around to watching this.",8,the-celebration
43679,"Before approaching Bondarchuk's War and Peace, I wanted to be be familiar with what it is working in response to, so here I am. I have not read Tolstoy's novel, but something tells me that a tale of aristocrats during wartime isn't necessarily going to be my cup of tea under the best circumstances. Still, there's plenty to pick apart that is specific to Vidor's adaptation.The first hour is totally half-baked. There are a tremendous number of characters and the film does not do a very good job of establishing them or their relationships. Vidor spends that time ping-ponging between their various storylines and under serving all of them in the process. It is clear, even to me as someone who has not read Tolstoy's novel, that many corners are already being cut. For as many writers as there are on this project, it feels like the pacing was figured out entirely in the edit, and that's certainly for the worse.It's not until the first ball scene that those details start to settle in. At that point, focus is placed firmly on Hepburn and there is finally a sense stability to the narrative, though the rhythm is still non-existent due to obviously omitted scenes. While this section is certainly an improvement over what preceeded it and Hepburn is as radiant as usual, I don't feel that this romance plot effectively serves the themes that are (poorly) established in the first act. Something tells me that Tolstoy didn't lean entirely on romantic melodrama at the expense of any notable thematic development.When the story shifts focus back to Fonda, things start to crumble even further. It's already bad enough that Ekberg and other actors were dubbed in the edit for having accents that were deemed ""too thick"" but it's even worse considering the one accent that breaks my immersion the most is Henry Fonda's. Nobody sounds particularly Russian, but only Fonda sounds like he was just plucked off of a soundstage in Los Angeles. It is very distracting. And it's not just how he sounds that's an issue.His voice is a contributing factor, but I just fundamentally don't buy Fonda's presence. He sticks out terribly. When he's traipsing around an active battlefield, dropping flowers on hilltops, it feels downright absurd. It's like the worst Mr. Magoo cartoon. This bumbling oaf wandering around and somehow not immediately dying undercuts the tension of the whole damn war, even though the presentational aspects of the battles were already pretty dire to begin with. Those battles are downright pitiful. Like the sets, they are impressive for their sheer scale, but they are pure pageantry. It never feels like there's real danger, it never feels like there's real chaos. It is too clearly choreographed, the explosives too neatly planted to afford that impression. The supposed horror of this war feels more silly than anything else. The only thing that's really ghastly (and I know I'm bound for far, far more of this in the Soviet adaptation) is the horse death. And all of that for what? So we can get Audrey Hepburn married, I suppose? Between all of the braindead and unresolved character threads about duty, this film doesn't seem to be about much else when it's all said and done.",4,war-and-peace

4976,"It was pretty good. Perfect blocking and directing, but overall not a great film in my opinion. I love Takashi Shimura but his performance here was really one-note. Lots of scenes, even very pivotal ones, seemed underwritten and not very substantial. Lots of techniques to make the audience sympathize with Watanabe fell flat, like awkwardly incorporated narration and heavy reliance on close-ups. Despite a fundamental sympathy for his terminal condition, regret, and despair, he felt too artificial to connect with the film in a meaningful way. I know he’s supposed to be a shell of a man, but I could see someone watching him and thinking “Well I’m not like that” and missing the whole point of the movie. In fact all the characters seemed to lack depth too. They all propped the themes up while, again, not feeling like people and their motivations felt implausibly two-dimensional and/or unclear. This might seem harsh but I’m shocked this movie has the renown it does. It consistently reminded me of similar movies that pulled its ideas off better (not to be cliché, but Citizen Kane and It’s a Wonderful Life came to mind frequently) and the heights Kurosawa reached on so many other occasions. This movie felt way longer than Seven Samurai and lacked much of the personality found in Kurosawa’s other films. It was pretty good and overall well shot but nothing at all special.",5,ikiru

8018,"Q: When did this Kaiju battle and teen school drama show turn into a batshit psychedelic philosophical diatribe?  A: Before this movie even started.Because of this movie's high placement in Top 250 lists, I invested the time to watch all 26 episodes of the TV show leading up to this finale.  The show (or at least 24 episodes of the show) was really good.  It was about a small group of 14 year old kids who, by nature of their ability to bond with and pilot these massive mech units, were humanity's only hope to fight off giant alien invaders. If I had stopped watching at episode 24, I would have chalked it up as a quirky but enjoyable anime that delved a little too deeply into psychoanalysis, but all in all a really good show.But this 90-minute finale went so far off the rails of what came before that I can't even begin to imagine how it ended up on those Top 250 lists. Narrative and plot are discarded. Logistics of movement through time and space are cast aside. Visual cohesiveness is entirely abandoned.  And the film becomes something of a treatise on psychology and human connection, while some kind of grotesque apocalypse is happening mainly in the background.Long story short, I'm not sure who this was made for, but it wasn't me.

Unless you're an avid watcher of silent films or a film school student, I don't see how this could hold someone's attention for 2h33m nowadays. I watched it in four sittings and still had a hard time finishing it. Clearly not for me.The repetitive music almost turned me insane, it's the one you hear when you're on hold on the phone or in an elevator. They played the same tune on repeat for 2h33m but it got better when I got the brilliant idea to put it on mute. That one note elevator music ruins the movie and any attempt at making the viewer feel the right emotions at the right time, you have a scene early on of someone threatening to commit suicide and this cheerful music playing over it—what the hell??I'd be more into this if it wasn't so hard to follow, not sure how some of the scenes connect or even what's happening most of the time until the scene is over.

2895,"You kind of have to admire the ambition of Charles Band’s Parasite.  It’s a sci-fi horror film originally released in 3-D and made on a budget of apparently two bucks.There is a lot of backstory here, a complex post-apocalyptic near future in which the haves control the suburbs and the have-nots live in more deserted regions.  Throw into this the titular Parasite, a genetically engineered creature that eventually gets some moments of cheap but pleasing FX.It’s cheap and it’s bad, but it’s also kind of enjoyable.  A very young Demi Moore is on display, very pretty and very Eighties.  Though Moore’s appearance is often noted, the film also features The Runnaways’ Cherie Currie in a smaller role.This was the 2nd film in my suckfest double feature, alongside 1960’s The Leech Woman, and I have to say the night sucked just fine, thank you.And the poster is pretty awesome.",3,parasite

15030,"This has been in my watchlist for quite some time and recently I found out that a lot of great older movies are free on YouTube which is very annoying but I’ve made a playlist of a bunch of classic or at least interesting films on YouTube for free : www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLumHMT1I0pFEjnagcTymVb0O5XKehunrqWow. If the third one is just as good as these last two which it could easily do given it’s the highest rated, that means lord of the rings will be replaced as my favourite trilogy.Masaki Kobayashi just understands pacing. I have now spent about 6 1/2 hours inside the world he has created and not a single second felt bland or uninspired. Kobayashi has created with this trilogy what can only be described as cinematic perfection. Both films feel larger than life while delivering story’s about normal people in the wrong places. So many great lines of dialogue that make us reflect and the crazy change from the beginning to the end of each film that our protagonist goes through is insane and Tatsuya Nakadai’s performance is absolutely phenomenal.One thing I was thinking while watching this film is how silently this film has influenced cinema today. There was probably a good 20 shots in this film that look identical to films shot by Roger Deakin's that are often hailed as the best shots in cinema. I’m talking 1917, blade runner, sicario, No country for old men and just so many others. There are moments that feel like Tarantino, Scorsese, Cuarón, Spielberg and Kubrick. This trilogy is insane. Full metal jacket was essentially a soft remake of this film. There are so many films often hailed as the greatest ever made that feel derivative of this trilogy but yet no attention ever comes to it. These films are a must watch for any cinema lover and are so overlooked.Going back to the film it is easily one of the best looking films I have ever seen. Every shot feels meaningful and progresses the story forward in the most natural way, the sequence of events that unfold are somewhat messy with many different characters left to the side or just straight abandoned. This might not be for everyone but I think it’s interesting as most of the time our lives don’t have consistent secondary characters and this is especially true for war.If I had one problem with this movie it’s that I didn’t feel as horrified as the first. In the first much of the violence is implied and we never truly see shocking images in terms of gore and I loved this. It’s not a big complaint but it seems there were times in this movie where they didn’t stick to the style they set up in the first. This is such a small issue in a basically perfect film. Something I found interesting was that  “suicide squad” is a line in this movie and a character named Naruto runs and tackles some guards .If you want to die here’s a fun drinking game for this trilogy:1) Take a shot if someone gets slapped2) Take a shot if someone cry’s or has a breakdown3) Take a shot if the camera dramatically pulls in closer to the characters4) Take a shot if someone yells “you dog” as an insultDefinitely don’t do this game you’ll be dead within the first 20 minutes.9.9/10",9,the-human-condition-ii-road-to-eternity

The camerawork was very amateurish, and the stale music could be dusted off from time to time. There are quite a few things that are very unbelievable. I understand the thought behind this film; life is always beautiful and remain optimistic, whatever is happening. All well and good, but it’s not interesting. I don't agree with that message either.Also, I’m cool with making comedies about WW2/ Holocaust (even though the focus here is more about the father’s love), and you could ask yourself wether to find it tasteful or not.

14793,"When i talked about that i think this is the best depiction of war ever, i didn't talk about how much this movie gives insight into the life of a soldier (which is kaji), it shows you his moments of hardship, hope, bitterness and even rare moments of happiness.Now if i'm being honest i'm not really sure if this or the first one is better, this is still perfect in pretty much every sense of the word, there's even a few things that are improved here.Kaji gets a lot of chracter development and i think he may have just become my favorite chracter oat, i am genuinely convinced that this might be the best chracter study that i've ever seen.Kaji's chracter is so complex and interesting, the subjects that his chracter is symbolising are so important and compelling.(Spoilers in this part)The main theme of his chracter is his dilemma between helping himself and helping the greater good, there are moments where he's willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good, he also always tries to be as good as he can in the situation that he's in and stand up for what's right, there's a scene here where he was mercilessly beaten but even than he still was ready to stand for his values, the ending scene of the film was perhaps the only time he puts himself first instead of others and i'm really interested to see how that's gonna play out in the next film which is the last of the trilogy.What this film said about nationality was also really interesting, kaji is obviously opposed to dying for your country and blindly supporting it, but there's one scene here that stuck out for me where he shows he does care about his nation which is why he didn't wanna run away from it to achieve his own freedom, which is again a part of the larger theme of his chracter where he's trying to act for the greater good rather than himself.(No spoilers from here)Apart from the fantastic writing, the acting of this film is spectacular, it's very dramatic and over the top but it does actually work here really well, the best out of the japanese movies i've seen from that time that have a similar type of acting.One thing that does make the first movie better than this is it's much more focused on it's moral dilemma but i think road to eternity overall was more thought provoking and complex but both are two of the best movies i've ever seen, i think after i finish the trilogy, this might just become my favorite thing ever.Perfection 100/100",8,the-human-condition-ii-road-to-eternity

I understand that, basically, it is the granddaddy of all my favorite movies, and for that I cannot thank it enough.Unfortunately, not being any sort of professional in film or cultural history, I have to rate my movies independently of the context of those histories in which they exist. While I am certain that, at the time, this film was, if not revolutionary, at least exemplary in technique and plot, the cumulative nature of film has habituated me from being dazzled by the methods and narrative employed.

55775,"Akira’s sci-fi post-apocalyptic cyberpunk aesthetic reminded me a lot of the original Blade Runner, with not only the combination of its darker shades but futuristic visuals. The animation leans into the streaky black and neon mix, and while it certainly looks great I thought the direction was a little too tight for my liking - as the majority of the shots feel too compact and the composition is almost never really able to breathe. This is rather unfortunate, as Akira builds such an awe-inspiring presence in its take on this chaotic portrayal of Tokyo, and I would’ve liked it to be framed more loosely. In the end I’m just some random viewer with no film experience but that’s my take. Even after decades of the sci-fi genre following it, Akira still feels convoluted in the plot at times. For a film that juggles its amount of plot threads it moves quite quickly. It’s not even in the sense that the story moves fast, but in the fact sequences move with such a large amount of quick short scenes with each adding its own information and contribution to the story. Akira kind of just throws you right into the action, and most of the time I like it when films do this, but there’s a lot to take in and it never takes time to slow down. I still love how this film doesn’t hold back in its action though, as there’s no shortage of gore and violence. It’s a refresher when at least the vast majority of animated films I’ve watched recently have been so gentle. As one who’s super inexperienced in the genre of anime, I’ve only seen a couple shows and so far Attack on Titan S3 was the best thing ever. I, like in that season, really appreciated the expansive action but I felt less attachment to the characters here and didn’t feel as much buildup as I would’ve liked. The film finally comes together in its third act, and while I feel like the character moments are underwhelming the dynamic between Tetsuo and Kaneda is compelling enough to be engaging. I liked the part when they screamed each other’s names. 6/10.",5,akira

A person's last film.'From the opening 20 minutes or so of Tampopo, I was solidly sold on this 'ramen western,' with its fairly seamless transitions from the main storyline to anthological side stories, rich depictions of delicious-looking food, and its stylized, quirky homages. The main plot focuses on Tampopo, a widow trying to improve her ramen recipe, as she enlists the help of a gas truck-driving cowboy (and various other men) to essentially play Frankenstein and cobble together their own carbaceous monster from stolen elements of other ramen restaurants' recipes.Unfortunately, past those first 20 minutes, I found that the more I watched Tampopo, the more I grew annoyed with it. The sound design was downright irritating at times, such as the loud slurping noises during the etiquette lesson and the drilling noises in the dentistry scene. There was also a bit too much literal food porn for me, with one of the recurring side couple's function seeming to be to look attractive, break the fourth wall, and have weird food sex.Something I haven't seen a lot of people (or any, really) mentioning was how the framing of two child characters, the teenage oyster girl and the young ice cream boy, came off as completely uncomfortable. For instance, we watch the former as she lets a man eat a dying oyster from her hand and licks the blood from his lips. Also, she is shown in a couple of close-ups in a sort of softly lit, 'romantic interest in a romcom' framing that struck me as gross.... Speaking of gross, I'm not sure how I've made it this far without mentioning the elephant in the room, which is the gratuitous instances of animal abuse. I had to fast-forward through the infamous soft-shell turtle killing scene, but there was also the decapitated pig's head and oyster shucking on top of the general kitchen gore. It's not like I expected veganism in my Japanese ramen movie from 1985, but I think the film could've gone with approximately none of that and been all right.Despite wanting to love it, I ultimately found that Tampopo did not work for me. Beyond everything else I said above, I also cared far more about the actual Tampopo's plot than I did anything else that was going on, so it just felt bloated and annoying. I even sat on writing this review until the morning after watching it because some people said it works better upon further reflection! It's certainly not incompetently made or anything, but the issues I mentioned are pretty much deal-breakers for me. I find that being by far in the minority opinion about fairly universally highly regarded films is always an interesting position to occupy. Lots of people love this one, but it's just not for me! Oh well, onto the next film... maybe with a bowl of ramen",1,tampopo

It is such a tourist’s view of violence and crime; the boys are literally gleaming because Fernando Meirelles is so distracted by what kind of playground he can make out of a destitute, dangerous neighborhood. But Meirelles does it all in the name of “authenticity” as though he wants all of his frenetic camerawork (which is just as mindless as the treatment of the neighborhood itself) to serve as some kind of statement. Some people do not know that City of God was co-directed by Kátia Lund and it makes so much sense that it is a work of two directors because the direction of the actors is the one good thing about the movie. Lund had experience documenting violence in Rio de Janeiro and Meirelles admits that she was the one who directed all of the non-professional child actors. Of course, only Meirelles was nominated for best director at the Oscars, and he has tried to downplay Lund’s contributions profusely. Apparently the novel the movie is based on—written by Paulo Lins, who grew up in the real life City of God—is much more dense than the movie itself, and that is both impressive in the sense that the screenwriter Bráulio Mantovan managed to streamline it, but it also makes perfect sense that the movie is such a clusterfuck.

41622,"100 (and 5) Movies Throughout the Year(s) #25: Ignorance is rarely virtuous.The Great Dictator, a much-too-cutesy saga regarding World War II is one of the most well-intentioned but simultaneously insensitive films/pieces of media in general in recent and distant years.Chaplin's childlike view of nazi brutality would be much more endearing if he was at the very least self-aware, perhaps even a mockery of those who don't handle the subject of the holocaust with sensitivity (yes, technically the holocaust began in '41 and this came out a year prior, but there was still a depressing amount of nazi brutality preluding the official holocaust), but sadly, no - Chaplin finds this particular subject matter something to play around with in a deeply asinine, insensitive manner that feels pretty unforgivable.Chaplin's ostensible lies about his understanding of World War II and disregard for his source material is baffling - he stated that had he known about the holocaust he would never had released the film, and yet - there are references to gas chambers (most infamous due to the holocaust) and the like, and additionally, the film was released as nazi Germany began to occupy France. So while the holocaust technically hadn't occurred by the time of the film's release, it was still released in the midst of World War II, something that he was obviously aware of. The protagonist (""the Jewish barber"", as he's credited) is quite obviously portrayed as a Jewish individual - one who has fallen prey to a fascist regime, all at the hands of Adenoid Hynkel. It's quite possibly the bluntest allegory I've ever made note of - and I've seen Vivarium. While I suppose all that is fine on its own, any claim that Chaplin has made about not being knowledgeable enough about the situation at hand is rendered null by his ostensible knowledge of at very least the basics of his subject matter, which already should've been enough to sway his creative tendencies in the way of not making a satire about nazism. You'd think it'd be common sense - apparently not, sadly.",3,the-great-dictator

33989,"Steve's Priority Watchlist ProjectMaybe this is to be expected of just about anyone but I know my taste in film has matured as I've got older.I've become far more receptive to films like Landscape in the Mist but maybe I'm doing my younger self a disservice. I remember in my late teens and university days happily staying up haf the night watching whatever arthouse European film Channel 4 had on that night on a good few occasions. So maybe I haven't changed that much at all.One thing that's definitely changed is how I view films with children. An almost certain side-effect of having my own children. I get very angry indeed when I see a film like Landscape in the Mist, as such. It's not just for the child rape scene, which isn't shown in much detail at all, but it is needlessly vile and made me very angry indeed for its sheer suggestion alone. But hey, every 'poetic!' and 'beautiful!' film should have one after all!It's also the scene with the dying horse, which clearly is one that genuinely upsets these two children with no acting involved at all. If you can't make your navel-gazing art piece without risking psychologically damaging your young artists, then maybe you shouldn't be doing this in the first place.That's not to say the rest of it isn't a ridiculously self-serious slog as it is, but I think the above stuff is far more important to me.

87645,"I struggle with biopics at the best of time.  Especially ones that reach way back into the subject's biography to grab episodes from every decade.  Unfortunately, not only does MALCOLM X do this, and in my view blur a film's cinematic central narrative through episodic distraction, but Spike Lee's thorough film produces a lulling 200-minute journey.Not may bag.  Too many speeches.  Too many episodes.  Too many similar episodes painting the picture of one of Malcolm's era.  Too many characters too similar in nature and too similar their function.  Only Washington, Freeman Jr., and Bassett emerge with much character variation.Although I learned a lot about Malcolm X, this was not a satisfying watch.  I appreciate, though, Lee's colorful cinematic devices.  His bluesy score, lush cinematography, and his popular frontal camera-tracking stuntery breathe life into the three-and-a-half hour epic, but they could not ultimately save a production that would probably have been a richer mini-series.B-",4,malcolm-x-1992

Usually I get bored by the dramatic elements of Chaplin's work, while largely appreciating the gags and set-pieces. Here, not only are the dramatic elements unbearably boring, the gags and set-pieces are almost aggressively unfunny. Gags here included: 5 minutes of eating spaghetti normally with a string mixed in, 5 minutes of pouring liquid on someone, 5 minutes of falling in the water, 5 minutes of hiccups that produce a whistle. In other words, I was counting the minutes till the film was over.

I couldn't look away for a second. It's such an overwhelmingly powerful experience I sat through the full credits just to adjust to my living room again.The soundscape has a slight atmospheric eeriness which is inexplicably immersive, despite being almost musicless. The sound design is phenomenal, perfectly getting under the skin in all the best worst ways. I really appreciated the variety of sets and locations, even into the final act. Every detail, on screen and on the page is meticulously thought out. The script is tight and efficient, yet it also gives backstory to each character and story point without a single moment of unnatural exposition. Everything feels absolutely real and necessary. The filmmaking is nearly emotionless, but this only intensified the emotions in my mind. One of my favorite moments is in the two diner scenes: in the first one, he barely touches his food, but in the second one, he wipes the plate clean. A wonderful moment of purely visual character work, and scenes like this are all throughout. I've seen nearly every Film Lads Film Club movie this cycle (9 of 12).

41544,"The Great Dictator is a message to mock dictatorship during World War II. Charlie plays two characters: Hynkel and Barber. Hynkel made to mock Adolf Hitler, furious behavior, mustache, etc. The Barber is his typical Charlie protagonist, a helpless man in a dying situation where he meets a girl. He falls in love and wants to achieve greatness to fit equally or be deemed worthy of her.It is the first Charlie film that features conversation. Although Modern Times has sound, it is not at the same level as The Great Dictator. Because the main plot involves World War II, the message is obviously to be the cruelty of the dictatorship. The last message to people reflects Charlie's perspective on war precisely. In My Autobiography Charlie Chaplin Book, he has the privilege of being a man who doesn't have to enlist in war because the film he made brings joy to the soldier and increases morale, giving hope for humanity. So, the government wants him safe instead. Charlie never chooses a side in this war. He is more like a neutral person because he believes war is terrible and only benefits people are the one above, not the soldier who goes into the war. I like his message.

Every time it seems like it’ll finally begin to scab over, you press and pick and pull at it, bringing forward a new wave of pain. This is motherhood. This is being a daughter. Generational ache that reaches the very center of the tree, sinks down into the deepest roots. A withholding that leaves you hollow. In Autumn Sonata, the distinction between sentimentality and feeling is made crystal clear, mother and daughter on either side of the line. How they wield these sensations is the magic at the heart of the film. A beating, bleeding thing, its devastatingly beautiful dialogue like a never-ending wail. Charlotte can remember exactly what piece she was performing, decades later, at a moment’s notice, but she cannot remember her daughters’ faces or whether or not Eva likes chocolate. “Do you like me?” “I love you.” “Do you?”",9,autumn-sonata

It’s sets a compelling stage where danger could be lurking right out of anyone’s house.

This girt that film Carries also give it a strong feeling of realism almost feel like a straight up documentary at times. It’s a gritty violent reflection on people fighting against colonization in way that turns their streets into a war zone and a lot of blood to be spilled.

Damn shame because my first David Lean film was Doctor Zhivago, which should have been the all time best omen for the great films I would soon experience when going through his filmography, but so far it just hasn’t happened. I feel a little bit kinder toward Lawrence of Arabia only because the great performances and character writing were almost enough to make me ignore the crushing length, but The Bridge on the River Kwai couldn’t even do that with a full hour shaved off. I do kind of prefer this one anyway, even though the fact that the basic synopsis absolutely did not interest me was a bad sign. I can ignore an average idea if the characters are great, but they’re exactly as average as the idea, which means it all evens out to a painfully middling experience that, for me, for the most part, failed to justify its own existence.

Black pedagogy, aggression, bullying and Billy with his hawk. The actors are ok. This was the first film for the main actor and many of the supporting characters. The pictures are mediocre at best. The cut is clumsy. One could think that perhaps Loach couldn't do any better back then. But that's definitely not true. POOR COW from 1967 is visually much more elegant.Incomprehensibly to me, why this is exactly one of the few Loach films that has been seen by many friends on Letterboxd and is relatively popular. Why? My guess is that it's about a lovable poor outside boy who trains an animal and grows from it. Does that touch the audience´s hearts? The much better POOR COW from the same period has a rather problematic protagonist. That´s maybe why people prefer KES.

72853,"In Eureka, determined prospector Jack McCann (Hackman) finds his fortune in gold in the Yukon, becomes one of the world's richest men, and buys his own Caribbean island (""Eureka""), where he discovers money can't by him happiness.Based on the book ""Who Killed Sir Harry Oakes?"" by Marshall Houts, Eureka is an ambitious film by director Nicolas Roeg and screenwriter Paul Mayersberg. It features excellent performances from Gene Hackman and Teresa Russell. Eureka is a study of obsession, a treatise on the way realpolitik interweaves with family politics, and a searing critique of greed and capitalism.It is also complete rubbish.This is a great shame, as somewhere under this cinematic failure is a potentially great film about the USA. Paul Thomas Anderson must have seen this - so parallel in many ways are Hackman's Jack McCann and Day-Louis' Daniel Plainview from 'There Will Be Blood'. (The ""stricking gold; stricking oil"" scenes early in each film is especially resonant.)But almost everything Anderson does right, Roeg does wrong. Roeg's stylistic affectations were never more distracting from the narrative - never more a challenge to the audience ""suspending disbelief"" and being lost in the film - than in Eureka. These affectations are at their worst in the first act, where they aren't just weird, but downright goofy.The last act is also a fail, although I blame this more on the screenplay itself than Roeg's direction of it. For example, the court scene where Rutger Hauer's Claude, defending himself from a murder charge, cross examines his wife Tracey (Russell), is a great idea for a climax. She has to essentially savage him as a person (and, more broadly, deconstruct all the issues and events in the film) as a way of demonstrating that he can't be guilty of murder. It's a great ruse, but (unlike some other scenes) so badly written: pretentious, repetitive, overlong and melodramatic. Russell's performance here is both suburb and yet absurd - but she can only work with what she's been given.The middle act, in particular, had just enough wit, coherency, and intrigue to make me think this film had the makings of something strong, maybe even great. So much so that I can't bring myself to give this mess less than a two star rating, but that's the best I can do. Like Russell, I can only work with what I've got.",3,eureka

Each new generation is more and more intellectually, morally, physically and spiritually diluted than the outgoing one they supplant. So what? Who gives a shit?

Let inequity and disease hiss and foam and strip the human artifact down to blanched bones that artfully catch the fading light. And most importantly, let us stay so still and so silent. Stop trying to prop up the emperor, you dumb dildo. The human race isn’t something to perfect, or to be fetishized.

This films was utterly fantastic. First of all, the performances are fantastic. What these actors have to suffer through is pretty insane. I could only imagine the physical pain and stress these actors were going through. There was one shot in particular were a character is dropped from pretty high up and I was just shocked. Did he broke his legs?? You just don’t see actors truly pushing themselves to the max of their comfort zones. They weren’t just impressive to watch in the sense that they were doing extremely physical things, but they were also just fantastic performances. Eiji Okada as the lead was extremely powerful and mentally broken. The suffering he endures due to the situation he is put in is just hard to watch. How he deals with his sexual frustrations and overall mental state is just fascinating to watch and just increases over the course of the film. He is always trying new ways to achieve his goal but there is always something pushing him back. Kyôko Kishida was also amazing as an extremely troubled and mysterious character. She is so simple minded and just doesn’t understand much which makes her so innocent. The way both of these characters play off each other and communicate is so fascinating to watch and the way information is delivered through them is pretty clever. The cinematography was outstanding. It felt like every shot was different and that’s really saying something as most of this film is set in one place. The vast shots of desserts of extraordinary and whenever there is a sort of avalanche, it always looks so stunning. The lighting was also really well done with many of the shots only being lit by lamp. Whenever characters transferred from inside to outside it would also look so well done.  The production design even though small was extremely well done and was used to full affect. The way the whole location is used for the characters just makes it so interesting to watch and also makes the story very unique. The music was insane. In many scenes it isn’t used, as it isn’t needed, but when used it also adds the sense of foreboding tension. It’s quiet and mysterious yet also very intense. It was especially used well in the first half of the film with many of the shots looking innocent but with the music in the background it made me feel a different emotion.I am very shocked that this doesn’t get really any attention at all. It is a fascinating story with brilliant characters and I’m pretty sure most people would like it. Some scenes are uncomfortable but apart from that it’s pretty easy to recommend to anyone.",8,woman-in-the-dunes

From the performances, cinematography, and directing. It’s definitely a well made movie on a filmmaking perspective. On a story and character perspective however, it really didn’t work for me. Despite that the first half showed some promise, it became a chore the more it goes on because the second half was repetitive and dull. I know that it’s told in an episodic structure, but scenes just randomly happen and don’t matter to the story. I really wanted to love this movie, but sadly I couldn’t. Although, it’s not awful just very disappointing. Now I’m worried that 8½ will be mid too, maybe it’ll be great, I’ll have to wait and see.",3,la-dolce-vita
69873,"Letterboxd Season Challenge: Week 30 — Director Recommendations: Martin ScorseseThe only film role ever taken by Italian linguist and professor Carlo Battisti, Umberto D. is a step further toward sad cinema than even those other dour neorealists were attempting at the time. Umberto D. is arguably closer to Make Way for Tomorrow or Tokyo Story in its soft yet cynical plight of those we as viewers grow to love. In this case, the elderly Umberto and his dog Flike. In seeing neorealism through a lens of vulnerability and perhaps innocence, what might have been smaller details to larger stories instead become the majority of this film's interest. It isn't simply wallowing in its own tragedy, however, as Vittorio De Sica sees a humble beauty in the things being challenged or lost, culturally and personally.I still might not call De Sica my favorite of this entire movement, but part of the distinction he makes for himself in Umberto D. is that he takes the human element here to make a piece of a larger puzzle. That piece doesn't even need a movement surrounding it; just the atmosphere of decay and depression that goes so much further than its frame. Despite being so focused on this one particular story, Umberto D. is just as powerful in feeling what isn't always seen. A silent and uncertain end of one's world, with the shadows of others distant and resonant. The thought that the world will be beautiful without you, sometimes in spite of you. And its truest conclusion is not one for us to see.",8,umberto-d

79766,"For Gustavo BarrosAmour is a film that would no doubt affect anyone who has personally dealt with the subject matter personally, on account of the bleak, realistic presentation. It presents the tragedy of watching a loved one slowly succumb to a deteriorative disease, all within the context of a long, long marriage that shows how impossible a detrimental change like this can be somberly horrific bear. All of this likely gave plenty of reason to award the film the Palme D'or in 2012 and honor Michael Haneke for a second time, and should warrant me respecting it more than what my rating entails. Yet in presenting this bleak horror for what it is, Haneke utilizes his distinct style that, like my experience with Cache, proves too clinical and too slow for my tastes. His method of filmmaking certainly has its intentions, most of them justified, but it leaves me struggling to accept it for what it is and frustrated for not getting that same feeling Nanni Moretti and the jury felt when this premiered at Cannes.Boldly opening with firemen breaking into husband and wife Georges and Anne's apartment and finding her deceased, showing the end result and leaving speculation as to how we get here, much of the scenes we see of the two as Anne grows more helpless in her condition are grueling to watch. Caused from a stroke and a failed operation that leaves her paralyzed on one side, Anne has to be helped by George, acting as a caretaker, to tend to her daily needs and become more of a dependent. The way that we see how difficult it becomes to maintaining their relationship, not helped by a sense of hopelessness from Anne that cause a will to live to disappear is truly heartbreaking and does bring up some questions on how we perceive love, and how its everlasting nature can be so easily challenged (even in one of the film's final moments, presenting a capper sickeningly loving in its ethically flawed nature).While I've been known to praise the hell out of any director that creates a unqiue style to really pinpoint who is directing any one film, Haneke's style is something I simply can't get into as much as everyone else. I do love the way some of his long, static shots avoid making our main characters the focal point, most prominently in a opening concert scene, and the way he lets things linger does allow one to feel more like a bystander to the events, too stunned to really move at all and just stare at the tragedy unfolding. However, all throughout I was left merely cold and emotionally distant from the events I witness, acknowledging the horrors but never truly empathetic and more focused on making sure I could stick with it to its conclusion. I'm not necessarily opposed to the idea of slow films, as Tarkovosky's metaphysical poeticism in Solaris impressed me greatly, but the more blunt, down-to-earth form of slow Haneke prefers is one that feels like an acquired taste, something that should feel fruitful given his tendencies to prefer details rather than the big picture. Amour is a film I still like for what it is, having a point to make on the power of memory over the object of memory itself, but the estrangement that Haneke uses in order to convey that same feeling his characters go through dulls the impact the pain here could have on me.",6,amour

I just want to be by your side. I'm so fond of you. Being with you like this is my greatest happiness. Please, father, why can't we stay just as we are? I know marriage won't make me any happier.”Yasujiro Ozu’s Late Spring (Banshun, 1949) the first installment of Ozu’s ""Noriko trilogy"" The others being Early Summer (Bakushu, 1951) and Tokyo Story (Tokyo Monogatari, 1953) are self-standing tales featuring an epitome of a Japanese family and a reoccurring character named Noriko played by Setsuko Hara. Although I have yet to watch Early Summer, I can safely assume that the theme most likely would be akin to the two films and I would have the same admiration towards it. In Late Spring, the concept of traditional as opposed to modern approach on marriage of Japanese culture that lingers all throughout the film questions the viewers and Noriko “When is the perfect time to start thinking about marriage in one’s life? Are you willing to give up your family and start a new one?”. It depicts the reluctant but inevitable path towards marriage, the pressure of one’s family, relatives and friends clashing the traditional and modern theory relating to marriage. The differences of belief are also witnessed with the introduction of divorce and remarriage, as shown in one of the scenes in the bar, wherein Setsuko Hara’s character Noriko called in a jokingly manner her Father’s colleague as an unclean and dirty old man when she knew about his remarriage to another woman implicating disgust and lack of respect to his former wife, another scene wherein her friend would say that all men are sly and that as soon as you get married their true colors would be shown eventually ending up to a divorce due to her dismal experience and news about their long-time friend during a reunion. The scene of her aunt making arrangements for her to meet prospects to marry and the unending question of finding someone and being alone for the rest of your life, to name a few.  Further, Ozu portrays filial relationship like no other film. Both Setsuko Hara and Chishu Ryu effortlessly encapsulates a compelling father-daughter relationship and existing inseparable bond between them. The feeling of contentment and stability with her father coupled with his codependency when it comes to house work and maintenance of living an old life rendering much love, attention and care which is why the departure would make a great sense of loss and despair. We empathize with the daughter in her reluctant behavior since there is no certainty of what the future is and the eventuality of marriage. As to the father, he is left with no choice but to accept the nature and cycle of life and the conclusion that happiness is something you create yourself. I have already done my part as a father. My love for you is immeasurable. It is time for me to rest and sit on memories we had. My life is nearing its end, now is the time for you to start yours.",8,late-spring

Melodramic as it can be, Raise the Red Lantern excellently mixes viewer expectation with plot realizations to make some parts of this movie, date I say shocking. The acting is great, the characters are well developed and it is directed extremely well despite the huge number of ongoing plots, changing seasons and relationships within the film.Even though I liked its style and cinematography, the film is technically flawed. It is slow to get going and in the end overstays it’s welcome. It tries to drag itself out which hurts the movies overall impact. Also I didn’t find any of the characters particularly likableWhich made the film less relatable and engaging later on despite their constant development.Overall Raise the Red Lantern has a few good surprises but ultimately fails in the execution and pacing of the film’s main characters who come off as divas more than they do real people. 3.5/5",6,raise-the-red-lantern

51156,"As a piece of thrilling and physical cinema, Das Boot is outstanding. The oft talked about sense of oppression, claustrophobia and tension persists throughout the film. The sense of place is perfectly achieved, the interior of the submarine stuffed with atmosphere and the feel of the real. The camera marks this place with confidence and sells it to the viewer sublimely.If the sole goal is evocation, this is a wonder. You can critique the narrative structure and the writing that underpins this, but the transmitting of the scenario is never compromised. It is helped by strong performances, certainly, where the boat’s crew have real life on screen beyond what their written actions could suggest.But, there is a hollowness to Das Boot. Maybe it’s the looser pacing or the Director’s Cut I watched. While the film doesn’t drag, it does feel baggy. It maintains interest through the force of the filmmaking even when the overall structure isn’t carrying its weight. But, this repetitive and somewhat directionless feel does tie back to the intent and the situation.Really, there’s a core ‘why’ to get past. It’s perhaps too low level of a critique, the fruit that’s already on the floor, never mind hanging close to it: why do I have to spend so much time with Nazis? This film is not blind to the cruelty of the war machine, and the opening presents an unpleasant society. However, it’s objective and primarily apolitical lens craft odd emotional responses. The critique is a very general one when it exists in a very specific scenario. The film exists without a lot of wider context, which folds back to the presentation of claustrophobic isolation. But, there is a touch of creating empathy here. Which makes sense, these people are in a horrible scenario. It is a reminder that war is fought by pawns — primarily — pushed to do bidding they have no choice in. But this is a simplification and the lack of wider details can cause some odd allegiances. The perspective chosen here is the one the story demands for its effect to work, but it also creates an unintended unease. The cinematic energy is strong enough to craft conventional emotional and heroic stakes and the film ultimately doesn’t do anything interesting with this.",5,das-boot

Orson Welles apparently once said this film would ""make a stone cry"" and although I didn't outright cry myself, that ending especially did certainly give me a good ol' lump in my throat. Time moves in a way where it has no sentimentality. It's not against you, it just certainly isn't doing you any favors. It's therefore up to humanity to pick up the slack and give hope for tomorrow, meaning that new things are always on the way, but that things that are ""old"" are knowingly reaching an expiration date. Make Way for Tomorrow offers a nuanced, surprisingly humorous, and mostly just downright powerful portrayal of old age, long love, regrets, secret desires, and how although we may not exactly be guaranteed a perfect ending, there's got to something in our lives that made it all worth going through.

22837,"I opted to watch Hertzfeldt's magnum opus of sorts in the full length feature version rather than the trilogy of short films that comprise it. This I believe and from what I have seen in this final result helps achieve a seamlessly edited story and a more engrossing experience for the viewer to bare witness to the ongoing struggle and mental deterioration of the protagonist Bill.I admit after first being introduced to Hertzfeldt's comedic shorts with his crude stick figure animation, I was not as keen to hop on his bandwagon as everyone else. His brand of humor while exceedingly random and absurd was often on the borderline of being just outright stupidly silly. However there were always moments when I saw the potential he had from his signature style (the stick figure template and absurd comedy) but never would I have thought he would be capable of this. It's Such a Beautiful Day is one of the most unique film experiences that anyone could ever have. Again utilizing his trademark animation but also heavily experimenting with different editing techniques, visuals, live action shots, music and sound. The culmination of all of these rattled effects makes the film of a nearly avant garde format yet Hertzfeldt still captures the beauty of his narrative with complete ease. Bill is a man with some form of a debilitating mental disease and the audience experiences the film through his persona. This provides Hertzfeldt with so much freedom in context that he graciously takes advantage of and herein lies the brilliance of his conceit.We have a story of a protagonist whom we never hear speak only his thoughts and ruminations spoken via narration and yet we develop a deep seeded sympathy for him. Mind you this is a stick figure drawing that is eliciting a genuine emotional response from his audience. Now while the film is a visually compelling piece in the way Hertzfeldt experiments with his editing and juxtaposition between different forms of the medium, I still would gander to say the bulk of the film's prowess weighs heavily on the film's narration. Poetically composed, the narration is the key element to telling Bill's story and connecting to his character through his thoughts. Without it, the film may still look bold but would be nothing more than a hollow shell.As it is with all items present and accounted for, Hertzfeldt has made a beautiful film that has far exceeded my expectations. This is one to be excited over and gives you the fever to want to spread the word and show this to as many people as possible.",7,its-such-a-beautiful-day

71321,"Akira Kurosawa's only non-Japanese film presents the revered filmmaker journeying to Soviet Union to fully realise one of his passion projects. Set in early 1900s Siberia, Dersu Uzala covers the journey of two men from different backgrounds who meet during a surveying expedition and forge a close bond while battling the elemental forces in the midst of the harsh frontier.Also co-written by Kurosawa, the film is about man, nature, friendship & clashing of different lifestyles and addresses it through the exploits of its dual characters. Kurosawa offers ample space for their relationship to breathe & grow and films the Russian far east wilderness in awe-inspiring detail. Shot in 70mm, the photography is absolutely spellbinding to look at and effortlessly enraptures the senses.The picture however lacks the gripping quality of the director's best-known works and unfolds at too relaxed a pace which in turn makes its 144 mins runtime feel overlong. While the drama is far from tedious, the slow patches & occasional stillness do bother at times. Yury Solomin & Maxim Munzuk play the Russian explorer & titular trapper respectively with sincerity and their bonding not only feels genuine but also earned.Overall, Dersu Uzala is another diligently crafted feature from the Japanese auteur and is as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking. Its emotional grip on viewers may vary but the technical craftsmanship on display remains impressive throughout. A gorgeous addition to Kurosawa's rich & resonant body of work, this Soviet-Japanese production may pale in comparison to his greatest efforts but it is nonetheless worthy of a broader viewership.",6,dersu-uzala

After all, it’s got what may just be one of the most charming lead performances I think I’ve ever seen, helmed by Giuletta Masina in a charismatic display of human acting that whisks you along almost effortlessly. Her chaotic yet skillfully controlled energy is joyous to witness; her vivaciousness is as authentic as ever, seeping through the screen in contagious quantities. It’s her unbridled likability that ultimately makes the movie – specifically, the stark ending – such an emotional experience, her performance giving the final moments that painful edge yet at the same time that skillful, contained burst of hope. But aside from that, I struggled to care about the plot at hand, Masina’s charisma not standing as quite enough to cover up what I’d otherwise deem as fairly poor storytelling. Though on paper the delivery and very concept of the themes appear attractive, I never found Nights of Cabiria to be quite engaging, and though this will surely warrant anger from some people, it often feels overly aimless. Of course, it is a slice-of-life film, but it almost takes this a step too far, its middle stretch coming off as bloated and painfully meandering, only spiced up by Masina’s occasional bursts of comedic wit. Again, that ending leaves a powerful taste in your mouth, but it exists in what is otherwise a relatively dull film, that I just overall struggled to find interesting.

51478,"Rocco and His Brothers is a touchstone in European cinema. It also clearly influenced American films like Raging Bull and The Godfather. Drawing on neorealism, the film presents the economic migration of five brothers who leave the south of Italy to seek a better life in Milan. Regardless of its cinematic value, Rocco and His Brothers is worthwhile just for its showcase of working class life in such a specific time and place. It is also an epic for this kind of film, clocking in at around three hours. The brothers face different situations, with some finding happiness and others not. Family and romance are the central strands of the story however. Not all the brothers are good people, and one of them, Simone, rapes a woman in a particularly unpleasant scene. Rocco seeks to absolve his brother of his crimes, and part of the tragedy of Rocco and His Brothers is that there is so much needless sacrifice to help Simone. The younger brothers learn from the mistakes of Rocco and Simone, hoping the gradual economic transformation in Italy will create a better life for those who grow up in the future. Rocco and His Brothers is a complex, large film of turmoil within a family. It is completed by wonderful cinematography and a cast of great performers.

You can throw as many ""emotional"" moments at us as you like but it needs to have some kind of structure.- While some directorial choices are interesting I did find much of Mommy indulgent, scenes like Steve spinning a shopping cart around whilst Colorblind blasts in the background didn't add a single thing to his character we didn't already know.- If Boyhood's 12 year production period is considered a gimmick then so is this 1:1 aspect ratio.- What bugs me about the aspect ratio is that it never added anything to the film. Once I adjusted to it after about ten minutes the ""claustrophobic"" effect it had was kind of lost and it just wound up feeling like I was watching a movie on my cell phone. - Even Dolan seems to realize doing the 1:1 ration isn't effective unless it's offset by the occasional widening of the screen. What bugs me is that when the cinematography widened both times, it was like getting a slap in the face saying ""this is the happy moment, enjoy it while it lasts"". - The music choices just killed me. Dido's white flag? good song, terrible choice for the scene. Don't even get me started on that laughable Wonderwall montage holy crap. - While this movie has some incredibly strong acting, the movie winds up feeling like a pinball machine. lots of kinetics, flashing lights, sensory response, but then when you run out of quarters you realize the only attainable goal here is a high score of how many emotional scenes can I fit in?- To take a page from This is Spinal Tap, Dolan likes to go to 11. The problem is when your base level is 11 the maximum gets raised to a 15. All the emotional ""acting moments"" don't do well without something to juxtapose them with. In fact I think the film works best when Dolan slows things down and focuses on a bit of normal dialogue. - Did Steve really learn anything by the end of the film? for me he seemed like the same kid from the beginning which left me feeling hollow. Basically we are introduced to the characters, we watch them collide or converge, then we find up back where we started.- I never quite understood why Kyla was so invested in these people. Her character never seemed to get much deeper than a kindly neighbor.- I think the film says less about mother/son relationships and more about the current state of how we treat mentally ill people.- The fact that Dolan had to slap on an imaginary law in the beginning to make this premise work sent up a red flag to me immediately. - There is a good, probably even great film, buried here, but I don't think Dolan has the restraint required to pull it off. - I give Dolan credit for being so presumably autobiographical, but where someone Jonas Mekas can display his soul on film in different regards, Dolan seems content to just tell us what we should think here. We get he has Mommy issues, I think it would be interesting to see a film where that more subtle. - I wholeheartedly believe Dolan is capable of great things. People seem quick to praise him for his age when he's more a product of luck and happenstance. Once he makes some truly amazing pictures I think these early films of his will be regarded much more harshly. - I'm always open to new interpretations so if you want to try and change my mind have at it!",4,mommy-2014
18522,"Yes! Finally! I finally found a Wong Kar-wai film that I enjoy! Previously, Wong was basically 0-3 for me, as I didn't care much for Happy Together, I found Chungking Express ""ok"" but a huge disappointment given the praise, and 2046 didn't elicit enough interest for me to finish (though, to be fair, I only vaguely remember this experience and actually want to try again at some point).Thus, I went into this with tempered expectations and...I kinda love it. I was hooked from beginning to end. I was smiling and bursting with excitement due to appreciating how well it was executed.To call In The Mood For Love an ""understated love story"" is an understatement. It thrives in its depiction of restrained yearning. It revels in its portrait of unuttered-yet-conspicuous desires. Thanks to Tony Leung (Chow) and Maggie Cheung's (Su) performances and on-screen chemistry elevating the material, Chow and Su's longing and escalating affection and compounded agony is made palpable to the point that we can read their every unspoken thought, we can feel their every unexpressed impulse...and we can hear their heart struggle against the torture that they both endure.The portrayal of Su and Chow's mutual heartbreak, and how its compounded by their budding feelings for each other, and how these strong emotions conflict with their principles, and how they exist within a specific cultural context wherein their relationship (even unconsummated) is frowned upon by social mores...it's absorbing to say the least.Two quick random things:1️⃣- I really loved Su and Chow's therapeutic ""rehearsals"" - I found that addition to their bonding, coping, and shared ambiguous loss processing ingenious.2️⃣- Wong really loves assaulting the senses of the audience by repeating the same songs over and over and over again! It's ok since it really worked for me here, but I hated how I felt like I was being bludgeoned to death when he did this in Chungking Express. (I still can't listen to the Mamas and the Papas to this day. 😆)Admittedly, it didn't all work for me, but what did work overshadows the few minor issues that I had towards the end that aren't worth mentioning here. I know many people go gaga over this film and consider it ""The Greatest Thing Ever"" - it's far from that to me personally, but I do think that it's great and appreciate much of what it offers.I'm not ready to call myself a Wong Kar-wai fan just yet, but In the Mood for Love has me in the mood to reconsider my hesitation to further explore his filmography...🌟Why I Love East Asian Cinema🌟",7,in-the-mood-for-love

24938,"‘Sherlock Jr.’ exceeded my expectations in every way imaginable. While I anticipated Buster Keaton's brilliance, having seen ‘The General,’ I was pleasantly surprised by how well the film held up. The story is compelling, and the special effects are astonishingly advanced for their time. The concept of a movie within a movie is executed flawlessly, adding layers of depth and creativity to the narrative. Moreover, the acting was much more natural and engaging than I had expected from a silent film era piece. Keaton's expressions and his perfectly timed sequences are simply impeccable.The film's brevity is one of its strengths, clocking in at a lean 45 minutes, ensuring every moment is packed with precision and purpose. Keaton's inventive sequences and comedic timing create a seamless flow that keeps the audience captivated from start to finish. His ability to demolish the fourth wall and use the metaphorical bricks to build a magic castle is a testament to his visionary talent. The special effects and trick shots are so seamless that they stand apart from the entire history of cinematic shots, even by today's standards. It's incredible how these elements combine to make a film that is not only entertaining but also groundbreaking in its execution.I’m very much now excited to delve into more of Keaton's work. The film brilliantly showcases why there's a fan-boy rivalry between Keaton and Chaplin, as both brought something uniquely magnificent to the world of cinema. ‘Sherlock Jr.’ proves that Keaton's contributions were not just about humour, but about pushing the boundaries of what film could achieve. The fact even that Buster Keaton broke his neck in the water pipe scene of proves his dedication to filmmaking. It's a film that stays with you, lingering long after the credits roll, ensuring you don’t forget it after a few minutes. Keaton's legacy as a great filmmaker is firmly cemented with this masterpiece. 4/5.",7,sherlock-jr

23504,"This film is such a unique experience. Who would have thought a film where the main character doesn't leave his apartment would be good, let alone great? Leave it up to Alfred Hitchcock I guess.  In fact one of the most interesting parts of the film is that it is shot from one apartment. It gives such a different perspective.The performances from James Stewart and Grace Kelly are engrossing and I ended up rooting for both of them in the end. Despite Mr Jefferies doing his best to keep everybody at a distance with his quips and overall bitterness. But you have to sympathise with him because of his current predicament. The story is absolutely fascinating and I was genuinely interested to find out what was going on all over his neighbourhood. There are so many stand-moments in the film for me, from the intense scene in Thorwald's apartment to the inevitable last shot of Mr Jefferies 2 broken legs. My favourite moment is the scene where everybody finds out that poor dog dies. The woman gives such a rousing speech that certainly touched me and I thought everybody else was touched by, yet as soon as she finished they all continued with what they were doing as if nothing had even happened. More likely they were complaining about how much of a commotion she had made over a dog. This film was an introduction to Hitchcock's work for me and I think we will get along just fine. My grandad, the person who got me into film in the first place, says that he finds Hitchcock hit and miss. Well, in my case, this film was certainly a hit.If you have any suggestions on what Hitchcock film I should watch next then please let me know.",8,rear-window

66314,"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a 2004 American science fiction drama film written by Charlie Kaufman, directed by Michel Gondry and stars Jim Carrey, Kate Winslet in the leading roles alongside Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood in supporting roles. At its core this could have easily been just another love story moulded into a psychedelic formula but it’s unique premise and flawless acting makes it standout above many early 2000s films. Eternal Sunshine is one of the most intelligent romantic dramas around, Kaufman’s script works incredibly well at creating a tense atmosphere filled with rather somber emotions throughout. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is one of the more puzzling films I’ve had the task of reviewing. Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry both work terrifically well at creating a world you want to dive deeper into and see more stories like this. If you delve deeper into the film you’ll realise that it portrays the message that relationships are never perfect, they’re clumsy, strange and emotionally draining at times. Yet, if you manage to get through it all, you’ll find it can also be some of the best experiences of your life and that’s what this film is trying to convey. Joel and Clementine’s (Jim Carrey & Kate Winslet)  relationship is a turbulent one, in fact so turbulent that they want to delete each other from their memories. However, as you delve deeper into their memories you quickly realise that despite their bitterness, they also hold a great deal of good memories that he wants to keep.  Now, I won’t try and mass interpret the films meaning as honestly, it confused me quite a bit but I will say that ultimately the general understanding that I have of it still made it quite a brilliant first watch for me. Both performances from Jim and Kate were phenomenal to watch and the side performances from Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo and creepy Elijah Wood worked incredibly well as well. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a fantastic film with it’s raw emotional power, incredible script and great cinematography all working an absolutely charm. However, the film did leave me slightly underwhelmed on my first viewing, yet it definitely feels like a film that would improve on a rewatch. All in all, whilst some of it ultimately underwhelmed me, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a fantastic film and has to be one of Kaufman’s best. What’s your favourite Charlie Kaufman film?4/5",7,eternal-sunshine-of-the-spotless-mind

His most recent outing as his beloved bumbling vagrant the Tramp, Modern Times, had been one of the top grossing films that year, but as a mostly silent picture that only used synchronised sound sparingly it was dramatically out of step with the influx of sound pictures. Worse, he’d received criticism for his incorporation of social commentary into what was otherwise a comedy—a rather pressing concern given that his new project was set to tackle the rise of fascism during World War II.

The Vichy government has signed an armistice with Nazi Germany, and the independent state is at peace, yet within the hearts of its people rages a fire of indignation. Enemy soldiers and the French police roam the city streets, rifling through bags and throwing anyone and everyone—people of every race, ideology and disposition—in prison. Most never make it back home. Watching the SS jubilantly march through the Arc de Triomphe, I immediately realized the eponymous fighting force didn't refer to the invaders, who proudly run roughshod over their conquered neighbors, but instead to the underbelly of the revolution. That opening image, I imagine, must have pissed off every French viewer who saw this in '69, just as much as I imagine it pisses off every character in the film. It is a flagrant violation, painting fascist subjugation directly over France's most potent symbol of liberty. But if you know your history, you also know the Arc honors those who died for the Revolution. Beneath it rests The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a symbol of armistice and the unidentified dead. This monument represents the quest for freedom and peace, as well as the horrible price it often demands. Seeing this military tromp on this ground is enough to put you off your rationed bread and cheese.Army of Shadows is widely, and correctly, considered Melville's peak. Here, he interrogates what praxis is after the profane has annihilated the sacred. In a topsy-turvy world where sovereignty is in name only, where the system turns against its people, against all people, what do you do? What ideals do you cling to? In one sense, the goal is to survive, yet each member of the French Resistance knows the true cost of participation. When they stuff you in the back of that police van, one's own life takes a backseat to the cause. And unlike the heroes of the Napoleonic Wars, no one is likely to remember how you struggled. These brave women and men live their life by a code, as all Melville characters, honor bound to cause as much goddamn trouble as they can. They're undermanned, outgunned, desperate and afraid, navigating impossible odds that test their mettle and their integrity. The film's beautiful portrait of solidarity complements the grim truth of history. The unified Europe of the modern day was paid for in blood, in this case by those ready to answer that call. The film is all about the nobility of their disobedience, the inhuman temerity it takes to alter the course of history, piece by piece, operation by operation, body by body. Their sacrifice and their lives help us to remember resistance is never futile.Jean-Pierre Melville Ranked",9,army-of-shadows

The film serves as a multifaceted tribute to the evolution and artistry of Japanese cinema, spotlighting the stylistic and thematic richness that has enthralled audiences over the years.Central to the narrative is the character of Chiyoko, whose life story embodies a profound exploration of the themes of resilience, determination, and the pursuit of dreams. Her journey, marked by both challenge and perseverance, offers a nuanced portrayal of womanhood and the relentless drive toward achieving one's goals, irrespective of the obstacles encountered.Directed by Satoshi Kon, Millennium Actress stands out for its inventive storytelling approach and the seamless integration of animation to blur the boundaries between reality and imagination. The film invites us to engage with a narrative that oscillates between the tangible and the fantastical, encouraging a reflection on the nature of truth and the creative process.The overarching narrative, framed by Chiyoko's search for a mysterious figure from her past, evolves into a metaphorical exploration of human desires, aspirations, and the intrinsic value found in the journey itself, rather than its destination. The film suggests that it is the passion and dedication we invest in our pursuits that lend our lives meaning and substance, presenting a reflective take on the pursuit of fulfillment and purpose.In essence, Millennium Actress celebrates the legacy of Japanese cinema while simultaneously delving into universal themes of ambition, identity, and the human condition through the lens of its richly drawn protagonist.Satoshi Kon ranked",6,millennium-actress

Outside of Apu himself, there's almost nothing at this point to tie this film to previous films aside from his own occasional references to his life, and considering we see a very different side of him here than we saw in Pather Panchali or Aparajito, and considering how he's played by a different actor, it almost seems like Apu is a legacy character at this point.

10931,"For whatever reason, I had always thought Paths of Glory was like three hours long, but no, leave it to Kubrick to deliver one of the most harrowing meat-grinder battle sequences, one of cinema’s most hatable and morally repugnant characters, and an infuriating, scathing, crushing indictment of war and the callous higher-ups who see men on the frontline as mere rungs to further their personal career ascension…all in 88 arresting minutes.It’s a dense film but never feels rushed; pacing, plotting, dialogue, characterizations, every facet meticulously honed to be effective and dramatically gripping while always driving the story forward. The trench warfare segment is cursed by moral unease from the start, precisely escalating in personal conflict and dreadful tension until erupting into an unrelenting surge of death during the suicidal charge across no man’s land. In a half hour, Kubrick captures the carnage, command dysfunction, and claustrophobic terror of WW1’s battlegrounds better than some entire films. Thus it speaks volumes about how infuriating, scathing, and captivating the subsequent military tribunal is, that the political onslaught feels even merciless than the frontline’s bullets. In a way, the poor souls chosen as scapegoats face two firing squads, only the first is a fusillade of callous disdain rather than of lead while the men are hopelessly restrained by kangaroo court injustice. Whether dismissing shell shock, causally tallying the potential causalities of an impossible objective, dismissing any and all battlefield realities in favor of seeing disobedience from cowardly scum, or lounging on a gilded couch during the trial, George Macready’s General Mireau radiates sickeningly smug vileness. Adolphe Menjou’s Broulard is no better, maybe even worse with his facade of grandfatherly smile and his sociopathic sacrifice of troops in the misguided name of morale. Evil has rarely seemed so comfortably banal, utterly incapable of understanding sincere righteousness.Kirk Douglas’ Colonel Dax becomes more than a compelling good man, but our anchor of dignity and duty amid an ocean of cruel ambition, a bravely irritating stone in the midst of other men’s paths to glory. Yet for all his sly maneuvers and seething outrage, Dax can only ever be a cog. Kubrick wrings that sense of futile inevitability for all its tragic worth.

I’m so happy for him. There’s about 45ish minutes of Oppenheimer that fire on all cylinders, mostly leading up to them (spoilers) testing the atomic bomb. The rest of the flick ranges from okay-i-guess to bafflingly incompetent, just full of “ripped from the NYT best-seller biography” type dialogue and audaciously stupid creative gambits that range from maudlin and uninspired to genuinely funny like how Tommy Wiseau’s The Room is funny. Multiple scenes where I full-on LOL’d, like belly laugh, couldn’t contain it, including such blunders as titties out Florence Pugh asking Oppy to read the Sanskrit passage that contains the “I am become shiva god of death the destroyer of worlds” post coitus long before the manhattan project is a glimmer in anyone’s eye; The Nick Sucinek 45-minute SOV trash horror level of bad liquid latex skin flaking off of a girl while Oppy hallucinates; Oppy stepping in the ashes of a baby while he hallucinates; Oppy wife hallucinating Florence Pugh and Oppy fucking in the hearing room as Jason Clarke (another amazing performance) forces Oppy to admit on the record that he cheated on Oppy Wife (literally the funniest single scene at the movies so far this year); Marvel Movie style JFK name drop; every time Einstein showed up.

32896,"Presenting Andrei Tarkovsky in total self-indulgent mode, Mirror is an experimental art-house feature that unfolds like a vignette of dreams, memories & consciousness, all mashed together & arranged in fragmented bits with no defined structure, pattern or continuity. It is an enigma that defies logic & understanding, discards all established conventions, and is impossible to decrypt with the same set of tools we use for most cinematic works.Co-written & directed by Tarkovsky (Andrei Rublev & Solaris), this autobiographical sketch is best described as a half-remembered dream that's free-flowing & limitless in ways thoughts & sensations often tend to be and incorporates elements from the Soviet filmmaker's own childhood & upbringing for its imagery. The passage has no uniformity as it switches from past to present and changes from colour to black-n-white with absolute randomness.The film depicts the key moments in the life of a dying poet in pre-war, war-time & post-war Russia which at times intersect with vital events in Russian history that's shown in newsreel footage. Dreams & memories are accompanied by poems that are recited in a lifeless manner while the cast tries to render their respective roles with care & commitment. Still, the only aspect that helped me steer past the finish line is the film's sublime & ethereal camerawork.Overall, Mirror is nigh impenetrable & incomprehensible and is the most challenging film in Andrei Tarkovsky's body of work but there is an elegiac sadness to it that also makes it his most personal effort. Not an easy film to decipher in a single sitting, this art piece is an attempt by the famous Soviet auteur to utilise the filmmaking medium as a visual language instead of a storytelling canvas. And while I'm sure there is an audience for films like these, I'm also certain that I'm not part of it.",2,mirror

87042,"It took me a while to get absorbed by PERFECT DAYS but I must say, it was refreshing to see how powerful the final act was. It had made up for some of the shortcomings of the 2nd act of the film in my opinion. My positive star rating will mostly be based on that final 10 minutes of the film.This is Wenders doing Ozu. This is his attempt at the Paterson and Jeanne Dielman styles of storytelling and the film begins at a disadvantage for me because I don't like either of these films which it takes inspiration from. I usually dislike films about the mundanity of every day life where someone from the working class or right on the poverty line faces some sort of life changing bit of news or life changing epiphany. It's among the most basic type of movies and probably the scripts I read the most often while doing coverage services and they're never as profound as they think they are. I read 5 of these a month at least lol and they're always the damn same lol.I wonder how ineffective the film would be without some of these needle drops. The music is really carrying a lot of the emotion of some scenes and honestly, it feels manipulative at times. Of course I'll be invested and rocking out to like 4 of my favorite songs of all time even if what's happening on screen isn't as heavy as suggested. It's such a cheat code and slightly lazy to bank such cinematic moments resting their weight on the shoulders of banger tunes.Didn't like much of the supporting cast, which is a similar problem that Paterson and Jeanne Dielman have. The main character is interesting (enough but also barely) so that when you get these terrible characters and terrible actors in supporting roles, it's almost ruining the flow of the serenity presented in the film. That coworker character Takashi is like the Jar Jar Binks of the movie. He played things in a comedic, slapstick, over the top way and his few scenes really ruined the vibe of the film for me. Genuinely seems that he either thought he was acting in a Dana Harvey comedy or he's just an abysmal actor who can't take direction.What the film did really well, was manage a state of fluidity in editing and lucidity in the incorporation of dream sequences. The use of black and white was quite powerful here. Also, the use of colors has been lingering in my head since I watched it honestly so I bumped it up a half point. There's still some movie magic here on display. The final act, as I mentioned before, is pretty powerful and there are some confident creative decisions at play. I think back on many shots in this film as being pretty memorable. Unfortunately, the repetitiveness of the plot, the disingenuous characters and even more disingenuous representation of the middle class just unfortunately made me feel like a bit detached to this compared to everyone else. I've heard people say this is Wenders best, or a 2023 best and I just wasn't feeling that at any time throughout this.I should say though that even if it takes inspiration from Paterson and Jeanne Dielman and has a disadvantage based on my personal tastes, it may actually be better and have left more of an impression on me than those two films.",5,perfect-days-2023

49512,"🧋🧋🧋🧋🧋/10For a film that preaches about kindness and love, people who defend Everything Everywhere All at Once to the ends of the earth have been far from kind. We’re in a decade now where people can call you a “race traitor” just for being an Asian person who is critical about tokenistic, fetishised representation of Asians in film and TV. It’s so clear to me that the Daniels has made Asian identity palatable to both white audiences and Asians whose identities are adjacent to whiteness — however, I’ve seen dear friends of the diaspora love this film for what it is. So how do I best approach my criticisms without invalidating the experiences of other people?For now, let me exhaust every morsel of honesty out of my system. I want to make one thing clear to my white/non-Asian followers: this film is not and never will be emblematic of the entire Asian diasporic experience. EEAAO is a film predicated on boba liberal propaganda, dissolving the Chinese American experience into tokenistic Asian stereotypes about Asian tiger mothers, their soft husbands, their stubborn daughters, and intergenerational traumas. In a new decade where the Asian diaspora is finally speaking up about “breaking generational trauma,” Hollywood seems to have offered up a quick-fix solution in the form of quirky, absurdist films about coping with helicopter parenting and forcing immigrant parents to assimilate into liberalism, without contextualising collectivism and its roots in Eastern thought. First it’s Turning Red. Now it is the Daniels. This solution is not only liberal, but it is also deeply neoliberal. Once you think about it, you realise that such films are the cinematic equivalent of a self-help book; millennials hear rave reviews about something, and they willingly throw money at it, mistaking the fleeting moment of security and affirmation as a quick and easy fix to all their problems.The truth is: there is no quick and easy fix to generational traumas. It differs from person to person, from circumstance to circumstance, culture to culture. Cinema has the capacity to validate your experiences, and for those who felt seen with this, I won’t hold it against you. However, for me, I refuse to fall into Hollywood’s spellbinding, commercial trap of having my problems seen and advertised into shallow multiverses. I also refuse to have Hollywood profit off my issues either — it’s hard enough living in a capitalist realism state that seeks to privatise mental health. It seems that bagels, buttplugs, and hotdog fingers are like the present-day essential oils and Kmart crystals that are emblematic of spiritual/emotional bypassing. This film tells you to be kind, let go, and spread love; yet I’ve seen people who’ve become hostile over others who either hated this film or offer valid criticisms. Anyone who decides to insult me with ad hominems in the comments will simply prove my point about this film’s ephemeral burst of enlightenment.As much as it is about a working-class Chinese American family life, the Daniels do very little to interrogate the distinctions between diaspora and homeland. There’s Chinese New Year and Mandarin, but that’s really where it stops. There’s little context behind why older Chinese ancestors cannot open themselves up to queerness — which this article does, by highlighting the ways in which the country’s nationalism is rooted in societal reproduction and patriarchy. Eastern countries have their own issues with collectivism and nationalism — so why can’t Western countries admit to their own blemishes with liberalism and individualism? I guess it’s because it stays committed to its own nihilism about how nothing matters. East and West no longer matters, the same way Chinese identity doesn’t matter for the sake of pan-Asian appeal and so-called Asian representation.On a substance level, this film felt more closely akin to a YouTube Original film — which I guess has its charm, especially if you grew up with webseries by the likes of Dr Horrible or Video Game High School. Much of the credit goes to the manic editing and larger-than-life production level, but I’m aware that it’s the Daniels’ cosmetic way of painting liberalism as progressive and oh-so pretty. The yellow subtitles remind me of SBS Movies, and I liked that. But that’s about it. I don’t know what else is there to say — all the good has been said, and all the bad has been said. Beyond the Asian cast, I wasn’t too sure how this film was any different from its predecessors; the contemporaries being Marvel films and Rick and Morty……is it the diet Wong Kar-Wai homage? Yeah, nah I won’t get started on that.Maybe the multiverse narrative is unique when it hinges on an Asian American family, because tokenising Asian identities is like some new innovative tool? Hmm…Above everything else, EEAAO has been an exercise in spectatorship. I was tempted to end this review with “all my Asian friends who loved EEAAO need to let go of their Western biases.” But it’s not that easy lol. On one hand, there are those who did not feel represented by the Daniels’ blatant boba liberalism and tokenistic depictions of Asianness by way of tropes and stereotyping. But on the other hand, I know Asian friends who connected with this work; friends who are as critical of boba liberalism as I am; friends who are queer and struggle with living under circumstances that are far from ideal; friends who are deeply connected to their Asian culture and their homeland; friends who see Asian identity beyond its tokenism. So in all my criticisms, is it right for me to invalidate their experience? Is it right for me to tell them that they shouldn’t love this work? That it’s wrong for them to identify with such tokenistic displays of Asianness? That they’re not allowed to give money to such (neo)liberal works of film? That they’re blind to the stereotypes? That loving this film would make them a hypocrite?It’s a hard question to answer. My friends’ love for EEAAO are just as valid as those who criticise the film. The fact that I reflect more on this film’s boba liberalism than its narrative and formalism is rather telling of where I sit with this film. I really do want the best in Asian representation; it’s difficult to imagine Michelle Yeoh’s stage direction as nothing more than “act like a typical Asian mum.” I’m worried for this new age of accented cinema that is increasingly neoliberal and tokenistic. Again, I won’t hold it against anyone who connected deeply with this film, but sadly I just can’t see it speaking for myself. If anyone still doesn’t understand where I’m coming from, please refer to all the reviews written by other race traitors (charot) who gave it <2.5 stars.Shout out to [REDACTED] on Discord for dropping this film in the catalogues.",4,everything-everywhere-all-at-once

29911,"Recommended by FilmEnthusiast3Ever since I’ve been getting requests from some of my online friends on here to watch Bresson’s filmography, so I caved in and got the criterion blu-ray to finally watch it. I have to say, this is the perfect introduction to getting into his filmography. “(8) For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is the gift of God, (9) not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” - Ephesians 2:8-9What I find fascinating about this film is how it uses Christianity respectfully and sparingly. The main idea isn’t just about a man escaping prison, it’s about having faith in God through hard times. Fontaine will do anything to break out of prison, but doing it by himself isn’t going to be easy. Because of his faith in Christ, he has given Fontaine neighbors for help, items that would be transformed into useful tools for escape, and a change of heart that values humanity. So, the only true way to escape is to have faith. It’s a simple yet powerful way of telling a story of spirituality and humanity. As for the rest of the film, it’s an impressive piece of filmmaking. It’s all thanks to the brilliant use of camerawork, sound design, atmosphere and tension. They play a huge role for building the story and conflict from start to finish. A Man Escaped is one of those movies that will glue you to the screen the entire time. It’s a smart and tightly written film that is packed with its quiet atmosphere, gripping tension, and captivating themes. I can’t wait to check out more from Robert Bresson and how he continues to explore Christianity.",8,a-man-escaped

47786,"Though it didn’t fully work for me, I was in awe of so much of this film. I just adore how epic, melodramatic and (sorry for a lack of originality) operatic it was.Lu Wei, Lillian Lee and Chen Kaige’s decision to blur the lines between literal and performance, as well as self and character, in the film was an inspired one. The incredibly melodramatic dialogue was spectacular, as was the gorgeous music and cinematography, and many of the performative scenes taking place off the stage really steal this film.Chen Kaige’s own personal experiences are so intensely palpable in this film, making this film’s haunting depiction of The Cultural Revolution all the more powerful, given the director’s own regrets and horror are so tangible here.Of course this would all fall flat if the characters of ‘Farewell My Concubine’ weren’t so strong. Leslie Cheung, Zhang Fengyi and Gong Li all give brilliant and intensely human performances here which make their characters’ tragedies all the more heartbreaking. Cheung especially excels with his physical performance given that most of his dialogue is quite clearly dubbed.Normally, I’m not too fond of these types of love triangles, but I think it really works here with how melodramatic the storytelling is, as well as how the tension affects their professional lives and not just their personal lives. Its an emotional rollercoaster witnessing the peaks and troughs of Xiaodouzi and Xiaolou’s troupe as both personal and historical turmoil affects their livelihoods and artistic passions, as well as witnessing the breakdown of their personal and professional relationship once Juxian enters the film. Some of the emotional lows this film explores are quite intense and I wouldn’t blame someone for not being able to stomach it, so be warned of abuse and self-abuse before going in.I’m genuinely sad I can’t bring myself to give this film a higher rating because most of this film is simply phenomenal. Unfortunately, it’s a tad too long and drags in too many portions for it to warrant anything higher. Still, I highly recommend this, it’s a brilliant film.",6,farewell-my-concubine

8074,"My thoughts on Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion (watched after ep24)…“God knows I'm not perfect, either. I've made tons of stupid mistakes, and later I regretted them. And I've done it over and over again, thousands of times; a cycle of hollow joy and vicious self-hatred. But even so, every time I learned something about myself. Please Shinji, you've got to pilot the EVA and settle this once and for all... for your own sake. Find out why you came here; why you exist at all! Answer your own questions. And when you've found your answers, come back to me. I'll be waiting for you.”Thought-provoking, poignant, profound, visceral and an unparalleled film that has an incomprehensible amount of substance that withholds a flawless, perfected narrative that possesses every emotion and expands on them to construct unrivalled relationships between the audience and the characters as well as presenting almost three-dimensional relationships between each character; they are all fleshed out to their furthest extent as well as being flooded with vehement emotion, motives and every character just encompasses a state of feeling or want, whether it’s to escape self-imposed prisons that restraint all psychological and cognitive freedom or whether it’s overcoming grief while simultaneously attempting to have the ability to express affection once again. Although there is no definitive answer to any of these eccentric sequences which are often accompanied by outlandish imagery or insightful dialogue, I still perceive this as one of, if not the greatest endings and overall best films I have witnessed because it’s not just a 2D, straightforward narrative which follows a saturated, formulaic narrative, instead it’s a revolutionary and far beyond it’s time depiction of time and reality otherwise known as the “instrumentality project” that is the embodiment of complex especially with the way it’s conveyed but the fluidity and the build up from the start of the series to the ending of the film just grants an unprecedented atmosphere and experience with it almost instantaneously granting you your personal perception and feelings towards every aspect, all the way to the minuscule details which I found to be insanely clever as it almost contradicts the entirety of the “instrumentality project”.Best overall characters in any media, as previously mentioned, each character personifies a certain or even multiple characteristics and motives that are present throughout but my reasoning for this show and film having the best characters (in my opinion) is because it doesn’t prioritise/singularly hone in on that particular “thing” about the character, instead it prioritises the establishment of their character’s personality and their motives, it is then we get to see their distinctive characteristics through quintessential dialogue and imagery. I also found the subtle yet emphatic at times, enigmatic nature to be perfectly depicted due to it forcing the audience to really reflect on who’s right and wrong, why and how and everything about this enigmatic approach assembles a realistic and impactful viewing experience, and this ambiguousness is accentuated impeccably.This is probably my favourite art style within any animated film/show because it gives off something nothing else has not because it’s objectively better than anything else, its because it just has that ‘cool’ feeling surrounding it, nothing more nothing less, just makes everything slightly more enjoyable and captivating, especially when it comes to those unmatched EVA fight sequences.THEORY (INCLUDES MINOR SPOILERS):The continuous shifts between reality and just a figment of reality has an ethereal yet distinctive feeling; it’s done in a way that is exceedingly clever in which each sequence from both the series and film could be a figment/self-altered perception of life fabricated by Shinji to escape the confrontation and the pain of words, practically victimising himself and thereby hurting everyone around him; they’re perceiving him as a heartless, objectifying man who only cares about his priorities (which could be a parallel to his father) but also it could be reality and everything the audience saw was authentic pain. It’s just crazy to me that my theory is just a fraction of what could slightly correlate to what the writer/director intended.——————————————————————————There is a copious amount of thing’s I could talk about and how it is genuinely perfect but that would take an exhausting amount of time, just watch the show and the film because it offers everything, everything else can’t, the show is perfect and the film is the perfect conclusion, can’t wait to see the alternative ending from ep25 and ep26.",8,neon-genesis-evangelion-the-end-of-evangelion
27090,"A film that explores how a bond between two people is something that can never be completely rationalised no matter how much you try. This film is primarily a collection of different scenes that focus on one specific idea. Their relationship and how they try to understand it. It’s difficult to see this as a film that makes you instantly want to call it a masterpiece, but instead requires you to digest the ideas explored in its rich dialogue, expressions and even the things left unsaid. I wonder if the film version suffers from its categorical and widely spaced storytelling or if it’s for a deliberate effect. I think it’s definitely effective having these characters meet over extended periods of short time time and hearing how their unexplainable and inseparable bond keeps drawing them together. I believe that by the end they come to accept that they cannot rationalise their connection, as well as truly understand what love is. Maybe Bergman is saying that love is sent, gifted and reciprocated in different forms and cannot be simplified into a single form, and trying to do so can be damaging to relationships and what we believe to be genuine. I think that when I become older I’ll understand this more from a relatable perspective, but it’s depth and detail and precision fascinated me throughout the whole 3 hours.",8,scenes-from-a-marriage

71994,"I loved the first twenty-two minutes of A Matter of Life and Death with all of my heart. The aggressive unreality of the doomed plane, and its pilot spouting poetry because he can finally let go of everything else. The airmen in a modernist other world, with their new wings under their arms, carefully wrapped in dry cleaners' bags. The long, empty beach, interrupted only by a line of clothes. The joyous, impossible reunion.The rest of it, however, gradually lost me as it progressed. I recognize that I am the problem here, but it's very, very difficult for me to care about dreamy, one-in-a-million romances that rearrange heaven and earth because they're so dang pure and perfect (this is also my issue with the very few Marcel Carné films that don't work for me). It all just strikes me as silly, and the courtroom scenes here are similarly so, with the endless rows full of identical types, the ham-fisted celebration of American diversity, and the exhausting, empty argument about whose freedom is better and more real. Intellectually, I understand that this is all — perhaps — happening inside the head of a dying man, who is — maybe — creating arguments for and against his own survival, hinging upon his newfound love for a pretty girl he barely knows. But that awareness doesn't make it any more interesting (to me), or any less syrupy and grating (to me).All that said, I very much enjoyed the few shots of Roger Livesey with his hands in his pockets, lawyering, and am tickled by the way we are, as a species, seemingly incapable of creating an afterlife not rooted in bureaucracy.",4,a-matter-of-life-and-death

38793,"A friend of mine once said:“Films are a joy. There’s no such thing as too many films.”Or something along those lines. Main point: films are a joy. Yes, they are. Ideal films are great pieces of ebullience, and that even includes movies that touch upon serious drama that can leave viewers with not a strong feeling of sadness but a feeling of tenseness or a brooding comeuppance. But the film as a whole gives one something to think about and ponder over, and that can amount to joy. This son-of-b*tch movie on the other hand is something different. This is like Bicycle Thieves on acid. So we’ve got two jackass Frenchmen — one (Mario) treats his lover like garbage while the other guy (Jo) is a former big shot gangster who treats basically everyone like garbage. They now live in a South American town looking for work alongside the kind and happy Luigi, the quiet Bimba, and others. A new job offer comes their way: drive heavy trucks full of dangerous nitroglycerin across uneven, weak, and terrain changing roads. One mistake in keeping the delivery intact or balanced will cause the trucks to explode. Reward for successful delivery: $2,000.So that’s what makes this thriller quite exciting. Amidst the rivalry that develops between the two teams of men driving the trucks, the anticipation and hope for them to stay safe becomes the first priority over getting the money. Interestingly, you’d forget that Mario and Jo are two jackasses, and watch them become weak during the long journey and the fear that they might get themselves killed. Suddenly, a bit of sympathy takes over and you have a heart for who are essentially terrible people. And through the suspense is a light at the end of the tunnel. Clouzot executes this quite well, but that damn ending really put it all to waste, and was definitely coming right when The Blue Danube starts playing a bit forcefully as Mario’s driving back home and purposely swerving like a dumbass.So, was this film a joy? Not really. But as I think about it more at this very moment, the ending is almost kind of hilarious, and that’s because it felt like Clouzot wanted to screw with the audience: “Oh, so you guys want this guy to make it back home? You sort of have a heart for this dude, now? He made it through the hard and perilous journey, escaping death — he deserves to go back home and see his beautiful girl! Guess what, NOPE, he ain’t! Va te faire foutre!The ending just felt like let’s shock people for the sake of it. Maybe it’s either a lesson about how life is trepidatious and temperamental and depicts the lengths people take in order to make a living, added to the critiques on Americans in the sociopolitical field? Oh, Lord, that’s exhausting and tacky. Or once again, maybe Clouzot just wanted to screw with everyone. Yeah, I’ll take the latter, it’s pretty funny. Films are a joy. What is the second joy of this film? The fact that Mario was taller and skinnier than Luigi.",5,the-wages-of-fear

57640,"La Notte begins in a hospital where Giovanni and Lidia come face to face with the impending death of one of their friends. After Lidia leaves, Giovanni slips into the neighbouring room of a young psychiatric patient to steal an illicit kiss. This is a world of sex and death via a marriage heading for the rough. Theirs is an atrophied love, surviving only on tired routine and fused together by paralysis.Giovanni and Lidia are beautiful people slowly necrotising while the sweet life of money and beauty swirls around them. It’s like their style has suffocated their substance and they can no longer rely on the wild card of their youth to thrive. It’s as if their glamorous lives have metastasised, sickening them into exhaustion.In the film’s middle section, Lidia’s disaffection sees her leave their apartment and wander the streets of Milan. There’s a sexual charge to her elegance, walking alone in the poorer fringes of town. She is simultaneously drawn to and repulsed by a street fight. She distantly gazes on potent young men firing rockets into oblivion. Jeanne Moreau’s resting sad face is perfect in the role of the slightly older woman struggling to understand how she’s ended up on the outskirts of her own life.Both the form and the subject of Antonioni’s film is elegance. Its style amplifies the characters’ malaise. He locates their emotionless faces within modernist architecture, equally stripped of feeling. The film is relentlessly slow, but never dull or heavy; in fact I found it quite light of foot like the occasional dance scenes. The rhythm of La Notte glides from marital disappointment to catastrophic ennui where even the final section’s lavish party, filled with spirited jazz and laughter, finds Giovanni and Lidia withering on the bacchanalian vine. Their time in the sun has faded into the long and exhausting night.

18192,"''Mother Sister's always watching.''One of the film's most beloved scenes—the right-hand/left-hand love/hate scene—is almost word-for-word ripped from a film that came out 50 years prior.I don't really get what's so special here.The characters are all one-note, the story is contrived, and the script isn't multifaceted so much as it just makes the guys who're in the right say the N-word a few times toward the end so that the film can claim moral ambiguity. Sal is the biggest example of this, with his personality entirely changing from scene to scene, purely to set the stage for different interactions.Rather than being a developed character whose actions set in motion the film's events, he's a cipher who has either positive or negative traits depending on how Spike Lee wants a scene to play out.The scene playing Sal as creepy toward Mookie's sister is an especially egregious moment.I'm really failing to see what's so special here.This feels like it was the laziest, most self-defeating 'racial tensions lead to violence' movie out there until American History X came along to take that crown—and, much like that film, Do the Right Thing's ending isn't so much a nuanced exploration of the natural outcome of clashing prejudices so much as it's a morally self-defeating attempt at even handedness.If, as the credits rolled, you wondered if Mookie did the right thing, then I feel like you and I have some severe moral disconnect that I can't even begin to reconcile.It's a film where an Italian owned pizza place has italian heroes on its wall of fame, and that leads to a racially motivated harassment campaign against the owners that culminates in the police killing one of the harassers, and despite not calling the police—in fact being outwardly hostile to the police—the owner of the pizzeria is blamed for this and his restaurant is burned down in a race riot.I'm sorry if I don't think that becomes a nuanced narrative just because the guy says the N-word while arguing with one of the harassers in the last 30 minutes of the film.The only thing I really liked about this one, from a narrative perspective, was the Mother Sister and Da Mayor dynamic. Both interesting characters that, unfortunately,  aren't used for much more than window dressing.There are a few flashes of Spike Lee's immense visual talent here and there, especially in how effectively hot and oppressive the film is. And a few scenes—like the scene where the street light comes on, the scene where Sal is shouting out of the window, and the first scene with Smiley...—standout as decently pretty.Unfortunately, most of the film is the use of gimmicky closeups and dutch angles, which, over the film's runtime, gradually drifts toward being an offputtingly self-conscious attempt at 'arthouse' aesthetics. Still it's never ugly, and there are a couple flashes of genuine beauty sprinkled throughout.Plus the colour palette and costume design is great.It's not beautiful, but the visuals are fun.Do the Right Thing just isn't for me. It's essentially a prettily presented narrative video-essay, and that's not really what I want out of a movie.",2,do-the-right-thing

81171,"Film School Drop Outs Weekly ChallengeWeek 13: Editor - Daniel MandellTwenty minutes in and I knew I was watching one of the best films, by the time it beautifully (almost) wrapped one character's storyline. I was on the edge of my seat to see how it would transition to others, but most importantly, top that moment. There was no need to be fearful, it was perfect all around.Expertly handles the tough subject matter - veterans adjusting to the post-war world and subsequently changed relationships, as well as living with PTSD. The three veteran characters focused here representing three problems/experiences: loss/physical disability (by way of Harold Russell's Homer), unemployment (Dana Andrews' Fred), and unhealthy coping mechanism, in this case, alcoholism (Fredric March's Al Stephenson). Thoroughly explores the complexities of each individual situation, and comments on it as a whole; no character is two dimensional whether it's veterans or their families - you can understand everyone's point of views & where they are coming from. In that way, it feels naturalistic and authentic, while also somehow being light, entertaining and, at points, even humorous. Constantly reminding you of its based-in era yet having a timeless quality. Hitting all the emotional beats without being overpowering - imo, its best asset. A truly wonderfully written screenplay.The pacing is amazing, and the whole film just easily flows. It pulls you in and happily keeps you as an observer of events / the vital or best moments of their lives. The world created is so immersive. There's only one editing choice that stuck out: at 31 mins mark, wherein a band member at the bar was casually playing his guitar, seemingly having a good time, but as soon as the camera zoomed in on him, he gave a weird reaction as if he had been caught (off guard). Don't know if it was a deliberate decision by all on set, or they just decided to keep it later; but either ways, it makes for a really funny moment, and adds to the realism.This insight into their present, and now our past world, is given further life to by an incredible cast. There's just too many good performances to choose a favourite/stand out from, whether it's by the actors playing the veterans, or the Stephenson family ie Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright. The latter vaguely reminded me of Rachel Brosnahan/Miriam, uncanny. But I really loved March's;  honestly, might be in love with him now. Also, the fact that Homer is played by Russell, an actual veteran that lost his hands, is commendable. Current Hollywood should learn from this film; casting an actor with a disability for roles about them shouldn't be this rare and yet it is. Impressed by the nightmarish music, too, in the scene where it fully reflected Al's disoriented state after he woke up. It's not something that I'd listen to outside of this film's context but it suited the imagery and I quite liked it. Also, shout out to William Wyler & his precise camera work that frames everything nicely, in this heartwarming film, as well as for giving us some adorable Al and Milly scenes.This is becoming too lengthy. So lastly I'd just like to say: thanks to this challenge and our host (Bobby Jones), because of whom I have uncovered some real gems, and now personal favourites:  Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, which would've taken me longer to get to; and The Best Years of Our Lives, which I probably would've not gotten to at all because of its runtime and war genre. I'm so glad to now have them etched in my memory.",9,the-best-years-of-our-lives

If the scenario and the insights were not so fascinating, spot-on, and utterly rhetorical this feature could be a problem.

41029,"Good movie. However, the film was plagued by many janitorial inaccuracies. For starters, the first depiction of our “hero” in action is when he, named Will in the movie and Matt Damon in the flesh world, is attempting the easiest of janitorial duties, and that would, of course, be mopping. Despite this being the crudest and simplest form of custodial work, he makes an absolute mockery of it by splashing water on the shoes of students standing nearby. This blatant disrespect for others is something that often clings to the stereotype associated with sanitation experts, despite being something that we in the field work very hard to address. It is a shame to see this gross, and frankly inaccurate, characterization of custodians depicted in this movie from the very early stages of the film. Once graduated from the barbaric duty of mopping, we lay witness to the true art that is, buffing hallways. Well at least that’s what the film wants you to think. In fact, we don’t actually see any buffing at all. They might call it “buffing,” and it may look like buffing to the untrained eye, but it is certainly anything but.   What you actually see depicted in the film makes very, very little janitorial sense. The tool the audience sees Will glide over the floors at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology is actually used to strip the wax from the tile. Leaving the tile bare and unprotected. This process would then be followed by a lengthy re-waxing session, something only done during the off-season, when classes are out for the summer. Now you, as a viewer, must take a step back and ask yourself, “if this Will is so smart, why would he be stripping the wax from the floors, if class is to resume the following morning? Leaving much less than enough time required to re-wax the floors?” Well, maybe folks, janitorial work isn’t as easy as it may seem, now is it? Lastly, and certainly my biggest gripe about the film, may seem incredibly minor, maybe even inconsequential to some, but I promise you that it is of the utmost importance. When on his first date, Will is caught by the viewers, his date, and most importantly, God, performing a “magic trick” in which he is quite obviously seen throwing candies over his shoulder and onto the ground. He does not pick them up. He does not apologize. He does not feel any remorse. This, and I’m tearing up just writing this, this breaks a centuries old janitorial code. When accepted into the world of custodial work, one must pass numerous moral exams of character. The most important being similar to the “Golden Rule” we all learned as kids. “Do unto others as you want others to do unto you.” We as janitors are a community. We pick up after you. We clean your messes. And we take out your trash. But you will never take out ours. We find pride in our service, and we will NEVER be caught adding to the mess that others make. For janitorial work is our job, it is our duty, it is our call. And this little “magic trick” makes it abundantly obvious that no janitors were contacted or referenced during the making of this film. It is egregious to me that this film can put in the work to strive for mathematical accuracy, but when it comes to the duties of the humble sanitation engineer, all decency for the profession is thrown out the window. This arrogance is disrespectful, it is offensive, and most of all, it is harmful to younger generations. By giving less attention and respect to the art of custodial work, we are teaching our children that custodians are less than that of mathematicians. This is despicable behavior, and shocking to see in modern cinema. We as a society should be above this, better than this, and smarter than this. I wanted to enjoy this movie, but it is absolutely appalling to me to see this level of disrespect in a 20th century film. Writers Ben Affleck and Matt Damon will be sure to receive more than one strongly worded letter from me. I hope desperately to see this problem addressed. Father, Husband, Son, and Janitor,-Alex Mower",0,good-will-hunting

Why should I inflict this on us, on you and me?"" ~ AnneFacing one's own mortality is hard enough, but watching someone you love waste away before your very eyes must be almost unbearable. That's the situation Georges (Jean-Louis Trintignant) finds himself in after his wife Anne (Emmanuelle Riva) suffers a stroke. The couple are in their eighties and have lived a very fulfilling life as music teachers. One of their students has become a world-renowned pianist, and their daughter Eva (Isabelle Huppert) has also had success as a musician. But as comforting as memories of the past and pride in accomplishments may be, the reality of dying, immobilized and in pain, cancels out just about all other life experiences.Writer-director Michael Haneke set a deliberately slow pace in unfolding this story of love and decay. He needed the audience to feel what it is like to move and function as octogenarians do. He gets us lulled into their silent resignation, as words lose their meaning and days become dominated by the basic requirements of their bodies -- eat, drink, sleep, defecate, cleanse. When the twist finally comes, and you know for certain there will be one based on the opening scene of firemen breaking into an apartment, it is emotionally devastating and, yes, tears must flow.This film claimed all the year's major prizes for Best Foreign Language Film, winning an Oscar, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award, among many others. It also got the Palme d'Or for Haneke at Cannes. I'd like to rate the film a bit higher than I have, but I couldn't get past feelings that I had been watching a gloomy documentary. As extremely well acted and presented as it may be, the story focuses too much on the heavy side of amour and lacks the counterbalance that some youthful lightness from the daughter's presence could have provided.",6,amour

32028,"Wow. Incredible!Red is easily my favorite film in the Three Colors trilogy. Kieslowski imbues the film with his visual brilliance and consummate storytelling that culminate in a satisfying conclusion to the film and the trilogy itself. The opening sequence with the camera tracking the telephone lines and the invisible wavelength in high speed is executed in such a brilliant way to establish the film’s central themes of superficial connection and invasion of privacy. Couldn’t asked for a better introduction.Red follows Irene Jacob’s Valentine, a model who learns that a retired judge named Kern (Jean-Louis Trintignant) spies on his neighbor’s telephone calls. The movie, bearing relevant political overtones, taps into the contentious issue regarding personal space that is gradually being obliterated by technological advances. Kieslowski seems to suggest that knowing other people’s private information is almost tantamount to having the mindreading power. He also weaves the lives of three different characters together through effective camerawork and smooth editing.As expected, the titular color permeates every shot of the film without overwhelming the scene’s overall color composition. Kieslowski creates rich, interesting central characters brought to life by the riveting Jacob and Trintignant. Each film in the trilogy is defined by distinct emotional themes. If Blue deals mainly with grief and White with bitterness, then I'd say Red deals with guilt.  A truly remarkable piece of cinema by Kieslowski!",9,three-colours-red

16759,"I haven’t felt this way about a film since Mulholland Drive, and I think Persona is even better. The film is sickening, terrifying, and so strange that it makes the viewer feel crazy. I’m not quite sure exactly what is going on, just like everyone else. There are strong themes about the subconscious, the duality of man, and trauma. The cinematography is rightfully regarded as perfect and it was decades ahead of its time. I’ve found the film is best enjoyed when viewed more as an art gallery with several themes, as opposed to a strict linear plot or narrative. I don’t know how Bergman even came up with this, its beyond brilliant.",9,persona
4372,"Schindler’s List exposes the medium of cinema as a fraud—not for nothing, but Spielberg tried very hard to avoid this. A very cautious Spielberg did all one could do to insure the gravity of the Holocaust would be represented in his film story of the Schindlerjuden, the “Schindler Jews,” and their hero, Oskar Schindler. A defensive film in all its formal and aesthetic qualities, it guards against any ill-intention or misinterpreted cinematic grandiosity. Choosing to film it in black and white, for example, was seen as a documentarian’s inclination (never mind that not all documentaries are in black and white—Shoah (1985), the definitive documentary on the Holocaust, was shot in color—and life, for almost everyone, is seen in color, no matter what is being witnessed). Communicating in cinematic language, Spielberg regarded the use of color as a beautifying effect, and therefore an insurmountable problem. I agree with Spielberg on this one charge. Cinema is a beautiful medium. Movies are a celebration of images and the image. At best, the image is fully seen. At worst, the image cannot ever be felt. Schindler’s List is a spotlight on the medium’s inadequacies. In a movie about the Holocaust, where six million Jews were killed, Schindler’s List becomes a film about Liam Neeson’s Oskar Schindler—Schindler and his transformation into a humanitarian—Schindler finessing and defying the purely evil SS functionary Amon Goth (played by Ralph Fiennes). The Jews surrounding them become background actors, co-stars. They end as the ones cheering For Oskar Schindler (he saved about 1,100 of them in his efforts), ignoring his earlier faults (he was a Nazi sympathizer and a cold industrialist), thanking him for saving them. Forget historical inaccuracies—most any film depicting an historical event is bound to have them—the great inaccuracy of Schindler’s List is to believe that there is an imperative to visually represent the “reality” of the Holocaust. Those who’ve seen this “reality” still will never see it. Those who deny the Holocaust will never allow themselves to see it regardless. Many will see Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, and not enough more than that. Spielberg’s desperate, measured approach to temper the narrative drama with “reality” is a failure to understand the medium in his hands. The finished film resembles most any other blockbuster drama. Simplistic concepts dumb down one of the most complex and frightening and largest scaled atrocities in history. As Spielberg is prone to employing, there is his obvious, easy symbolism. It is his wont to use such bright red symbolism in his filmic communications. A particularly disturbing, and I’m sure unintentionally despicable, bait-and-switch sees a group of women shaved and prepared for the gas chamber at Auschwitz, only to survive it in a scene of nearly comic relief. This sigh of relief is unearned for an audience begging for such relief. It is pussyfooting around the subject—there was no such relief. Adorno said, “To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” To make cinema out of Auschwitz is hubris—few make it count. No one is to dictate what story shall be told. This is a part of the “freedom” afforded those artists to whom it is (selectively) afforded. There are movies made about slavery, too. Warfare is a regular agent in the cinema. Rape is a recreated (and created) for the screen. There are movies made with backdrops and plots revolving around all the great atrocities of humanity. There are b-movies on these subjects. And z-grade, I’m sure. There is transgression, and catharsis, voyeurism, and universality in the cinema. There is overpowering propaganda in the cinema. There is money in the cinema. Yet, when there is self-forgiveness, atonement for something one didn’t experience, there is then a propulsion to expel it from memory; to check it off the list and to move on after having falsely reckoned with it. No need to learn about the economic realities of World War 2, or the staggering amount of ordinary people who participated in the attempted extermination of the Jews. There is no need to confront the impossibility of reckoning with it when we have Schindler’s List. Schindler’s List is an unfortunate form of hope. It is sadistic, even ascetic entertainment. Seeing Spielberg’s portrayal of a liquidation of a Ghetto is remarkably hard to watch and unflinching. This is wholly by design. Perhaps the audience, too, expects nothing less. It cannot replicate the shock of living the unknowable and the inconceivable. When the movies teach, they often fail miserably. Spielberg’s attempt at a mass edutainment has been received with gracious appreciation by many. People have worked hard to preserve Schindler’s List and to participate in spreading its message. I can’t help but to see it as a movie in the most crass terms. Despite Spielberg refusing his salary for the film, it made a lot of money. It won Academy Awards for its stars and its filmmaker. Then it took its place in the annals of film history, ripening for future pop culture consumption; going stale as it becomes a classroom cinema. It is another film shown on television with only minimal commercial interruption and buffoonish censorship. Seinfeld based an entire episode around its seriousness. It made a joke out of it. And rightfully so.",1,schindlers-list

14036,"No one simply wishes to be rich. We all want to be richer than others, or become the richest man in the world. Men are inherently selfish. We laugh at the people below us and we wish death upon anyone who's above us. Believe it or not, it's true for everyone. We are all great sufferers of the protagonist disease. This is why when a room has the ability to fulfill our subconscious desires, it is seen as a danger rather than a blessing. No person should have this much power, plus it's impossible for someone to control his or her subconscious thoughts. A man entered the room with the wish of resurrecting  his deceased brother but exited with a handful of cash. What if the same person secretly wanted the world to end? The outcome would be disastrous. Thus, it is locked away in ""The Zone"", littered with invisible traps, surrounded by barbed wires. Andrei Tarkovsky visualized The Zone as a nuclear wasteland. Abandoned sewers, fields of moss, muddy lakes, zero signs of life (excluding plants and a random stray dog). Remember the worst toilet in Scotland from Trainspotting? You get the idea. In such a distressing location is where 90% of the film takes place. Three men ventured inside. A cynical writer who won't seem to stop yapping about ""inspiration"", a professor who values his backpack more than his life, and a stalker who acts as a smuggler.  Like all Tarkovsky films, they discussed philosophy, life, and the meaning of it all. They talked about anything and everything. They recited poems, pondered mortality, and questioned faith. I'd say this film is meant to be listened than to be watched, if it wasn't for the glorious cinematography. Marvelous, marvelous, marvelous visuals. The ever-moving camera, flowing from scene to scene. The setting, a place so polluted the water actually looks cleaner with a layer of oil on it. Plants look like they do not belong to this planet. Yet, Tarkovsky captured everything so beautifully. I've never felt this comfortable being uncomfortable. Just like Solyaris, the ending hits us like a baseball bat to the face. Everything we think we understand from the film shatters within a mere five minutes. And now, however exhausted I might be, I'll have to revisit The Zone again.Part of Axel's project.",9,stalker
59870,"If you ever miss me, take a look at our little portrait.I get why others like it, the core relationship in it was undeniably sweet at times, but I for some reason had trouble connecting with the overall film until the last twenty or so minutes. Gotta be honest, probably the most exciting part of this movie for me was recognizing one of the lead actors from A Dog's Will lol. It was nice seeing him again! I don't really want to call this an ""Oscar bait"" movie or anything like that, because that's not exactly what I thought it was by any stretch of the imagination. Maybe it was more just a little too overdramatic for me as well as looking a little too off-putting visually. The moments where I actually did buy into its emotions and connections came only here and there instead of coming off as a collective force. One of the things a film should never be to me is fake or overdone, and this at times happened enough where it was enough to take me out of the picture except for some of those aforementioned quality moments. With the notable exception of Il Sorpasso where I found it to absolutely be the worst part, even with films in the Top 250 I'm seeing that I'm not that big on, there's at least the consistency of finding all of the endings of these films good.5/10",4,central-station

I was left confused at times until it all became clear, but there are still elements which I don’t fully understand, and that might just be me.

4231,"A piece of hypocrisy. A film that advocates for empathy and compassion but it's clear that the filmmakers never really cared about these people or their well-being. City of God is a widely acclaimed film that made millions of dollars and most of the actors, whose stories and labour were used and exploited, barely saw any of it.This is a common occurrence in art, the cycle of exploitation, and it's a complicated problem. If you list the great artists of any medium, it's likely you'll find dozens of examples. I mean, say what you want about John Ford — ever the private socialist — but at least he actually gave millions of dollars to Native Americans over the course of his entire career whereas I can't exactly say about the makers of City of God and their actors.In the past few years, we've been made more aware of these underlying issues behind some of our “greatest” art, however, it's hard to find any substantial piece detailing the exploitation behind City of God (the main one is City of God: Ten Years Later, which I made sure to watch soon after finishing this film). Why? I don’t know.When thinking about City of God, I’m left with a bitter taste in my mouth.

I don't usually like dance flicks, but this is an exception for me.The Red Shoes is a prime example of fiction imitating life, in which a young woman's dream of dancing ultimately backfires on her. Pressburger and Powell's lush set design and cinematography are always charming, and guarantee a pleasing viewing experience. Between mesmerizing Mediterranean scenery and that shockingly impressive 15-minute dance sequence, this perfectly showcases Pressburger and Powell's masterful visions and commanding skills.Overall, The Red Shoes is a powerful tale of the tolls of ambitions, and how double standards for women forced to choose between profession and romance can be so devastating.

71477,"The prettiest Kurosawa I've seen yet, but also the worst, Dersu Uzala is a film that never quite seems to get going. Whilst the characters of Dersu and the Captain are both likable, there's a lack of depth to either of them. The Captain never goes beyond ""all round good guy"", and Dersu is just ""wise trapper man"". Whilst I wanted to get invested in their growing friendship, it never quite felt real to me. It feels like we're more told that they're friends than shown evidence of it.Nonetheless, there are a few affecting moments near the end of either part of the film. It's also incredibly gorgeous, shot in a distinctly Kurosawa-esque manner, and as such often stunning. The few ""action"" scenes in the film are also pretty tense, and highlight the best aspect of the film's writing: Dersu's quirky wisdom and knowledge of survival tactics. Watching this with my parents we found ourselves discussing what possible meaning Dersu's weird instructions to the rest of the crew could have under stressful circumstances, only to be bamboozled that we didn't see the very simple and obvious application of them, much like the crew itself.Dersu Uzala is slow-paced, somewhat empty, and often boring, but it's also got moments of breathtaking beauty and of genuine human connection.

88321,"probably the most reactionary spider-man story i’ve ever seen, even counting this week’s amazing #26. i disobeyed every impulse guiding me away from watching this, against my better judgement, and was thoroughly disappointed. i didn’t think it was possible for anything under the sun to cheapen my opinion of the first spider-verse but this more than did it. only the depth of my respect for the audio/visual craft (which i won’t waste any more space elaborating on) that went into this and my post-eternals liberation from story-only analysis are preventing me from giving this a lower grade than a C but i can’t overstate how much this movie is flattered by it.i will spare any credence to the notion that the eventual follow-up might push back on some of the ideas in this movie because i know it will come from the same pot that cooked this. i honestly don’t even know where to start. in the first place, the level of cynicism that dripped through every moment of this was just unbelievable. for all the discourse about metamodernism that has popped up recently, i had always seen spider-verse as an anathema to that. a wholeheartedly earnest story about ‘believing in yourself’ that while hardly novel or profound still made zero attempt to deconstruct or atomize the superhero genre. it had a horizontal, almost proletarian take on being spider-man. literally and metaphorically killing the ur-hero in peter parker and putting a skinny black kid wearing jordans in his place. making no gesture towards pulling the viewer out of their immersion. it was a story that, while simple, understood exactly what it had to say and perfectly communicated the inherent appeal of spider-man: the fact that *anyone* could be behind that mask, and they could come from anywhere. be anything, an anime girl, a noir detective, a warner bros. cartoon pig, a ballet dancer, a deadbeat divorced dad. what this movie does is take that honestly radical message and put it into the metamodernism machine™. now, instead of a democratic ideal of spider-man, we are back to speaking the language of empire. strict categories— technocratic jargon (cAnOn EvENtS), taxonomy, hierarchy. vertical bureaucratic agencies (with a figurehead at the top). law enforcement. the spider-verse not as a realm of limitless, infinite possibilities but a panopticon. watched over by an icon of the western monomyth. a reluctant hero who sacrificed everything, who dared to think he deserved a second chance at love, fulfillment, happiness, but had the cold randian reality of ‘life’ shoved back in his face. his entire world literally destroyed as penance for the crime of thinking a spider-man could ever be anything except miserable. wherever steve ditko is, you can be sure he would love this movie. it’s so obvious whatever influence the ‘studio’ had on the direction of the first one has massively increased. every novel flourish or inventive decision from into is back, except robbed of all of its industry, replaced with hollow obligation. so much of this thing, basically the entire middle third, is like watching a sony® portfolio come to life. like something you’d see on an official pitch deck to investors or a corporate website, not a work of art. not an honest expression of someone’s ideas. you can just tell the studio execs said more is better: do everything in the first movie but more. more spiders, make the art more frenetic and less intentional, make the camera shake like it has parkinson’s, dial everything to 11. to say nothing of how obnoxious this movie’s newfound obsession with reminding you that you are watching not just a movie but a spider-man movie— the constant live-action inserts of spider-man films past, the verbal and visual references to the mcu, the incessant winking and nodding towards a metatextual spider-man canon (something that while the first one also did was not nearly as prominent as it is here)— to say nothing of all that, what grated me the most was how reductive it was not just towards spider-man but all superhero stories. the idea that we went from the idyllic optimism of into’s « anyone can be spider-man » to this unbelievably postmodern imitation of a Text; that actually, being a spider-man means following strict guidelines, regulations, doing shit ‘by the book’, the limitless spider-verse reduced and atomized to a well-regulated exhibit, is honestly so insulting. and even if the third one will exist to subvert that somehow, it doesn’t change the fact that an entire 2 hours and 20 minutes that could have been *anything* was dedicated to this. to saying that every spider-man instead of being anything must be a new yorker, must have tragic events underpinning their existence that almost entirely consist of heroic death and sacrifice, of loyal friendships to police captains, of guilt complexes, of trauma fuel. unbelievable thematic rug pull after the first spider-verse.the depth of betrayal to miles textually and metatextually is honestly shocking. to state that he is an anomaly of a spider-man, whose existence went from being a fluke of the universe’s inherent chaos and entropy, to the result of a lab accident, and have the text actually *support* that not only by indeed sending him « back home » to the wrong universe but even showing him an evil mirror image of himself there, divine punishment for daring to believe he could be a spider-man too. being told that his universe’s peter, the one who was radically replaced should actually have lived, effectively undercutting both his message to miles and the central message of that movie is astonishing. again even if beyond pushes back against this, i can’t help but wonder what we’re supposed to take away from it. except that it’s half of a movie. whatever happened to ‘part 1’ and ‘part 2’ naming conventions? the spider-punk character perfectly illustrates the weakness of this decision. his existence begs so many questions that you wonder how he even came to be part of this spider variance authority. same for peter b. and even all his friends from the old movie. it’s almost like it was an afterthought, all to set up the final shot of the movie where gwen’s new band is ready to find their leader. but my word does the structure suffer for it. and to add injury to insult the writers also decide that it makes sense for miles’ friends to have known all of this and not only said nothing but thought it was something they could convince him to agree with or even understand. as if that doesn’t retroactively undermine everything from the first movie. what an insane storytelling choice. and ordinarily the saving grace for this type of thing would be gwen’s performance but she takes such a back seat for the extremely bloated middle that it almost takes away from the start, opening on her, allowing us much needed interiority that lifts her from the purgatory of semi-attainable love interest to being a protagonist in her own right, with her own goals and struggles and obstacles. and both the beginning and end of this movie are much better for it, in spite of everything else. enough has been said of (both) this franchise’s (and the american superhero genre as a whole’s) baffling adulation for law enforcement but it really rears its ugly head here in a disappointing way. an easily-explainable tragedy resulting in her police dad branding her a murderer? because, oh right, spider-man must always be a menace, in addition to all the other things. great.to have gwen compare her spider mask to her dad’s badge is a pretty labored metaphor and calls into question whether or not we’re supposed to believe in the inherent goodness of the multiversal police force (how many fucking movies are going to use this narrative conceit) or to believe in radical disobedience. the critical failure on the story’s part is to let the central conflict rely entirely on « the model » simply concluding that these so-called canon events are in fact ironclad in their determinism. that those worlds do in fact disintegrate, even if they concede that ‘sometimes’ they get lucky, the implication is still that ‘most times’ they don’t. it ultimately asks us to believe in the awesome power of this agency to ultimately reform itself around doing things the right way, instead of questioning why and how it even has to exist. the whole exercise just begs the question of why? why of all possibilities did this have to be the follow-up to spider-verse? why did the contrivances that led to this story have to be made? what message is being sent, what story is being told? this is what was going through my head as i sat down and watched the credits roll. i can only hope that beyond the spider-verse, which i guess i’m now obliged to watch, can claw back some of the ground that this ill-advised foray into everythingeverywhereallatonce-ian navel gazing has lost in my eyes. the only person that my opinion of them wasn’t lessened by watching this was kris anka, whose character design work here both quantitatively and qualitatively is nothing short of flawless. it’s

12852,"oh boy. my first ozu film and it did not disappoint. definitely took a while to get me hooked but once it did it refused to let go. a dense and powerful exploration of generational conflict and family life. following an ageing couple visiting their children and grandchildren, a story that couldn’t be simpler yet one that is incredibly complex. their children are busy with their lives and routine and the grandparents disrupt that. they’re faced with the universal heartbreak of your children outgrowing you. ozu’s style very much focuses on the nuances of every day life, placing people into the foreground of the frame. touching the audience with human feeling rather than the flash and machinery of editing and effects. movement stems only from people or nature, not from the camera. the camera is always perfectly composed, finding itself tucked in a little corner of the interior, blending into the foreground. i felt so much affection for every single shot which is a feeling that is incredibly rare. he shows a room before people enter, lingering a second after they leave. he refrains from cutting away or overlapping a character speaking, displaying the speech in its entirety. ozu is a film maker that understands the power of what is not said, being comfortable in silence and having characters say very little but imply very much. his style is so elegant and humanistic. it lacks the sentimental triggers and contrived emotion, looking away from moments a lesser film would have exploited.it features lovely performances but chishu ryu is the standout. how he so masterfully hides the old man’s grief in nods, agreement, pleasantries and routine. the final moments of the film will stick with me for the rest of my life, as the old woman next door stops by to offer her condolences and sympathy he makes an outpouring of grief in his own way.  “oh, she was a headstrong woman ... but if I knew things would come to this, i’d have been kinder to her."" a pause. ""living alone like this, the days will get very long."" tokyo story is a potent elicitation of humanity and universal heartbreak. one of cinema’s mightiest masterpieces.",8,tokyo-story

63737,"Day #9 of Japanuary! Continuing with the theme of watching Japanese films throughout January, I decided to watch a film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi today.Ugetsu is a ghost story and a tale of greed. Two men are willing to risk losing the most important people in their life in order to be in grand economic standing. They are as self-interested and materialistic as they come. Their wives and neighbors pleaded with them to stop trying to make quick and easy money during a time of conflict, warned them of the potential danger of raids, and these two men refused to listen. One of them even had a young child! The two men's wishes ultimately came true, at least briefly, but not without a cost.Mizoguchi's films continue to impress me. His name often gets thrown into all the conversations about the most influential or best Japanese filmmakers of all time, and it is easy to see why. The shot composition, framing, and transitions are all phenomenal. It is evident that he was always in total control of his craft. There is some seriously beautiful and chilling sequences in not just this film, but every single one that I have seen from him.Some people prefer his films over the legendary Akira Kurosawa's films because they feel like his films have less of a western influence, but what really makes me consider him as one of the all time best is the fact that the themes in his films are universal and the characters are easy to get emotionally invested in. Every film I have seen from him feels ahead of its time in terms of messaging and execution. Japanese culture, folktales, and symbolism are at the forefront of many of his films, but the people he depicts are relatable and easy to care about regardless of the time period or where they are from. Every film I have seen from him has been an emotional experience, but never over-sentimental or melodramatic. Everything he is trying to communicate to the viewer comes off as genuine and well thought out. I know that there are many people who actively avoid older films and international films, but I feel like Mizoguchi's humanistic touch and mastery could draw anybody in, hold their attention, and emotionally impact them.I cannot say enough good things about Ugetsu. It is so good on so many levels. The two men go through a lot of character development and their lives drastically change more than once in a short runtime, but it never feels rushed. The film is perfectly paced with a ton of striking imagery, all backed by a chilling score. Mizoguchi really gets a lot from the whole cast too, as they display a lot of different emotions incredibly well. I can definitely understand why this film is regarded as a masterpiece, and I think it would only benefit from a rewatch. If you have struggled to get into older films or haven't seen a lot of older Japanese films, consider giving Ugetsu or any of Mizoguchi's other films a chance. They are seriously special.",8,ugetsu
5593,"La Haine harbors a palpably burning hatred for bourgeois authority, as is made clear time and time again. Every single frame is entirely encompassed by this titular hatred, and righteously so -- well, not quite.La Haine very staunchly views the working class and their means of defense as infantile; their munitions falsely reimagined as weaponry reserved solely for class infighting and that of the futile, that of the juvenile, rather than for the downfall of the bourgeois authorities that the film appears to insist it despises so much. La Haine takes on a worldview whose every tenet is designed for the further immiseration of the working class, mirrored by a venal propagation of bourgeois ideologies of various forms.La Haine utilizes the working class as a mere tool with which to emptily, inefficiently bash the upper class with - a fool's quest.

17122,"As I was watching this film, my thoughts drifted back to the way in which male filmmakers capture women, particularly the female body, on screen, vs. the way in which female directors and cinematographers capture these images. I may be reaching here since I’m not too familiar with the original source material, but certain parts of the film felt overly sexual to the point of exploitation and was a distraction from what was a very demanding thriller. I’m still a fan of the film overall, but I couldn’t overlook how I felt as I watched it.

4393,"""The list is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf."" - Itzhak Stern, Schindler's List (1993)10/10As some of you may know, this has been at the top of the pile of movies I want to see most for a while now. In fact, it has been for just about as long as I've been making movie lists. My username even stems from it, after all. I finally got around to it, and I loved it. It is perfection. This is seriously one of the best films ever made (as in #18 on both my list and my favorites list, which is the highest ranking of any film with only one viewing on either list). Spielberg's direction is brilliant as usual, and Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes give three of the best performances ever put to celluloid. The editing and cinematography is striking and bleak, the use of color is clever and tragic, and the film is filled with the violence, fear, and pain that filled the world during World War II and the Holocaust. I really liked how it focused on a few Jewish people throughout the movie, showing us the situations they dealt with and how they dealt with them. Secondly, I had always assumed that Schindler decided to save lives near the beginning (at hour or so into the film), but it is far more gradual and I really loved that approach. The film excels by treading the line between hope and hopelessness. It shows us too much evil and brutality to affirm our hope, but shows us too much goodness for us to lose hope. And that ending... talk about empathy and catharsis.

3008,"You know, I kind of like something in this movie. Like, I know it’s really bad but there’s something in it — and not just a young Demi Moore — that made me enjoy it. I have no idea what that was, but sometimes a movie just makes you feel like you’re taking a relaxing swim.Sometime after the bombs got dropped, America is run by a criminal organization called the Merchants. To better control the population — and no, I have no idea how this plan is supposed to work — they get Dr. Paul Dean (Robert Glaudini, whose roles in movies like this and Cutting Class led him to somehow write the play Jack Goes Boating, which became a movie directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman) to create a parasite. Also, because this movie has no plan for what is about to happen, he infects himself to study the parasite, yet is upset when it infects the gang in the small town he finds himself trapped in.And Demi plays the young lemon grower who helps him.Actually, I’ve totally figured out why I like this movie. That’s because it cast Cherie Currie (the ex-Runaway who was on a run of scream queen roles between this, The Alchemist and The Twilight Zone: The Movie) as a post-apocalyptic gang member and Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith as a slave girl. And it was made by Charles Band between Crash! and Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn in a time when he wasn’t yet making puppet movies.A section 3 video nasty, this was in 3D in its original theatrical run.

22400,"[49]Not trying to dissent; after all, I enjoyed THE HANDMAIDEN for its shlocky, grubby fun, and having heard nothing but praise for OLDBOY, I expected something similar(ish), but also something more. But maybe that was my problem -- the modus operandi here is “shock value,” usually in the form of either [1] torturous, gruesome violence (teeth-related stuff always makes me squirm; this was brutal), or [2] overplotted, harrowing revelations. Reminds me of KILL BILL (funny this should come out the same year) w.r.t. the former -- but that’s a Park trademark at this point, and not something I automatically abhor as long as it at least kind of aligns with the general timbre of the film (and in this case, it does) -- and INCENDIES w.r.t. the latter, which is assuredly the most problematic thing for me : viz., a narrative walkway that operates, unfolds, hell, exists solely to serve up a supreme pizza with all the toppings then take a crap on your chest. Yeah, I didn’t see [the twist(s)] coming, truly, but they rely on such belabored, muddy, unwieldy setups that the fun/shock they might elicit is severely undermined in retrospect. Guess you could say the same about THE HANDMAIDEN, to a degree -- and I’m honestly wondering if my reaction(s) to these two films would be flip-flopped had I seen them in chronological order -- but there’s kind of an overboard sense of both fantasy and salaciousness to it that allows its trashy convolution to at least seem plausible “in the realm of the filmic world,” I’ll say. Plus, there was less adherence to violence as a means for manufacturing straight discomfort, and a much more rigid formal quality that felt better cohered to Park’s twisted sensibilities. (And yes, it does fall apart in the Third Act when things get to cumbersome for their own good.) But OLDBOY from the get-go is just one half-baked lapse after another, a continuous exercise in ostentatious design and gaudy surface texture (e.g. the “hallway fight” is maybe the most over-lauded single sequence… ever?) with the depth of a kiddie pool. Ridiculousness can be fun sometimes, sure: THE HANDMAIDEN, by my estimation, is “fun.” This, however, is a little too obnoxious to be “fun” for over two hours. (It’s phenomenally directed and edited, though, so credit where credit is due.)",4,oldboy

26430,"My Journey To Watch More B&W, Foreign and Pre-60s Movies!Film 22 - B&W by cinesethThis summer everyday I have been saying ""Today is the day I watch Satantango"" and two days before schools start I finally got down and saw this motherfucking film. I had some help from my brother (without him I would never have seen it) and I saw every fucking second of this movie.Did I enjoy this? NO! Not even close, dude! Did I like this? Hmmmm no, not. Do I find its importance as a film? NO. Guys I don't get why it is supposed to be such an important film. Let me explain why.It is based on a book, so I can't say that it has such an original script and in fact its plot is something we have seen before in other films and done better (and in a smaller run time). In the sense of the long takes and its direction okay, but it was very reminisce of Tarkovksy and my brother told me that many shots were almost the exact same as shots in Aggelopoulo's The Travelling Players (and because I saw it now, yeah some shots are exactly the same), so it wasn't something mind blowing in that either. Honestly I believe that it is popular, just because of its run time. And like really the 7+ hours were way too many! It could have been at the very least 4 hours smaller and possibly even more. For long parts of the film nothing happens. I mean there was this 10 minutes (literally) take of people dancing and being drunk. SO WHAT? I mean was the point that it is really realistic, even if in the sense that they take a lot of time do certain things? Hmm not everything is for a movie. If I film myself cutting potatoes for ten minutes, because that long is the time it takes me, it doesn't mean that it is suitable for cinema! Now there were things that I liked. The first hour was very good, interesting, paced well and I wasn't bored. Also they did a lot with the timeline that I found really clever. The acting is great and the direction is something I liked, because of the long takes. Other than that unnecessarily long and many times pointless.C",4,satantango

He spends two hours caring for no one but himself even though he was being spoiled by his supporting brother. He manipulated his son and Jane and the whole film surrounds the idea of him being a victim, that pisses me off so much.The cinematography and art direction is great and all but what's the point if the film itself leaves a bitter taste in the mouth?Jane is the true star of the show, Nastassja Kinski is amazing - and her look with the pink sweater is truly iconic. That scene is pure fake-deep dialog on Travis' part, but Jane is truly devastated and you can see how she is traumatized by this abusive relationship.Right now I can't think of more bad things to say about this film but trust me, I'll probably add more stuff here.",1,paris-texas
49564,"A film made for people who read wikipedia pages instead of books. Sad to see we are in for a future of millennial cinema centered around the idea the only thing propagating conflict is people not getting exactly what they want, as soon as they want it, all smuggled in under the guise of representational credentials and Reddit liberal politics. The modern world is so horrible, but we all actually could be the center of the universe in some other lifetime, somewhere in the infinite multiverses we were lucky enough to receive the divine right of kings. Minds far sharper than mine have pointed out how odd it is to make a film about the importance of accepting the existence of queerness (what an achievement), and stuff it to the gills about how gross and kooky it is for men to stick things up their ass — fence-sitting so hard the Daniels risk to have one of its posts land where the sun don't shine.Fitting its largest arthouse reference is to the great pretentious nothingburger of world cinema.Anyone in search of a film about the complications of a working class mother relating to a queer and/or rebellious daughter while an oafish father looks on — Life Is Sweet can be found down the hall and to the left. If forced to behold this — Eisenstein might weep with sorrow that these are the intellectual and ideological chasms montage could justify.2.7/10",1,everything-everywhere-all-at-once
6967,"The quintessential and definitive Spaghetti Western, Sergio Leone’s The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the most exciting and entertaining films ever made. One of the monumental achievements in narrative filmmaking, Sergio Leone’s grandiose western epic is nothing less than a masterclass in movie storytelling, a dynamic testament to the sheer, invigorating uniqueness of cinema. Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile.The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen, Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end.The performances are excellent, Clint Eastwood as the quietly spoken Blondie , Eli Wallach as the humorous Tuco and Lee Van Cleef as the menacing Angel Eyes . Whenever the three share the screen it's thoroughly imposing and intriguing, though that's greatest thing it doesn't just focus on Eastwood's character- but it has another two strong leads.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly set the standard for what audiences see, hear, and feel when the term ""western"" enters a conversation. In time, the film managed to crossover and became a phenomenon. The groundbreaking, grandiose, offensive spaghetti western is great entertainment. Its parody of genre conventions resonates with scope and power, making it easy to enjoy the spectacle.94/100",8,the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly

48888,"when i have free time, my parents will ask me to come into the store and keep an eye on things because despite having the two of them there during store hours, shoplifting is still extremely common. the most common scheme i’ve seen is the ‘buy one take ten’, usually carried out by teenagers. my parents can handle these on their own by simply letting the perpetrator know that they are aware of their plan with a raised voice. we’ve seen enough shoplifting scenarios to know that it really comes down to what the perpetrator chooses to do when given the chance to be honest. when faced with the repercussions, teenagers usually make the right choice because guilt is a killer, but that isn’t always the case. some excuses i’ve heard (not just from teenagers) are ‘i have amnesia’ or maybe even more standard, ‘i don’t understand the language you’re speaking’ (when we speak english). i can see why people would become bitter if this kept happening (i know i would), but my parents aren’t bitter in the slightest. there’s a scene in shoplifters where two kids are caught stealing from a corner store. instead of calling the authorities, the store owner gives the older one two popsicles(?) and says ‘don’t make your sister do it.’ shoplifters is full of little moments like this, little moments that seem inconsequential, but stick. these little moments make every character question their ethics right as we are. we know that what this family is doing is considered illegal. however, shoplifters is operating on a grey moral ground and if there’s one takeaway i can impart, it’s that motivations are messy; no character knows the full extent of why another character chooses to do what they do, even if they are part of the same chosen family. the only thing we can do is to offer our compassion like the store owner to the kids. we have to give them a chance to be honest.",7,shoplifters

16176,"Lately I’ve been making it rain with these 5 star reviews, but I can’t help it. All these films are so good. This one is based on a true event: the Hwaseong serial murders. It was the first identifiable case of a string of murders with a modus operandi. Each victim was strangled to death with their own clothes and raped. The killer was never found. What the film does great is its social commentary about South Korea at the time. I can’t claim to know too much about it, but it’s set in the backdrop of significant political reform against the unelected President at the time who had got to power via a military coup. There are multiple student demonstrations throughout the film, and in one case it leads to a murder being allowed to happen, because the government cannot spare any soldiers as they are busy handling a demonstration. There are also city-wide blackouts and defence drills at schools which show the state of the country at the time. The detectives are fighting against a flawless murderer, the military government and lacking modern equipment. They have to wait for DNA test results from America because they don’t have the technology anywhere in South Korea, and so are basically left helpless for a long stretch of time, only to find that the DNA evident is insubstantial.Song Kang-ho is the ideal casting choice here. Although his character is an arsehole simpleton who, with his even more unpleasant partner, brutally forces confessions out of suspects, Song makes him likeable and endearing and is the source of the few moments of comedy in the film. Kim Sang-kyung is also great, perfectly portraying his cool-headed Seoul detective character and his gradual descent as he gets more and more extreme as time goes on and no progress is made. Everyone else is good too, but I can’t be bothered to talk about them. The pacing is great, and I never felt as if it was getting boring. I also never felt like the time jumps were too much, as there were months between murders. The film does a good job making everything feel fluid and continuous. The cinematography was noticeably striking and evocative, especially the scenes at the end like the tunnel scene and the final scene.Speaking of the final scene, it was amazing. Song Kang-ho’s face is so poignant when he realises that the murderer came back somewhat recently to see one of his murder sites, and is described as a regular, ordinary guy. It could’ve been anyone. Song Kang-ho looking at the screen, staring right at the viewer, is the perfect ending. It’s almost a message to the murderer, just an everyday man, whom there is a good chance is watching the movie.",9,memories-of-murder
46926,"As I proclaimed a few weeks back, 2024 is going to be my year of East Asian pop culture. Considering it's April, it was about time I'd finally watch one of Akira Kurosawa's films.To ease myself in, I decided that Yojimbo might be a good start, as I like Sergio Leone's remake A Fistful of Dollars quite a bit. To put it extremely simple, Yojimbo is basically the same movie: you swap Clint Eastwood's gunslinger for Toshirō Mifune's samurai and have the film in black and white - and that's about it. I even like them both about equally. It seems you can make a proper remake of a foreign film, but you should have someone in charge who knows what they are doing. Leone is a good match for Kurosawa, I guess.To be a little more thorough, it is of course not the same movie. With this first Kurosawa, I am not trying to act as if I am an expeet on his work. But what struck me was his ability to create a dynamic shot. There are constantly leaves rustling over the street,  a fire buring in the background or armies of thugs filling the screen. It's also not just for show, they convey the mood of a scene. The black and white photography is stunning with the most gorgeously contrasted shots. Tonally, this offers a range from thrilling to downright silly - which makes for a great time.Again, it would be a fascinating task to watch Yojimbo and its Spaghetti Western counterpart side by side. Overall, a fine start for my dive into Kurosawa's body of work.",7,yojimbo

57590,"I’m totally speechless by the surreal beauty of La Notte, a sensational cinematography! This classic has an absurd depth in terms of philosophy and with a lot of nuances for the more existential side. Maybe this here is not much of a review and more of a personal analysis of the film as a whole, so I’ll warn you that there will be a lot of spoilers!The film begins with Giovanni, a successful writer, and Lidia, his disappointed wife, in a hospital visiting a dying friend. This scene sets the tone for the film’s contemplation of the mortality, the passage of time and the emptiness that permeates the lives of those individuals. The use of long scenes and striking compositions by Antonioni captures the alienation and disconnection felt by the characters, mirroring everything together with the beautiful urban landscape of Milan.Throughout the film, Antonioni employs a certain visual narrative to convey the internal turmoil of the characters. The juxtaposition of modern architecture along with nature reflects the internal conflicts of the characters between tradition and modernity, stability and change. The recurring change in architecture symbolizes the couple’s attempts to find meaning and connection in a world that seems increasingly fragmented.As the night approaches, Giovanni and Lidia participate in a party where they meet a young woman, Valentina, who becomes a catalyst for the emotional awakening of the couple. Valentina’s exuberance and youthful spontaneity contrast strongly with Giovanni and Lidia’s tired relationship, forcing them to face their own emotional distance and dissatisfaction.Antonioni’s exploitation of alienation and boredom in the film reflects the greatest existential crisis in post-war Europe, where traditional values and beliefs were being challenged by rapid social and economic changes. The search of the characters for meaning and connection resonates with existentialist themes of isolation, freedom and the search for an authenticity that is often destroyed by the attempt of the search itself.In the final scenes of the film, Giovanni and Lidia find themselves alone in a desolate landscape, their relationship seemingly irreparable. As it dawns, they are left with the perception that their search for meaning and connection can ultimately be futile in a world that is indifferent to their struggles. Even after everything that was told to Giovanni about the death of their love, he responds to all this the only way he knows - he grabs and kisses her desperately, pushing her to the ground, despite Lidia’s objections. She says, “No, I don’t love you anymore. And you don’t love me either.” He responds with two words: “Be quiet”.It is a beautiful and powerful meditation on the human condition, exploring the complexities of love and desire. I found the film fascinating as a whole, from the majestic direction to the relentless cinematographic and poetic speeches. We notice that the search for meaning is always something that we human beings seek, but we almost always realize in the last instance that the world is constantly in motion, and this can be devastating.⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ ⠀List: How to fall in love with B&W movies",9,la-notte

22580,"I wish I could give this fewer stars than zero. It’s difficult to put into words how much hatred I have for the existence of this film.An underlying theme of the film apart from vengeance is sexism. The pervasiveness of the possession of women and exploitation visually of sexual assault makes my blood boil. I hate every character in this movie and from 20 minutes in wanted them all to die.The entire plot revolves around the shame of a character rather than the pain and tragedy faced by his sister, the true victim of this film. Her pain is completely disregarded. I don’t even have the energy to finish this review because my soul got sucked away by this sick demonic sorry excuse for a film. I suggest ruminating on the andocentricism of the movie and looking up how the director realized this about this film after having a daughter. Fuck this movie and fuck the patriarchy.",0,oldboy

33066,"i dont have any meaningful criticism or anything substantial to say here so dont come looking for that cause you wont find it. i just have the urge to express my feelings towards this film cause i understand the magnitude of the work i just witnessed and it compels me to write at least something about it.Mirror is a film filled with truly exquisite shots and visually striking imagery that will forever be ingrained in my mind. from the woman sitting on a fence staring into the vast plains of rural russia with her back facing the camera as it approaches her to the burning house where the camera just lingers there, stationary, as two characters stood and stare, the film quite literally feels like moving poetry. its structure is dream-like, scenes flow and transition from one another with little to no regard towards continuity. the director wasnt concerned in telling a story in the conventional sense.  characters appear and disappear from the film like ghosts. theres a woman. a burning house. a child. glimpses of war. sometimes the frame shifts from color to black and white. other times it switches to sepia. the ambiguity and vagueness that these images convey are enhanced by the voiceover narration, through which the director’s own father recites poems written by himself. throughout the film i found myself often lost in my thoughts, wondering and continuously searching for meaning behind the abstraction of these images and words.but im not going to pretend what i just witnessed made any sense at all. i wont give an extra star or half-star just because tarkovsky’s name is attached to it. this is one of the few times i was actually, genuinely frustrated during a movie. i tried my best to keep up with it, i really did,  but at the end of the day, the film just felt like an incoherent mess. just some cool shots and ‘profound’ dialogues jumbled up and thrown together in a mix. believe me i wanted to get in the flow of the movie and focus on the experience and how it made me feel instead of trying to understand it in a logical sense but it did absolutely nothing for me. what i saw was just.. nonsense. now this isnt me insinuating that tarkovsky was a bad filmmaker or anything. this doesnt in any way shape or form diminish his artistry. clearly he was an artist that wasnt concerned in making films that catered to the masses. he simply made art, and theres nothing wrong with that. it’s not supposed to please anyone in the same fashion as a product made in a factory is intended to. if anything, my admiration for his devotion to this art form has only grown. film is art, art is art, and Mirror might just be the purest of them all, but i cant deny the fact that i had an awful experience consuming it. maybe it’ll click with me later when im older but as of now this is how i feel.",2,mirror
61054,"Judgment at Nuremberg has to be one of the most infuriating films I’ve ever seen, if not the most insulting to whatever semblance of intelligence I still cling to. It is a movie which blathering opines in its first act that ‘maybe the nazis weren’t so bad, after all,’ only to later refute this view in its second act and chastise any audience members that had been convinced. This approach can only work if the film treats its entire audience like fools, which it does; assuming they have no knowledge or strong opinions regarding the holocaust, the policies of the third reich, or the actual, real-life trials themselves. If they did, the film might risk them becoming alienated by the end of the first act, which, as I already said, serves as little more than a list of justifications for nazi war-crimes. If you’ve seen enough movies to understand narrative framing, then you might find yourself as shocked as I was by the way this film originally frames the defense. It portrays their lawyer (a fictional character created for the film) as a brave, brash, Atticus Finch-type, and his primary client (another fictional creation) as a stoic, silent, self-righteous man of honor. They are obviously intended to be seen as the underdogs of the narrative, and the film goes to cartoonish lengths to impress upon you their heroism and dignity under metaphorical fire.These exaggerated efforts are applied inversely once the second act starts up, vying to convince you-- ‘wait, no; what if the nazis really were bad guys?’-- in a fashion that surely must have been cathartic to those who went along for the ride, but ends up feeling disingenuous and manipulative to those of us who already knew this to be the case.If you’re not sold on the film’s initial premise, you can’t be surprised when it’s subverted later on; just annoyed it didn’t happen sooner. I don’t understand how this movie is so widely praised; isn’t this technique the exact reason why American History X is typically considered to be a piece of shit? The first act of that movie has literally been used as a recruitment tool for neo-nazis, because the only thing you need to do to it to make it propaganda is just to isolate it within the narrative.Here, I feel like you could clip the whole movie in two and even Goebbels himself would’ve approved of the first half. And don’t even get me started on the usage of actual holocaust footage here; suffice it to say that I found the entire section exploitative and disrespectful-- both to the dead, and to their families. There’s a much longer essay I’d like to write about my thoughts in regards to respectfully covering such tragedies, but here is not the place for it. So, cryptically, I’ll leave off by saying that the only two films I know of which I feel handle the Holocaust respectfully are Night and Fog and Shoah. And nobody in my family has ever made it more than an hour into Shoah without falling asleep.",1,judgment-at-nuremberg

80590,"It is the perfect example of how to start a movie at the end and swiftly transition to a flashback. An English squad completes a practice exercise where they 'capture' Major-General Clive Candy despite orders to begin the next day. Enraged at the leader's disrespectful attitude, Candy throws the man into a pool; a camera pan looking down at them moves up, they exit the frame from below, and a young Candy enters as we arrive at another pool in an unbroken take. That's a fantastic opening, returning forty years to depict Candy's life in three chapters. Roger Livesey delivers a transformative performance, accompanied by Deborah Kerr, who plays three parts, and Anton Walbrook as a German solider who bonds with Candy after a tense ordeal. The first chapter captures excitement and friendship through a drastic measure of honor and loyalty to one's ideals. But the other two become melodramatic, overlong pieces to the man's life, removing that engagement and replacing it with historical notes and lifelong regrets. I loved the first hour, but the film did not justify its runtime. The acting is terrific, especially between Livesey and Kerr, even if this epic prefers the ""tell, don't show"" method of storytelling.🔙Shadow of a Doubt (⭐️⭐️⭐️)🔜Somewhere in Queens (⭐️⭐️⭐️)",5,the-life-and-death-of-colonel-blimp

25370,"At some point in the film, I thought I was going to give this film a 10/10, but as the rest of the film came along, the film’s flaws exposed themselves to me.Something that annoyed me from the start off was the camera movement. I believe I’d have enjoyed Love Exposure a lot more if the camera work wouldn’t have been so fast, constantly moving and energic. The same goes for the editing; as my pal Terminator1984 said, ""I hate bad editing."" Something that in particular was bad was how the conversations were edited. I like to see the reactions from the ones who are being told something, but Love Exposure didn’t work that way. The goofy music in the 1st and 2nd act should have been replaced by some serious tones. Overall I couldn’t take the dramatic scenes in the first three chapters serious because of the score.I just didn’t connect with Love Exposure. The ending became over the top, and the characters take weird decisions, that has been taken no development into. The climax was extremely dissapointing, considering what the four first chapter built upto. I honestly expected Sion Sono to go full controversity, but it was nothing better than a romantic comedy, made in Hollywood. It’s like he added what he wanted to (the first four chapters fyi), just to make it a crazy film. He doesn’t answer any questions. Why is it Yoko hates men? Why did he fall in love with her? Why is he suddenly joining those guys taking pictures of skirts? Why is there an erected penis that is being cutted off. Because it’s fun? I could mention a lot more, but that’d be spoilers. The film just wasnt for me. I don’t see any fun in how crazy it is without a rather good explaination to it all, and how over the top it becomes (something Fight Club also suffers from).

67874,"First, Sorcerer is a horrible name for this movie.  Wages of Fear is 1000 times better.  I just watched Wages of Fear 8 days ago, so, while I don't like to judge remakes against the original too much, I might point out some differences.  In Wages of Fear, the first hour is spent in the same one-street town.  In Sorcerer in the first 20 minutes we have been to Jerusalem, Paris, New Jersey, and Central America.  In Wages of Fear we really get to know the men and their relationships with each other, but we don't know why or how they came to be in South America.  In Sorcerer, we don't get to know the men and not much is done with any relationships between them, but we know why they ended up in a back-water Central American town.  Also, Wages of Fear is more desert like while Sorcerer is jungle and mud.  And finally, Wages of Fear is a great film, while Sorcerer is a great genre movie.  I really liked the first 20 minutes here.  I almost wish it had kept going in that vein, but then it would have been a different movie.  Friedkin does a good job with the suspense, especially on the suspension bridge.  (see what I did there?)

81090,"“The thing that scares me most is that everyone's gonna try to rehabilitate me.”That this began filming just over seven months after the war's end says some very important things. While not wallowing in self-pity, this is an honest movie depicting a Nation licking at some open wounds. I may be removed from these events by some great distance & time, but found myself hopelessly drawn into the tale. By the time Capt. Fred Derry (Dana Andrews), Sgt. Al Stephenson (Frederic March) & Petty Officer Homer Parrish (Harold Russell) view a field of abandoned planes on their approach to home, I was quite protectively breathless of these 3 strangers already. In fact, I was daring the film to disrespect or treat them badly in any way. Knowing only the briefest of synopsis, I knew this was likely to be an emotionally affecting viewing. Three men return to their homes following the War. That’s the nutshell enough to crack me…During WWII my wife’s Grandmother Marjorie Brooks received that Telegram. Her husband Raymond was missing in action, presumed dead. A couple of months later she was walking home with her Mother, & announced that Ray was going to be waiting for them back home in the kitchen. And he was! His plane had been shot down & the survivors hidden & smuggled through occupied territory by the French Underground. I had the privilege of documenting his experiences some years ago.So when Homer’s Mum choke-sobs on her boy’s return sporting 2 hooks for hands, & when Milly (Myrna Loy) pauses & instinctively knows Al has just come home, & when Fred’s dear old pop can’t find the words… that was me blubbing bubbles for 10 minutes or so.Not long after, I realised how each of the women in the men’s lives were the grounded, rational driving force to each plot strand. I totally sided with Fred’s wife Marie. She’d had to get on & make a life. It looked like a better one Fred came home to than he left. Whatever was missing in their relationship to begin with, he exacerbated the problem by being instantly smitten with Al’s daughter Peggy (a superb Teresa Wright). I didn’t blame Marie at all for feeling gipped when she’d waited, only to be swiftly passed over. Milly kept tugging my heartstrings from the moment she relents to the celebratory night out. Her patience, pride & understanding just melted me. None more so then when Peggy utters a spiteful outburst at her parents, only to see her Mother turn to her Father & say: “How many times have I told you I hated you & believed it in my heart? How many times have you said you were sick & tired of me; that we were all washed up? How many times have we had to fall in love all over again?” Holy cow that’s some honestly written slice of life right there. We didn’t get to see a lot of girl-next-door Wilma. What reference we got was enough to make the scene of Homer showing her his bedroom routine so very bittersweet. He thinks he’s giving her fair warning & chance to back away. She takes as opportunity to show she sees past the disability & still loves the boy she grew up next to. I don’t think Homer getting less screen time than Fred or Al was anything to do with being an unknown actor. I know I groaned at the 171 minute runtime initially. However it is that rare achievement of feeling fast & full. I ended up noting the gaps in returning to Homer, but his circumstances weren’t where focus was needed. Each time he showed that there was plenty he could cope with, Homer demonstrated that expected & admired attitude of ‘I’ll be fine’ / ‘it’s just a scratch.’ All we needed to see was that one nightime view of him crying silently in bed. The Academy were cautious & confused, leading to the peculiarity of 2 Oscars for one performance. The voters agreed. The audience agreed. And I agree – Russell was so unique a find, he was meant for the role. You know, for some time into this interwoven trio of tales – I was thinking how straightforward a job it was in terms of camerawork. I think I had that in mind from the cab ride into Boone City at the start; a series of identical sweeping pans at one business after another (Woolworths!). I lost track of when, but at some point I noticed a lot of deep focus photography in use. This most evidenced itself at Butch’s Place; the best pub-around-the-corner den of optimism one could hope for. Never crowded. Drinks are on the house. Merry to be made on the piano. This was such a strength of the script, to have this in Homer’s life & a plausible place for the three to keep reconvening. Reading up on the movie subsequently, I found others had noted what I had. Foreground action secondary to what’s happening in the background, & that we can see & be absorbed in because of that deep focus photography. Fred promises Al he won’t see Peggy any more. Homer crosses at the door & is sat with Butch at the piano. As they play right before us, there’s Fred making the call to Peggy, then leaving – once again lost & lifeless. Regulars at the Golden Reel Gin Joint have seen the name of composer Hugo Friedhofer front & centre once before upon Violent Saturday. No, I don’t recall that score either. For all my years a fan of the craft, his is one of those voices to never really distinguish itself to my ear. A cellist first, then an orchestrator at Warner Bros for years – most commonly alongside Max Steiner. Only later, about the time of this movie was he composing fully more than assisting others. Well, it’s a stirring enough overture of an opening title cue but then… I only became conscious of it during a couple of scenes between Milly & Al talking, when I thought it slightly intrusive. This is film music that for the main does exactly what is needed; accentuate emotion unobtrusively & bridge narrative gaps. It’s not a film for heroic fanfare, or swooning love themes.    There’s a short Suite here to illustrate. Earworm not guaranteed or expected...SIMPLE, WONDERFUL MOMENTS:- Milly carving lines on the tablecloth with a fork to keep count of Al’s drinking.- Peggy shucking peas at the kitchen table. - Marie playing with her wedding ring as Fred tells Cliff to get out. - Giussipi at the Italian diner during the untouched lunch between Peggy & Fred, saying: “the apple-a pie-a, she's a-home a-made.”Viewed courtesy of the YouTube & for The Golden Reel Gin Joint",7,the-best-years-of-our-lives
86441,"Sometimes I think people will fall for anything that is rife with anguish and distress as long as it is buttressed by sanctimonious uplift, no matter if it is phony uplift. Batter our emotions early so you can blast us up into nirvana at the end. Mommy, the Canadian-French quackjob melodrama with English subtitles, has in recent years gathered an idolized reputation, even though its tale of a free spirit but ineffectual mom and her belligerent teenage son is 139 exhausting minutes long, is repetitious in its troubles wallowing, and, worse, is  presented in a 1:1 aspect ratio. That aspect ratio doesn't even feel like square size (it's like 05:1), it's more like a rotated rectangle, i.e., has the feel of being practically vertical. Why did the director Xavier Dolan choose this picture dimension deliberately? To say something about the squished-in lives and confined non-growth of the characters (the mother and son break out of the aspect ratio twice, to symbolize burst of liberation or to dream of a better world). The film, with its verité chop-chop, has no narrative synchronicity or flow cutting symmetry, which only adds to the misery. Social points? The film opens with a hypothetical concept that doesn't actually exist (so yes, hypothetical), that moms with uncontrollable brood can send their children to state institutions to reform/re-educate youth, but if we're going to have peace officers and healthcare attendants work these wards they ought to be trained to not be feckless browbeaters but be helping hands. As for nirvana, we don't see it, but I hope the mommy gets to go out a date one day again. The short-lived flirting with random men throughout was already tiring. Let's see her liberate and go.",1,mommy-2014
55104,"Of course, the rich and famous are all shallow and bored. Ugh. How I hate such simple-minded generalizations, such infantile cynicism. Shouldn't a director be smarter than that? Watching a movie rarely felt like this much work. Three hours of hard labor, that's what La Dolce Vita was for me. I will never understand why a director would choose to make a movie about completely shallow people. What's the appeal? None of the characters felt like a living, breathing person (maybe Mastroianni in certain moments). I find myself completely shocked as I love Italian film and have a slight obsession with Rome, so I was confident that I would at least enjoy it for getting to visit the city in my mind and listen to the beautiful language. But the movie and its annoying people irritated me so much I couldn't even enjoy the view. The only thing I loved was the opening shot, with that helicopter flying a Jesus statue across town. Made me very hopeful that I was in for some major treat. But when I bit into it, all I found was air. I can't believe that people compare The Great Beauty to this. These two films have nothing in common except that they're both set in Rome, centered around an Italian man who wants to write, one has a lot of hair, the other one barely any left. Apart from that, they couldn't be more different. The Great Beauty is about everything, La Dolce Vita is about nothing.",3,la-dolce-vita

57370,"“This Is Your Life, And It’s Ending One Minute At A Time.”I’ve always felt uneasy about the day I post a review on Fight Club, seeing as it is one of Letterboxd’s highest rated films of all time with a whopping 4.3 mean score. I fear for the one-sided response towards my rather pessimistic review. Because with all honesty, Fight Club is perfectly fine. Fight Club is a film I believe to be thought a little bit too highly of. I’m really not the biggest fan of Fight Club. There’s plenty of reasons, of course. One is the wind-down in the third act not being able to match the manic and zany energy of the first. I don't think Fincher is particularly well-suited for Palahniuk's pop-philosophy, but even still, there's a lot I like about it. It's just not that. Fincher thrives on methodologies. The way he processes exposition imitates reality without the need to solely rely on it. In the context of a pseudo pop philosophy-lite ejaculation like Fight Club, he's out of his depth. It just seems off. You know the movies when you know exactly what the twist or reveal is going to be about 20 minutes in? That’s me with Fight Club. Maybe the film wasn’t really trying to hide it in the first place, maybe not, but I'm not usually good at predicting twists, and that one was crazy. When the scene with Tyler Durden appearing on the plane came on, I just couldn’t believe it, and I don’t mean that in a good mind-blowing way. The entire time I was like: ""Is this mofo actually real?"". And for some reason, in that certain situation, I simply didn’t buy it for a good minute. Look: I think Fight Club is technically impressive but heavily reliant on a lot of smoke and mirrors when it comes to writing. After all, Fight Club’s first act is up there with any of Fincher’s best work.But remember, Fight Club is also but an adaptation of a book written by Chuck Palahniuk, a gay man, with the intention of criticizing internalized homophobia and toxic masculinity, which very much serves as an allegory for this manufactured hyper-macho façade parts of society have constructed. All the more reason why the film, to a decent extent, fundamentally misunderstands its own themes. The whole thing is plagued with so much try hard pseudo pop-macho bullshit that it ends up glorifying the very unpleasantries it vowed to combat. And now, amateur cinephiles are out here venerating Tyler Durden, whether ironically or not, without the misguided communications of themes ever crossing their mind. In time, we’ll all hopefully realize that this sigma male and gigachad adulation we throw at all of Fight Club’s poorly crafted caricatures showcase a great deal of disrespect. Or you could just tell me that I’m just flat-out wrong and it really does critique everything I just said. But it’s been years since I’ve disagreed and I don’t think I’ll ever change my thought process on this.It’s a common case of films garnering this special type of cultural impact where good movies become so beloved to the point where it makes me suspect that someone's favorite film has been the same since they were sixteen. Now, if they have some solid reasoning, that's fine ... just makes me raise my eyebrow, is all. It falls under the same set of films like: Pulp Fiction (which I like btw), The Dark Knight, and Drive. In terms of taking the cinephile culture by storm, I’d call Fight Club the 90s Joker. Don’t worry, I still think Fight Club is significantly better than Joker. It’s just one of this films whose teen philosophy hits hard with a certain generation and it will always, always, and always be overrated. Every movie-going generation has a movie like this, where it really matters the age you were when you saw it, how many other movies you'd seen, etc. There’s a lot of great stuff packed in this film with a lot of great and memorable sequences; however, I struggle to acknowledge Fight Club as some sort of cinematic breakthrough. We don’t talk about Fight Club because it’s overrated af.",5,fight-club

26411,"I guess it's safe to say Tarr is apparently not my speed or flavor, despite bearing many sensibilities I typically adore. As with Werckmeister Harmonies, I can't reconcile the long stretches devoted to instilling a suffocating atmosphere with the (comparatively) narratively dense scenes. Both are perfectly fine modes—though I much prefer the atmospheric side where the quiet, long takes with little to no narrative function create a sort of cinematic ambiance that's simultaneously bleak and serene—but the two sides don't cohere or compliment one another, in my estimation. It creates this jarring discordance where one moment I feel transported into these extreme wide shots of the dilapidated town, and the next moment I'm trying to process a minutes-long monologue. It's a shame Tarr retired, because The Turin Horse is my favorite of what I've seen from him; it felt like he was leaning more toward the punishingly slow and narratively sparse side to which I respond more emphatically.Regardless, I highly recommend checking this out if you're even remotely interested in the idea of a 7+ hour nihilistic Hungarian drama that contains elements of literature, theater, and poetry, but is distinctly cinematic. I'm not sure if other theaters will follow suit, but for this week, Film at Lincoln Center is running a ""virtual screening"" of the new 4K restoration for a $14.99 rental. For more than a decade, I've avoided watching a crummy quality version online, in hopes that it would eventually get a proper restoration or release, and even though I didn't catch it in a theater last year, I'm so glad I finally got to see this restoration, because it is visually magnificent.

58025,"“He is ambitious. Children kill their parents for less. This is a wicked world. To save yourself you often first must kill.”Akira Kurosawa is an absolute genius. I have yet to watch a film from him that I can find a single flaw in. When Throne of Blood started I was unsure if I was going to like it as much as his other films that I’ve seen but by the end of it I was completely floored by the story and technical ability of Kurosawa as a director once again. I might even like this film more than Seven Samurai which is saying a lot but I’m not quite sure yet. From just a storytelling standpoint I think this is Kurosawa’s second best right behind Ran.When it comes to Shakespeare there’s only two stories that ever really stuck with me and one of them is Macbeth. It’s my second favourite piece from Shakespeare right behind Julius Caesar, so seeing that Kurosawa did his own retelling of it had me so excited. This surpassed my expectations. Seeing all the allusions to Macbeth throughout this film was just amazing. The way Kurosawa kept the stories so similar and yet completely made this his own is masterful. The themes are all the same but it’s the world Kurosawa creates here that elevates the story beyond what it already was.Throne of Blood is one of Akira Kurosawa’s finest showings when it comes to the technical aspect of his films. In my opinion this has his best shot framing out of the ones that I’ve seen so far. Every single shot in this movie looked absolutely amazing and I can only imagine how much better it would look in colour, although the black and white really adds to the haunting feel of the film. The shot of the horse chase through the trees was brilliant filmmaking and my favourite shot of the whole film is when Lady Asaji goes to grab the sake and comes out of the darkness as if we’re watching a devil come out of the shadows.Kurosawa uses the sounds of the environment like the heavy winds and rain to really add to the atmosphere. A lot of the score even early on has a very eerie sound to it, almost foreshadowing something disastrous to come which is of course Washizu’s decent in madness just like Macbeth. The script writing is just perfection in this especially when it comes to Lady Asaji. As evil as she is, her character was by far the most interesting for me and this is actually the case for me with Lady Macbeth from the original play as well. Seeing the way in which planting little seeds of doubt into someone’s mind can create so much paranoia allowing them to be manipulated almost at will. Fear drives us more than we even realize as humans, so if you make someone fearful you can get them to do almost anything.The themes of Macbeth and of course in turn Throne of Blood are what really leave an impact. It not only shows us how easy an individual can be manipulated through fear but also how dangerous unchecked ambition can be. The lust for power can completely consume a person to the point of not fully seeing everything around them for what it is and once it’s achieved can corrupt even the greatest individuals. When you’re lower status you always have someone to listen to and follow, once you reach the top all you have left is looking down at those who want to take your spot. Power is a gift and a curse.The acting performances in Throne of Blood are all so great but mainly carried by two actors. Isuzu Yamada who’s the actress for Lady Asaji was so impressive in this film. It’s one of my favourite performances because of how ominous and sinister her character felt and then of course there’s Toshirō Mifune who’s amazing as always. From what I’ve seen he just can’t give a bad performance. There’s a reason that Kurosawa chooses to work with him in so many of his films. Throne of Blood is a work of art when it comes to filmmaking and now another Kurosawa film that’s in my all time favourites.Akira Kurosawa RankedMy Top 50 Films",8,throne-of-blood
80531,"WC-Challenge #20 – Anniversary Challenge (time flies!) For the 20th round, the whole WC-crew got to see the classic British film ""The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp"" by Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. For me, the movie is a rotten, stinky butthole and I will spread its cheeks to show you why. Short Synopsis:The film shows the life (without the death) of General Candy, who took part in three wars and had some other stuff going on too. I have seen the film 1.5 times. The first time I saw it, I had to turn it off halfway through. I'm glad I didn't see the film on a plane, because that movie was so boring, I would have walked out of it. That was about 1 week ago. Yesterday I started again from the beginning, because I wanted to give the film another chance and not completely live out the initial hate in my review. It thought, ""maybe I was just not in the right mood for a 3-hour epic from 1943"". Now I know for sure, I am a hater! Some things I liked though. I've hardly seen any films from the period, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I imagine the cinematography and images were unique (Keyword: Technicolor). The film looks insanely good and has great camera movements, set pieces and transitions. You also have to acknowledge that the film came out in 1943 and was a bit ahead of its time in some depictions: the portrayal of Edith Hunter and the sometimes satirical spoofing of military, rituals and masculinity. I also enjoyed the differentiated portrayal of Theo, the German friend. A portrayal that, during the war against Germany, is daring and not self-evident. Every now and then I also found the film funny, especially the scene in the bathhouse at the beginning, when we first meet the old General Candy. I liked the mask and the wild, exaggerated speak after his nap. But the film left me cold on the whole. I didn't care about the characters, especially Candy. For me, the film was neither exciting, interesting or emotionally moving, but too long, incredibly boring and annoying. As a result, I started to pick the film apart and I kept noticing a thing that annoyed the hell out of me – the non-portrayed colonialism. The actual plot of the film begins with Candy wanting to travel to Berlin because a German (Kaunitz) claims that the British killed women and children in the Boer War. Kaunitz is called an ""awful, little rat"", shown to be a spitting idiot and his description of what happened is portrayed as German propaganda, which Candy can't let stand. He was himself an officer in South Africa for 7 months during this war. So he travels to Berlin, confronts the German and insults him, which leads to the duel, where he then meets his new German friend Theo. The Boer War and the accusations are never mentioned again in the film!I don't know much about the Boer War, but a quick Google search reveals the classic picture of British colonialism. The British oppressed Boers in South Africa in order to plunder the natural resources (diamonds and gold) in Boer territory, which is why there was resistance. The British set up concentration camps where about 120,000 inhabitants were imprisoned, with about 26,000 dying due to the disastrous conditions (mainly women and children, according to Wikipedia). So the ""villain"" Kaunitz told nothing but the truth, actually. But, as I said, that fact is never mentioned again. The movie was released in 1943. The Boer War ended in 1902, so the film came out 41 years after that conflict ended. Is this pure denial of history or plain propaganda? In general, the British military is constantly exaggerated and portrayed as decent gentlemen who always fight fairly and treat their opponents well, even in war and colonialism. Which they also discuss at a table where the British heads of the colonies (including Uganda, Jamaica, etc.) sit together and pat each other on the back. What a fucking joke!When Officer/General Candy is sad, he travels back to Africa, goes on safari and shoots every animal that exists there to hang its head as a trophy in his own home. He even killed a fucking elephant and a polar bear! Why the fuck would I care for him? In the end, the war-loving, old man, who has lost nothing through the wars but gained everything and profited from it his whole life, is sad. Sad because the new military generation no longer wants to fight the Nazis in a ""gentlemanly"" way. And now he´s even too old to go shooting some animals in Africa. Oh, you poor thing! But don’t worry, when the military marching band walks past him at the end, the old chap, who benefited from the cruelty of the colonialism, looks emotionally into the camera and salutes with a joyful, proud smile on his lips and tears in his eyes! What a Happy End! Maybe I just didn't get the movie. Is this an overlong, boring, toothless satire? A war movie that doesn't even slightly address the horrors of war? A romance or character study? All of the above? Nothing sparked for me.Of course, I also realise that I can´t blame an expensive mega-blockbuster from this period (1943!!!) too much for being not critical of its own wartime past, colonialism or the military. When the film was made and released, it may not have been the right time to take a critical look at the British military. If it did, it would have been an impressive, interesting film. But as it is, it leaves me with the impression that it is an overlong, boring, propagandistic film of its time.PS.: Loved the stache tho!",1,the-life-and-death-of-colonel-blimp

Once I start a movie, I have to finish it no matter what, but this was the first time in a very long while where I had to get up and start doing something else, and just watch it periodically in the background. Two thirds of this movie is nothing more than people walking. That is not an exaggeration. There is seriously a combined total of about 100 minutes (out of 145) in this movie where the only thing happening is people walking or occasionally running, usually without any dialogue.I've been trying to figure out how a movie like this can end up so revered by so many people. I know it's shot beautifully, and I appreciate the artistry there, but none of the images depicted are interesting enough to sustain their shot length. So I think the appeal of movies like this may be similar to the (insane) idea that horror movies are scarier when you don't see anything, and it's instead left to the imagination. Maybe when movies are this fucking boring, people just start making up a movie in their own head that is far more intriguing, without realizing that whatever brilliant product they're imagining is not actually representative of the bullshit that they're watching.

Even the classy cast can't make much impact against such flimsy, stripped down material, with even the likes of Henry Fonda and Audrey Hepburn left mouthing edited highlights of the text.",3,war-and-peace

34928,"Originally posted on my blog.Hu Bo's film explains its enigmatic title straight away. The characters in this film, set in modern day China, have heard of a Circus, in a different city, where there is an elephant that sits still. The elephant could be thrashed or beaten (the film tells us) but it just sits still. On one level, and there are many levels at play here, it is a metaphor for persistence - a reflection of the cold world of hurts and harms that we have to bear, and that the characters bear in this film. On a much more important level, this elephant that sits still is a metaphor for depression. It is a large and unignorable presence that overwhelms. It is defined by waiting and by being static. It is always there, and the idea of it dominates the thoughts of the characters, and it is the symbolic weight that holds them down. It is just this irrational, incongruous and unexplainable thing that will not change. Why does the elephant sit still becomes a symbolic translation of 'why are you sad?' That's just how things are, and they won't change.At this stage, it is important to mention the factor that overhangs this astonishing film. This film is written, directed and edited by Hu Bo. It is adapted from a story from one of his novels and it is a work of staggering complexity that is defined by confidence and a singular focus. Tragically, before the film was released, Hu Bo died of suicide. This is his debut film and it will always be his only film. It is very hard to come to terms with this.Hu Bo was a student of Bela Tarr, one of my favourite filmmakers, and this influence is evident. However, this is not an act of imitation. Like a Tarr film, this is made up of very long takes. Also, like a Tarr film, this aesthetic does not feel like a gimmick or an affectation but a core part of the film's intentionality. The elephant that the film is named after is also somewhat of an echo of the whale at the heart of Tarr and Hranitzky's Werckmeister Harmonies. In that film, like in this, the large creature represents something overwhelming but also something beyond us. Yes, the elephant that inspires the characters is a symbol for depression, but it is also a symbol of hope and of the Sublime. The characters are imprisoned by their environment and, in many cases, by themselves. The elephant is something larger, something different, something unexplainable but also something static - something reliable. It is a destination and a purpose.I am aware that an almost four hour long film that is fundamentally about depression, and that has the surrounding context this film has, is not an easy sell. However, though it is a very bleak and very sad film, ultimately it is deeply empathetic. This presents multiple storylines over the course of one day. The characters exist in separation, at the beginning, but their paths start to cross in various ways. The intersections are reminiscent of the overlapping sequences in Tarr's Satantango. Like in that film, you start to think about things differently, as mixing narrative threads force you to reflect on the way that things are connected. The characters here are connected by many things. There are echoes and motifs throughout the film, as the different characters experience similar circumstances. Though, at no point does any of this feel contrived, even when we realise that multiple characters are motivated by the releasing of different compromising videos about themselves this echoing (and it is one of many echoes) does not feel forced. The rhyming structure of conflicts and circumstances has a lot to say about the human condition, in which we are victimised and limited by similar things. Many films show human connection and humanity through positive connection, how our joys are universal. This film shows how our sufferings are universal too, and that is very important. Primarily, this film is an ever increasing web of tragedy and conflict. As the film progresses every storyline intersects in ways that grow more and more complex. The possibility space for tragedy is very wide and we see a lot of it. This is not just a pessimistic onslaught of negativity, it is an important revealing of a societal trait. This film does not think it is human to hurt each other and to suffer but it does recognise that this is something humans do. By being so long, this film lets us see such a wide portrait, and understand the motivations behind certain things that will be forever obscured to other characters. Quite simply, what we see is a world in which people are marginalised and scapegoated, and in which they pass their pain onto each other.We also see a world in which people are just in need of help and understanding. Fundamentally, everything in this film is solvable. It all goes back to somebody needing to be there, to somebody needing to intervene. At points, the film gets close to just saying this - but it knows implication is much more powerful than exposition. This is not a cruel dirge; this is not nihilism. This film is a beautiful portrait of the need to look out for each other; the need to understand what we are all going through and the important knowledge that tragedy spirals outwards. The tragic lives at the centre of this film could be assisted at every point. A more caring society, a more present society and the existence of caring institutions would save all of this. This film is a film of hope, and it ends utterly beautifully in a way that could not be described as a happy ending but is definitely a optimistic one. Our characters do achieve something, even if it is only very little in the grand scheme of things. But, they only achieve anything through a symbolic form of collective action. Again, the message is a need to look our for your fellow humans and to work with them. This film can be too easily read as a condemnation of the world and of humanity. It is not this. This film is a deeply humanist rallying cry about the need to better ourselves and to think outside of ourselves.Messaging aside, it is also just an incredibly made film. The craft, and its effect, echoes back to the thoughts of Russian Formalism: the ideas that art can be scientifically deconstructed for meaning and that aesthetics should never be pure aesthetics. Nothing in this film is art for art's sake. It is a long film full of stylistic flair but every frame is deeply purposeful. For this reason, it never feels its length. There is a hypnotic consistency to the film that makes it utterly mesmerising, with no wasted moments. At the end, I truly wanted more and wanted to watch it again.Let's start by dissecting the long takes. The camera takes on an unobtrusive and passive role, the extended takes allowing the filmmaking to fade into the background. It is easy to forget the filmed aspect and to read things as reality, as the beautiful acting sells everything completely. The long takes are also thematically important. Again, this film is about depression, or about a depressive mental state. The monotony of uninterrupted footage mirrors the passivity of our disaffected protagonists. The film is made up, to a large extent, of their blank and unblinking stares. We just see hollow and empty people in front of us and the camera takes on this affect. This makes it deeply immersive and evokes the perfect atmosphere. The camera does often move with characters but it primarily positions itself as a constant mid-shot. This idea of being a step removed perfectly matches themes of disassociation and, of course, matches the emotional core of the film. So much of this is about passivity and being numb to the world - linking back to the stationary elephant - the perpetual camera and its perpetual distance sell this perfectly.Even the way focus is used is perfect though, as banal details are often foregrounded and in focus, with moments of conflict happening out of focus in the back of the frame. At one point, a very intense thing happens in a restaurant. We hear screams and see the dancing light caused by an offscreen fire. But we don't really see anything. This becomes part of the perpetual backdrop of the film, the idea that there is wider conflict and suffering all around - and also the idea of emotional numbness. A very late sequence involves a climactic encounter, which is astonishing, and which ties up so much of the narrative. When it gets to the moment of action that you know is coming, the camera focuses on the character at the front of the frame sat with his head in his hands. Something intense and core to the narrative is happening in the frame, but it is put in the distance and out of focus. This film prioritises emotional storytelling over exposition and is all geared around presenting a cohesive experience. This is also achieved through lighting and colour grading. The whole film has a washed out, bleak tone. Everything is grey and desolate. This adds to the monotonous numbness and is partially achieved by the film being shot at the same time of day, for three hours a day, over stretch of time. Where directors like Malick, and even Michael Bay, film at the 'magic hour' or some specific hour for pure aesthetics, Hu Bo and cinematographer Fan Chao achieve something much more profound. The choice does make the film beautiful: every frame has this unique backdrop, a dull grey sky that also seems to be lit up in some oddly angelic way. It is not just boring and dull and bleak, it is oddly beautiful. This, of course, nicely brings in the key, and underlying, theme of hope and perpetual beauty. Even in this bleak, desolate and perpetual smog, there is a beauty you can barely put your finger on. But, of course, the main reason behind shooting at the same time is to create the numbness and monotony that defines the film's emotional register. The narrative takes place over the course of a day, with night coming at the end and giving us our one break from the same sky, but it starts to feel timeless. To watch An Elephant Sitting Still is to feel disassociated. It is a mesmerising film but it also brings you, magnetically, into its mental space. By presenting a depressive mental state through its craft, it becomes a great work of empathy, perfectly translating the subjective experience of its characters onto the screen.The music is also exceptional. Most of the film is soundtracked with ambient noise. The city because the instrument behind the action, and often feels overwhelming. The idea that it is always moving and always making noise is very important, selling the idea of the need to reach out to people. But we also become numb to it, as we develop an insular focus. At points though, the score kicks in. On a purely sonic level, it is a wonderful piece of music, but it is also the perfect thematic accompaniment. The music is built of repeating riffs and motifs that just wash over you. It sounds transcendental and beautiful but it is also undeniably numbing and repetitive. It is another part of the filmmaking that works in concert for the film's empathetic intent. But the music also builds, not as in a crescendo (though there are some) but as in adding layers. The melody remains persistent, a looping riff that lulls you, but different looping melodies from different instruments start to enter. We have synthesised sounds and plucking guitars and, at the very end, it all comes together in one of the most beautiful moments in cinema. This is when all the characters are together. You get the feeling that the repetitive rhythms each represent one of them. One of them living out a hollow, repetitive and tragic existence but, like every life, one with its own beauty (here shown through music). And when these lives come together we get something truly transcendent. This is why the ending is so hopeful and so beautiful, and the very last plot point is evoked with just a sound effect - which only adds to all of this. We may seem alone, and hopeless. We may be desperate. We may be numb to the world. It may all seem distanced and repetitive. But, when we come together and when we assist each other, we can do such wonderful things. The narrative of this film is testament to this but so is the film itself. Film is a collaborative medium and this film is a collaborative work of beauty. It is hewn from materials defined by despair, depression and loneliness but it all comes together to make something monumental. Even the length is an important part of this. The film itself becomes the elephant that is sitting still: this large and unavoidable thing determined to do one thing, much like how the film is all engineered towards one purpose. And like the whale in Werckmeister Harmonies, this stationary elephant of a film is just something larger than us that we are in awe of. That whale may be decaying and out of place, ultimately defined by tragedy, but it provides religious insight and purpose to the film's protagonist. An Elephant Sitting Still may be a film full of utter tragedy, and one in a uniform register of sadness, but it is so large, and so beautiful and so transcendent. I cannot help but be in awe of it and I left it so hopeful. Because sadness, deep and profound sadness, does exist in the world. But we can do something about that: we can connect and help each other. And this cannot be achieved if we don't recognise the sadness to begin with. This film is not a cry for help. This film is a call for action, but ultimately a message of hope. We can do better, and we need to do better, as the consequences are far too tragic.",9,an-elephant-sitting-still

There are 2 scenes that surprised me as one transmits when the protagonist enters a meeting of child trafficking with splendid cinematography (learn from this click the sound of freedom) and the other in a walk that the 2 characters have and see a fog with bars as if it held people something gloomy and what does it transmit, but the rest I have seen very linear with poetic tones but in my opinion it seems that the why of these should be explained more.What had been a realistic work, lyrical but realistic, slides towards an ostentatious symbolism at times, making it difficult to understand, and be careful that the films are made like this and it is one of these that use the sensory and of which impulse to create these, but there are also movies that pretend to have many interpretations when watching it seems one-sided, I don't know at all if this is the case, I was surprised by how much this movie was acclaimed as the best cinema in history, For the moment, I prefer the shots, sequences and camera movements that expresses it, I leave interpretations ambiguous in my opinion.",5,eternity-and-a-day

If I can, more if I have to, throw a bone towards Rocco and His Brothers for something, it's of course Alain Delon. I believe this is the first time I've seen Delon in a black and white film? I say that because it's neat how just stunning he is in that format, just about as much as he is in color. The ultimate balance of being absolutely drop-dead gorgeous and also being a very compelling actor. Maybe akin to what I said about Leslie Cheung in Farewell My Concubine, Delon is an actor I can always rely on myself enjoying to see onscreen even if said movie I'm seeing him in I didn't enjoy at all. Also nice to see Delon boxing as well, would love if that was what the full focus of this film was, but alas.

74885,"Initially intended to be part one of a six-parter, the 5½ hour Napoleon never made it to part two.  Funny that.Seriously though, this is clearly a significant piece of cinematic history, with some boundary-pushing techniques.  The Picture in Picture, jump cut, long take, fades, mobile camera, alternating focus, long zoom, filtration etc. etc. etc.Napoleon was so very technically creative for it's age nearly 100 years ago that it will likely have a place in our 'best of' lists for decades to come.However, and I feel like an uncultured swine for saying this.  I just didn't find the non-technical content very interesting.I was schooled in the UK where we covered the Napoleon story in some detail (and this is possibly even more so for my French friends).  In the entire runtime of this movie I don't feel like I really learned anything new, except that he was an ace snowball fighter and could fight pillows with the best of them.  That's a harsh view of course, as the film covers a hell of a lot of ground, so perhaps it just depends on the viewer's existing level of awareness.Abel Gance's epic is a treasure of cinema no doubt, but I found myself drifting.

22339,"Content warnings: mentions of suicide, sexual assault, rape, incest. The first 18 minutes made for an interesting set-up, I'll admit - it could've been an interesting story. But what does this film do? Dive head first into a downward spiral of becoming an absolute vile trainwreck. Indifference towards a man on the literal edge of killing himself, attempted rape with the victim apologizing to the rapist and blaming herself for defending and 'denying' herself. From there we move on to more rape, an incest backstory for the villain and a twist reveal showing us what we had previously seen was incest, too. A damsel in distress who can only be saved by the protagonist, ready to give into his every will. The treatment of women in this film is abhorrent and degrading, with no sliver of agency. And the hypnosis angle as a justification doesn't make any of this better, leaving us with a brutal void of indifference.What else is there? Oh, tons of gratuitous stylized violence which honestly failed to captivate me. Teeth pulling is a nightmare and the hallway scene wasn't nearly as great as people would have you believe. It is perfectly possible part of the reason why is because my image of Dae-su is completely marred, but how could it not be? There is no indication this film knows how to make him the least bit compelling, or complicated. It's all very straight forward and bland.The antagonist's impact was dampened immensely through the mixture of comical and cartoonish faux-deep exposition whilst trying to give him a serious and adult note through the backstory. The dream sequences didn't work for me either and the twist lost any emotional weight it could've potentially held with how it unveils more miserability, more disregard.

After her home is bombed, Veronika moves in with Boris’ parents, during which time their cousin Mark (exempt from the war draft) acts on his professed love for Veronika. Ultimately, The Cranes Are Flying boils down to a WWII-set love triangle drama from the under-represented USSR perspective, which is surprisingly not devoid of criticism aimed at the Communist regime (it’s a minor aspect of the film, but still). Whereas you (like me) might expect many back-and-forths between Veronika’s and Boris’ respective situations, it’s actually fairly focused on Veronika. Cuts to Boris mainly serve as a health status update for the viewer (not to say his scenes aren’t good, there’s simply not many of them).Veronika’s chunk of the film revolves around a brilliant scene, impressive from both an artistic and a narrative standpoint. The airstrike alarm resounds through the streets of Moscow, and Mark urges Veronika to seek shelter with him, but she, discouraged and confused by the lack of word from Boris, refuses. Mark starts playing the piano staccato over the blaring warning signal, building an airstrike-alarm-piano-concerto cacophony that ends with a bombs-are-falling crescendo, followed by Mark making his advancement towards Veronika, strobe-lighted by bomb flashes outside. It’s wholly thanks to this scene that Veronika’s sudden change of faith is given plausibility, as well as the as sudden pull-back afterwards.Part of the March 2021 March Around the World challenge; 26th out of 30 films.",5,the-cranes-are-flying

Seriously though I'm about to watch Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" and decided to watch this first as a bit of a goof because I'm just so hilarious apparently, which is nice for me. ;)I like this movie. It's your standard low budget sci-fi horror type of affair but there are some really stellar creative ideas that went in to this project that I really dig. At it's core it is a merging of two of sci-fi's most celebrated sub genre's; giant monster movies and post-apocalyptic movies. This film has great lore and it's given to us in a way that doesn't feel ham-fisted. In fact, almost everything in this movie is very purposeful and well set up. There are a few bizarre scenes that serve no purpose but they're few and far in between. They also do a very good job of making the titular parasite feel alive however despite their efforts it stll feels very limited. The film looks pretty good too, not fantastic but servicable. In that same vein the performances are just ok. The sets work for what they're going for but it just looks like a rundown town.

14598,"I'm completely torn on this one.  On the one hand, the look of this film is marvelous.  The sets and locations are stunning.  The cinematography and camera work are nearly one of a kind.  The score by Philip Glass is wonderful as well.  The music really adds to the final product and feels like it was born alongside the film.  Finally there is the structure of the film.  This is a bio-pick, and typically this type of story is told in a very linear and straightforward style.  What director Paul Schrader does here is to use passages from the books Mishima wrote, and use those to look back on the life of the artist.  The result is a creative and potentially ""truer"" look at a man than what could be told in a pint-by-numbers bio-pick.On the other hand, content has to count for something, and I just wasn't feeling the story of this film.  I have no connection to Mishima prior to this movie, and I don't think a person should need to ""do homework"" before seeing a film.  But I'm afraid that I still don't know much of the man.  The artistic flair in the movie made it interesting to look at and listen to, but the separated me from the man himself.  I know what the movie showed me about Mishima, but much of that could have been emotion or feeling, not reality.  Therefore I was never sure what was real and what wasn't.In the end I enjoyed having the experience of watching this movie, but I don't think I will be returning to it anytime soon.  Also I really don't have much interest in researching the subject.  I'm not sure if that is the movies fault, or if I am just a bad viewer.",5,mishima-a-life-in-four-chapters
54386,"Few films demonstrate a filmmaker's utter dearth of inspiration, and exhaustion of purpose, following an unmitigated masterpiece, as Theo Angelopoulos's Weeping Meadow.  There is one specific moment that is a perfect example of my problems with it.  The camera is tracking a couple walking towards something offscreen, and they appropriately stare past the audience, in the director's usual, plodding, measured long take.  The landscape is flat, with no obstructions in their path, and the characters walk slowly, transfixed by something ahead of them that they should clearly be able to see.  After a few minutes, I suppose, when Angelopoulos decides that the audience has suffered enough in this shot, the camera gets out of their way, and turns to frame them in profile, right before including a large tree on the left side of the screen, with dead animals hanging from many of the branches.  On perfect cue, the female character becomes physically affected by the sight, and starts sobbing, at the exact point the audience sees what she has been seeing all along, for nearly five minutes where she remained unaffected.  This is the definition of style over substance, of a filmmaker indulging his vision and aesthetic preferences to the subordination of character and story, but in cases like this, it's far more egregious than when the common criticism is levied Hollywood blockbusters.  Because here there is a pretense of mining deep truths and revealing aspects of the human condition, through decades of war and character displacement.  The entire film is like this, all carefully, deliberately staged wide shot long takes, dwarfing characters who are shortchanged at every turn of  displaying actual emotion through the director's diorama of human suffering.  This approach works to great effect in Angelopoulos's Eternity And A Day, where the fixed perspective of Alexandre allows the visual style to become an extension of his character.  But in the aid of an omniscient narrative, that covers a span of decades, with multiple characters the approach fails, and comes across as a shoehorn from a director basking in the glow of his Palme d'Or win. and feeling like he has to do more of the same.  I'm not kidding when I say that The Weeping Meadow makes Bela Tarr films seem positively thrilling.

In some way it’s very gentle and when the music starts it becomes out of nowhere very emotional. Especially the guy who played the sun, really became the sun itself, he is completely in his role. Although Tarr never cuts here, he manages to show close-ups, varying angles, and establishing shots by elegantly transitioning from one to another. The rest of the film doesn’t quite live up to the majesty of this opening sequence, but it hardly falters either. Enchanting, hypnotic, dark, oppressive, surreal, sad, extremely slow, and a very bleak metaphysical exploration of the state of humanity is how you can best describe this film. Beautiful black and white cinematography (imo more perfected than in Satantango) and an even better soundtrack make Werckmeister Harmonies an unforgettable hypnotic experience.",8,werckmeister-harmonies

There’s an incredibly brutal death, a wild orgy, and a dude who shoots himself in the head on the street, but by the end, this became a courtroom melodrama. How can a movie be so dull with Rutger Hauer, Gene Hackman, Pesci, Mickey Rourke, Joe Spinell, and a bunch of others? This is how.

20049,"A glacially paced, beautifully shot, morally simplistic and philosophically underdeveloped fable, ‘Shansho the Bailiff’ failed to engage me on any level whatsoever. The biggest failing for me was certainly in the character and story department. You just never get an emotional bearing on the people or story we are watching. Characters just react to things that happen for most of the film, with only the beginning and ending having characters tangibly demonstrate their worldviews or core beliefs. On paper, the story sounds pretty great, but as is, I just never got a sense of the significance or severity of Zushiō’s moral lapse, nor Anju’s resolve. I think this is in part due to the filmmaking also. Almost every scene is shot at distance from the characters to facilitate the long takes Mizoguchi is renown for, and it just didn’t work for me. I felt far too removed from the human aspect of the story, and while definitely well composed and choreographed, the low energy and unvaried images certainly became rather tedious for me.I’m beginning to think this era of Japanese Humanist fables are just not for me as every one I have seen has left me rather bored, and even the one I did like (Ikiru), I was not that wild about it.",2,sansho-the-bailiff

29593,"For a good part of its runtime, this was a very conflicting film. There are overt strengths and while it doesn’t always succeed with what it is trying to do, it is trying something sincere. And then the ending came, which is atrocious and cements the film’s issues. This is a film about people trying to get by despite the wider, horrific context, and thus it is blind to a lot of it. However, there comes a point where these things are inescapable, and the film shies away from this. The answer to fascism here is endearing but naive, and reductionist. It is a film in need of a shift to brutal reality - to do some justice to a brutal reality - and it does not do this at all. It takes an easy way out and avoids the important issues. It is a perfect foil to the successes of Pan’s Labyrinth, which so perfectly demonstrates the desire to escape and to shield, but how you fundamentally cannot do this. This film, with its tone and final moments especially, presents the argument that we can push through fascism with naivety, positivity and innocence - that life is beautiful and that humanity overcomes inhumanity. This is cute but feels fundamentally false - and does pave over genuine harm. It diminishes the actuality of oppression, showcasing dangerous behaviour. All the film really needed to do was to be a film of two distinct halves: showing the optimism and joy, and humanity (the beauty of life), and then how this is crushed by inhumanity. This would be a more impactful critique of actual fascism. What is very telling is that this film is consistently uplifting and never devastating - and it should be the latter. The first half is wonderful, it is a joy to watch and is very funny. The central performance is a delight, though reaches too far at points, and the heights of this half would be the perfect juxtaposition to necessary lows in a bleaker second movement. Alas, the tone continues throughout and we are left with the point that life can be a game, that it is fundamentally beautiful, and this is achieved through artifice. Even the great first half doesn’t feel real, a man doing wild stunts that exist in a world devoid of consequence. Well, a consequence does come, but it is a singular one that exists irrespective of his actions. The film also presents a limited lens of WW2. There is an evasion of a wider critique of fascism, especially Italian fascism, due to a focus on the Holocaust. This, of course, merits a focus but the focus itself is insufficient.There is greatness here, and heart - and the first hour has moments of genius - but as a whole it results in something incredibly naive, about a topic that demands much more.",3,life-is-beautiful

29620,"A surprising critical and commercial success, Life Is Beautiful achieved the grand jury prize at the 51st Cannes Film Festival, three Academy Awards, and numerous other prestigious accolades. It is best described as a fable rather than a slice of historical realism and presumably intended to acknowledge the power of innocence, imagination and love in the most harrowing circumstances. Written and directed by Italian comedian Roberto Benigni, it observes Jewish father Guido Orefice (Benigni) and his young son, Giosuè (Giorgio Cantarini), imprisoned in a concentration camp during World War II. The film unfolds to spotlight a progression of coincidences and untruths as Guido insulates his son from existence in the camp by assuring him that it is all a game. Unfortunately, it proved to be the final film by Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli, who enjoyed a distinguished career and worked with several acclaimed directors, including Sergio Leone and Federico Fellini. The awful truth of the mass scale slaughter is portrayed from being incredibly soft-focus to unrealistic as Guido's lies regarding the genocide become increasingly bizarre, far-fetched and unbelievable. Ultimately, Benigni's excessively sentimental fantasy trivialises the Holocaust and diminishes the suffering of its victims.",3,life-is-beautiful

43552,"I would be willing to audit a class - let's say a one-time seminar instead, actually - that explains why Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" is one of the great works of literature. I mean I get why in general, but an analytical breakdown of its significance would interest me. Maybe especially now after watching over 3 hours of its American film adaptation and coming out the other end none the wiser. If there wasn't a ""War and Peace"" book, I'd be convinced this movie was Hollywood's idea of a ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""Farewell to Arms"" cash-in during their '50s panic of ""please don't forget about cinema on account of your brand new TV sets"" epic-strewn desperation. It's about war during the time of Napoleon, and women waiting for their soldier suitors back home and unspoken love and the tragedy of combat and it's completely uninvolving. Some of the set designs were nice, like bleak wintery backdrops. Audrey Hepburn's cute as a button. Henry Fonda is ever so sincere. America didn't need to make this movie that's about Russian history and culture. I'm sure the many-part 1966 Russian film series version has all the answers I seek, but I'm ""War and Peace""d out now. I should've watched that one instead, but I was intrigued by the hubris of this would-be King Vidor masterpiece that has all but vanished from the annals of movie history.

72747,"I know Nicholas Roeg has a great reputation but I'd not yet seen any of his films.  Perhaps ""Eureka"" was not the best intro to his work.  While I was impressed by the stunning photography and editing of many sequences (the opening scenes around the discovery of gold in the cold harsh Alaskan wilderness, the orgiastic voodoo dance scene, the brutal murder by blowtorch), I found myself bored and distracted by the showmanship which seemed to overwhelm the story.The theme of how wealth (here, gold) corrupts and corrodes those who possess it is reminiscent of the silent Von Stroheim classic ""Greed"" and Paul Thomas Anderson's later ""There Will Be Blood"" (which clearly was influenced by this).  But it was hard to relate to or empathize with any of the characters, all of whom seem to be used for their symbolic purpose and many of whom (the alcoholic wife, the daughter who escapes her father's control by becoming sexually obsessed with her lover, the gangsters) are not fully developed.  Certainly there is plenty of acting talent: Gene Hackman, Theresa Russell, Rutger Hauer, Joe Pesci and a surprisingly young and handsome Mickey Rourke).  But that didn't sustain my interest either.What I did find fascinating is that this is based on an actual unsolved murder case in 1943, and a later Internet search got me immersed in the story of Sir Harry Oakes, the character on which Hackman's Jack McGann is based.  But the film itself was laden with archetypes, visual kaleidoscopes  and mystical symbolism at the expense of what could have been a fascinating story.

In order to understand the plot, one must really understand the Greek political history from the 1920s to the late 1940s, which I absolutely do not. I relied greatly on the IMDb synopsis page, which explains things that are not even remotely explained in the film (why was Eleni imprisoned twice??)The film focuses so greatly on the expansive timeline of this family that it completely breaks from character development altogether. The two main actors have no chemistry together or character depth at all, and Eleni essentially cries throughout the entire film.My distaste for this movie really has nothing to do with the direction, but the lack of story and character writing that is essential to such a long, emotionally tormenting movie.",3,the-weeping-meadow

15573,"'Incendies' starts brilliantly. Its first few minutes suggest that we are about to witness something truly great. We see a group of children having their heads shaved as in the background plays Radiohead's  ' You and Whose Army'. It's a striking opening scene that establishes a very ominous tone. Unfortunately nothing else that follows achieves this same level of stark power. Denis Villeneuve's drama about terror organisations and nationalistic repression is self consciously important and overly dramatic. Villeneuve insists upon having his characters constantly deliver extremely portentous dialogue and it just feels heavy handed and false. It's a film that wants to repeatedly bash the viewer around the head to illustrate its point. And yet ironically it refuses to fully explain itself or develop key details. We never really get to know much about Jeanne or Simon due to a considerable lack of well rounded characterisation. This absence of insight means that the viewer is always kept at a distance from the content. It also refuses to provide much historical context and assumes that the audience understands the finer details. Without necessary context we are alienated from the drama and given a very simplistic view of terror organisations that tells the viewer nothing that they don't know already - that these groups are threatening and malevolent. At the same time Villeneuve still has plenty of tiresome scenes where a character explains the plot, and for a film that wants to show it still does a lot of telling. The problem with presenting such a bleak and harsh dramatisation is that it can simply numb you into submission when there is nothing to latch onto. For a film that should be powerful and affecting it feels strangely empty and ultimately is the equivalent of an overbearing lecture on the suppression of  human rights and terrorism.",3,incendies

40129,"Film #66 that was recommended to me -- feel free to add to the list! (Recommended by alex todd 🧟‍♂️)Oops.Sometimes I wonder if my opinions on films are just directly correlated to how much I like/agree with underlying themes. As much as I wanted to appreciate The 400 Blows more, this does demonstrate that my aesthetic preferences can override themes, at least in one direction. This film is making a lot of good moves: it centers on a child who is undeniably a bit of a pain, while seeking to understand the environment he 's been subjected to. As a child, you spend most of your time being passed from authority figure to authority figure, subject to all of their rules, whether reasonable or not. It can be stifling. I myself was largely too much of a nice, rule-following kid; if anything I've grown to be disappointed in my own conformity and anxiety at times, heh. But even I recall the capricious, arbitrary nature of rule enforcement. My single ""problem"" was just being loud, never intentionally, but I guess my voice was noisy and I liked to say things. It was enough that I have plenty of elementary school memories of being in trouble for misdeeds I didn't even understand, and multiple instances of being blamed for things I genuinely did not do. Once labelled a ""problem child"" in some way, the label sticks. I can relate to Antoine -- the film understands what childhood is like.Antoine's issues run a lot deeper; it's true that he acts out worse and with a little more intention, but he is dealing with particularly abusive authorities. They aren't one-dimensional evil, but it's clear that a lot of people really just don't want to deal with him anymore, and probably never did. If you treat a kid like they're doing the worst things regardless of what they do, why wouldn't they just do those things?That's all excellent -- but, taking a step back, why would I watch The 400 Blows? Ignoring the fact that I'm an uneducated film philistine if I don't, hah. It's nice to relate to a character and reflect on my own life, yes, but it's just mirroring thoughts I've always had. Authorities often stifle childhood energy for shaky reasons and don't care enough about the children's feelings, or fail to allow them enough space to feel like autonomous beings. And yeah, it's not all black and white, kids are exhausting, people have their own lives full of stresses and worries, and through some logic these adults usually think they're helping kids grow up. I'm not saying it isn't valuable to put all of this to film, just that I didn't notice any particularly special, unique insights, little to chew on beyond what a quick read of the premise would reveal.Even that is just fine; there are plenty of fabulous films that aren't exactly revealing the esoteric secrets of the universe, but at that point, we need to feel. Therein lies my real problem: I feel next to nothing here. Despite a constant parade of injustices, The 400 Blows is subtle and understated. There's a fine line to not becoming overdone and melodramatic, and obviously my experiences aren't universal, but it just doesn't grab me; I think we've done much better with the topic since. The whole of film criticism exists to tell you why this is groundbreaking in 1959, so I'll be the unfair guy to come out and compare it to decades of later filmmaking. Look at Where is My Friend's House?, the unwillingness of adults to listen to children in that film is so frustrating as to be nearly unbearable. Or try Moonrise Kingdom, certainly a very different film, but it captures the exuberance of childhood in moments of breaking away from the constraints of the adult world so beautifully. Welcome, or No Trespassing covers the same authoritarian discipline of children (and, when I looked back, caused me to write about the same memories) in a more satirical way to both amuse and highlight the absurd, pathetic nature of much of it. I could go on, but listing movies for pages isn't a good use of my or your time. The point I want all this to make is that The 400 Blows is a film of good ideas that only feels like the bare minimum treatment of them. It shows us these social issues from a child's perspective but, at least for me, can only present the problems on the surface, not taking anything a step further to really comment or probe into the emotional core. I don't feel like I have any use for it.",4,the-400-blows
77808,"Poorly PlannedI assume the title, ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days,"" given that we're never informed of such an exact length of pregnancy for the character seeking an illegal abortion, instead refers to how long this yet another example of slow cinema is intended to seem to last, or to mimic the countdown one might perform waiting for the torment to cease.  The only thing missing is the Oxford comma; I mean, slow down already.Seriously, though, try as I might, I find this artsy European film festival style to be so very, repetitively dull.  It's not even that this one is especially excruciating compared to the rest in its pacing despite a bloated average shot length according to counts on the cinemetrics website of somewhere between 80 and 94 seconds (an unusually wide disparity in the range of the counts, by the way, for which I also feel the urge to joke is due the counters having fallen asleep from the boredom of it).  That's probably because scenes tend to consist of either tracking shots or lots of talking, so for the non-Romanian speaker at least, the image is usually shifting one way or the other, from camera movement or from new subtitles, even if the characters and narrative aren't doing much of anything.  A classic of the style, for comparison, ""Jeanne Dielman"" (1975) has an average shot length of a little over 50 seconds, but it's a lot longer, a lot quieter, and fewer dramatic things happen, so it seems slower.  Either that or I'm just getting more used to these arthouse flicks.Minimal style is one thing, too, but when combined with minimal content, I fail to see the reason in the characteristically raving reviews from critics these films attract.  Even though I sought out this one precisely for its subject matter, with the recent overturning of Roe v. Wade in the United States, just because a movie is about abortion doesn't alone make it compelling--particularly if, like me, one doesn't come from the André Bazin school of vaunted realism.  Regardless, this is basically about the difficulties of two young women submitting to patriarchal pressure from everyone from a boyfriend, his family, old man complaining about disrespectful youths included, an abortionist, and the communist regime.  About the only part I liked was when the protagonist says to not speak any more of their ordeal, the movie ends.Otherwise, this isn't even excellent of its kind.  Some of the tracking shots are especially ugly, and one of the uglier aspects of the story is shockingly shown whereas another isn't.  There is no score to help build any tension, as there tends not to be with this style, although it doesn't fetishize the soundscape like others do--probably because there's relatively so much more talking.  ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always"" (2020), but badly made.  Poor planning all around, from the characters with their unprotected sex and procrastination on the abortion, to the slow cinema style, and including the central planning of repressive communist Romania.Say what you will about oppressive communist regimes, too, but filmmakers under the first one, back in the USSR--Kuleshov, Eisenstein, Vertov, etc.--they appreciated the power of montage for cinematic engagement with their polemics.  Speaking of which, I'll rewatch ""Bed and Sofa"" (1927) and see what I can find of the film, titled among other things, ""Misery and Fortune of Woman"" (1930), for contrast of two other films that handled the abortion issue.",3,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days

36407,"Part of my Double Feature Challenge (2)We've watched Apurba Kumar Ray from his birth in rural Bengal through the death of everyone in his immediate family. That includes the passing of his elderly cousin Indir and his sister Durga in Nischindipur, his father's death in Benares, and the loss of his mother in Mansapota. We saw Apu grow from country nobody to clever street urchin to talented student and college academic. At the end of Part Two of the ""Apu Trilogy,"" we saw our main character say goodbye to Uncle Bhabataran, the last of his kin, to take his exams in Calcutta.Part Three of writer-director Satyajit Ray's saga opens with a recommendation letter from a Calcutta professor introducing Apu (Soumitra Chatterjee) as ""sensitive, conscientious and diligent."" The professor is upset that Apu is leaving without completing his degree, but funds have run out and, behind three months in rent, Apu needs to get a full-time job.  And that's not easy. His only income is private tutoring for 15 rupees a month. An elementary school would hire him to teach, but they pay only 10 rupees a month and his rent is seven. A manufacturer would hire him, but piecework labeling little bottles is far below his qualification level. And a job with the railroad seems promising, till it turns out to be strike-breaking, which Apu won't participate in.When old school chum and former engineering student Pulu (Swapan Mukherjee) stops by to invite Apu to a wedding in rural Khulna, the unemployed debtor has no excuse to say ""no."" But he's less enthusiastic about Pulu's offer to introduce him to a clerking job for 45 rupees a month. One of Apu's short stories was just been accepted for publication by a magazine, and he somehow fancies himself a starving writer, working on a major novel and on the verge of instant fame.At Khulna, Apu is introduced to Pulu's aunt and uncle, his cousin Murari (Abhijit Chatterjee) and the bride-to-be, cousin Aparna (Sharmila Tagore). By the time the groom's procession with its musical ensemble makes it's way toward the wedding venue, Apu has fallen fast asleep under a tree with a thick book beneath his head for a pillow. He would miss the ceremony altogether, except for one thing ... there isn't one!The groom, whom none of Pulu's family had ever met, turns out to be stark-raving mad... a complete nut case. Aparna's mother refuses to allow the wedding to proceed but, by Hindu tradition, if she doesn't marry before the end of the day, she'll be considered ""spoiled"" and not worthy of any man. That's when Pulu proposes a solution -- Apu can marry Aparna that evening and all will be fine.Apu's immediate reaction to this proposal is obvious. But when he sees the jilted groom, and thinks about the clerking job, perhaps realizing he is totally impoverished and alone in the world now, the would-be author decides to play the role of white knight. If Pulu can get him a clean shirt and a shave, he'll marry his cousin and save the day. Or as Aparna's auntie puts it, he turns the curse into a blessing.The wedding night, however, is more of a curse. Apu knows nothing of women. And Aparna knows nothing of Apu, except he's alone, likes to write and plays the flute. Suddenly, Apu realizes what he's got himself into -- penniless, unemployed and wholly unready to be a husband. Being noble is no solution. Still, Aparna says she's ready, to be poor if need be.Compared to the lavishness of Aparna's country home, Apu's walk-up apartment is a filthy hovel. While he retrieves the luggage, she sits down to have a good cry, only now beginning to understand how poor ""poor"" can be. But one good thing -- the neighbors take an immediate liking to her. **** CAUTION - POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD ****Apu and Aparna start as strangers, but they soon come to like each other. As a country girl, she is not as weak or sheltered as Apu might have imagined. She enjoys his company, learns English from him, and prepares their meals using a charcoal burner. Aparna is thrifty, too. When she gets pregnant and returns to Khulna to be with her mother for the birth, he gets lonely and counts the days till he can take time off from work to be with her. He reads her misspelled love letters over and over.And then there's Murari, waiting for him at home after work one evening. It's bad news. No, terrible news. Aparna died in childbirth. In a fit of anger, Apu strikes the messenger. Apu takes to bed and refuses to get up. We learn through a neighbor that the baby lived. Feeling the need to be free of everything, Apu takes to the road, bringing along his manuscript and little else. Alone in nature, Apu finds some solace -- the beauty of woods, leaves and sunsets. He discards his manuscript and disappears... for five years.Meanwhile, Apu's son is growing up wild and mischievous without parents. His grandmother has passed away, and his grandfather finds him a handful, uncontrollable. Pulu, who has been working abroad, decides to seek out Apu. He finds him at a mining camp and confronts him about his duty as a father. But Apu says he has sent money three times. That's the most he can do. He wasn't even aware of his son's name, Kajal. And deep inside, Apu blames Kajal for Aparna's death. He just can't face the boy.But Pulu's visit triggered something, and we see Apu arrive at Khulna, surprising his father-in-law. He also surprises Kajal, who awakes from a nap, takes one look at this bearded vagabond and runs away. When Apu follows him, saying ""I'm your father,"" the boy tosses a rock at him. Attempts to win his affection with a toy train and offers of storytelling fail, too. The kid wants nothing to do with this stranger. And the father-in-law has no use for him either.I must say, I guessed how the director would end this, and I was not disappointed. Some things just have to happen in an Indian movie, and leaving a a huge loose end isn't one of them. The film received a BAFTA nomination for Best Film from Any Source, and it won the National Board of Review Award for Best Foreign Film. I still think Part One was the best of the three, but this is a close second. You really need to see them all, preferably without letting too much time pas between viewings.",7,apur-sansar
4477,"Kubrick noted that Spielberg's Holocaust film isn't about 6 million Jews who died but 600 Jews who lived.Imagine that you receive what would be today a $51 million budget to make an epic about the Holocaust, and you choose to make the movie about a benevolent Nazi. Specifically, a Nazi whose motivation is to make a fortune from exploiting the labor of a population facing mass extermination, who gains his heart along the way. Of course, the important narrative to tell about the Holocaust is precisely the opposite, a story of a bunch of normal, everyday 'good' Germans who participated in oppression, surveillance, and mass murder.There are an endless number of stories about heroic Jews who resisted, saved hundreds of lives, or even just worked to keep families together and life bearable against the reality of knowing they were marked for certain death. Spielberg shows them no interest.Okay, so you wanted to make a film about Oskar Schindler instead. Fine. That's your prerogative, I guess. But if you're going to make a movie about genocide, at the very least you need to give the victims depth and humanity. Spielberg fails almost entirely on this front, as the Jewish actors serve as little more than props and stereotypes. You're depicting the great dehumanization event of modernity and failing to humanize that group in that process.The shower scene is appallingly offensive. Kubrickian suspense about what substance is going to be released from the showerhead, and we get to take a deep breath when it's water. Just genuinely gross emotional manipulation.Schindler's List is a comfort film for American audiences - a melodrama about how things were really bad but there was a good German who did his part. Evil is a matter of aesthetics and metaphysical evil, not a result of any tangible political proscriptions. If you knew literally nothing about the Holocaust prior to watching the movie, you wouldn't even know why Jews were being killed. It has some nice cinematography, a good score, high drama, and character development for our non-Jewish protagonist. And of course, the film finishes with a happy endingUltimately I think there is one essential question to ask about Schindler's list: what do we learn about the Holocaust from watching it? The fact that this question doesn't have an obvious answer (or in my view any answer at all) is a devastating indictment.",1,schindlers-list
21523,"The Ascent  is a tough film for me because I really liked certain aspects, like the question of how far one is willing to go for survival and if a clear conscience is more important than life itself or if living with the guilt of what you've done is even living at all but the religious allegory and very thin characters made for not much to hold onto as the film progressed.  The way certain shots were filmed was also really interesting and engaging, some were fourth wall-breaky and some, like the beginning rush away from enemy soldiers were very  Saving Private Ryan  esque while others were just brilliant for how unconventional yet gorgeous they were (see the poster I picked for maybe my favorite shot)The main issue is that I was left as emotionally cold as the harsh landscape. I didn't really connect with or care about the fate of anyone and felt like there was a vast distance to what I should have been feeling and what I did feel, which was nothing. Intellectually I was interested but I wanted to actually experience the plight and couldn't. A personal preference as I often have this issue with films that are too cerebral without having enough of a plot or early investment in character to really show how they change over time and the film clearly choosing a side of which character was in the right instead of letting them exist in the gray zone between also detracted overall from what it was trying to say. I would love to have seen where director Larisa Shepitko would have gone had her life not been cut tragically short at 41 as there's a ton of craft on display here and maybe with a different story the emotional aspects would have reached the heights of the technical.

I was engaged in the movie for most of the runtime and impressed by the quality of it, but it still never really blew me away. The first half of the movie had a lot of talking and we saw the characters finding and hiring the samurais, while the second half was full of battles against the bandits. The battle scenes were great and very well made, but given the fact that this is a samurai movie I kinda expected some cool 1 v 1 sword fighting too, which we never really got.

8444,"Like a child being tasked with sitting and thinking about what they've done, I had to let Autumn Sonata swish around my brain. Initially, I was enraptured by the orange hues whenever Ingrid Bergman was not present in the house. And outside of the initial reintroduction of mother and daughter and the tense piano-playing scene, I was disappointed by how bland the home scenes were lit, in comparison. I also found many of the mother-daughter arguments to be too cruel. But, like evading a heated argument, I didn't let those feelings escalate; I slept on it and woke up with much deeper perspective.We are introduced to Liv Ullman's Eva as she writes in the background and her husband speaks for her; he talks of the two books she wrote in the past, and how she wrote of having no concept of herself. ""I'd like to tell her just for once that she is loved whole-heartedly but I can't say it in such a way that she'd believe me. I can't find the right words,"" he says. Eva's surroundings are almost hospital-like. She's chosen to become a nurturer and she's given herself the narrative that that nurturing was necessary because her sister was ill and she blamed her mother for her sister's illness. She has a tenderness about her sister but it is perhaps tied to both hating their mother. Eva was a creative but once she determined that she had no concept of herself, that she groped blindly, she became a caretaker. Taking on her sister's illness lifted the void of self, but that void came back when her mother visits.We are introduced to Charlotte (Ingrid Bergman) in an actual hospital, with her second husband on his deathbed. Eva's existence, the home, looks more like a hospital, however, as it's taken the guise of a care-taking facility. Charlotte, though she's in a hospital, is framed at the magical hour of sunset, the room aflame with orange hues and dark shadows. When Charlotte visits her daughter for the first time, she is unaware that she is visiting both daughters, having not seen either for 5 years and she believe the ill and bedridden Helena to be living in a facility.Upon arrival, Charlotte's mood is quite airy, particularly for someone who just lost a loved one. And Eva's reception of her mother is also free and loving—until the first wound is opened. That is in mentioning that Helena lives there too, and thus, Charlotte's reunion is now double in physical presence but immensely magnified in emotional weight. We see Charlotte pause and we judge her immensely for desiring to not see Helena. Eva likewise judges Charlotte for not being depressed from her recent loss.These judgements are key. Bergman is setting us up to hate Charlotte, by showing a negligent mother, a careerist who frequently left her children to pursue her own fame, an egoist, and someone who seems to have no deep emotional connection to her family nor her husband. These are all surface judgements. And during the piano scene, Bergman shows us a woman who corrects her daughter's playing as being overly sentimental and not dark enough. Again, we are being set up for a portrait of a wretch.By the end of Autumn Sonata, I felt for Charlotte and I ended up detesting Eva during her mother's visit. I started feeling that way when Eva blamed Charlotte for Helena's sickness, for her worsening condition but that subsided when her mother left, and Eva re-centered into her accepted role. Grudges that are held for so long twist and reshape into an ugly and unpredictable monster. I've witnessed that in my family, particularly my sister, with whom I had to teach her the word ""empathy"" because she thought it meant ""pity."" But you can't really teach empathy. Eva, in my opinion, used Helena's condition as a way to distance herself from her own pain and personhood and then turned a longing to be close to her mother into a hatred for her mother. Accusing her of being more interested in her work than in nurturing. Eva gave up on being an artist in order to take on the nurturing role. And disdain was born from that.My mother also worked hours that kept her away from home during a lot of my childhood. But as a boy, I craved attention from my father and I ended up becoming closer to my mom as an adult because my father had never been available even though he was present. Because my attention was not focused on her it made it much easier to get to know her as an adult and see what similarities we have. This would not have been possible had I actively sought her emotional support like the two daughters here. Indeed, I just recently saw my father for the first time in five years, just a few months ago. And that narrative of hurt sprung from the desire for his attention and approval that I did not get as a kid. However, I still had empathy for him. And the visit, though I was nervous beforehand, went find. Eva lost her ability to have empathy for her mother because she views nurturing as necessary for women. It's a failure from which Charlotte will never recover. My father is saved by his gender because we concede that it's impossible for many, if not most, men to be incapable of providing the emotional support we want of them.Charlotte is an accomplished artist. She is not infallible because of this, for her inability to see Helena shows how the desire to be amongst beauty has pushed her away from more difficult emotions. But Sven Nykvist's lighting is key to understanding her motives. When alone, or without her daughters, Ingrid Bergman is always lit in the most lush and autumnal hues; it's a pure visual splendor. To me, it shows how her creative side puts her into an entirely different world, where every texture is enhanced, every movement of light is perceived and felt. And Eva's nurturing side is shown as cold, lacking reverie, and without personality. While it easiest to look at the surface of Autumn Sonata as a mother who has wronged her daughters, to me, this feels like Ingmar Bergman using color to express his marital failures and perhaps parenting failures through his desire to not be present with them but with his art. And through Eva, in my opinion, he accepts guilt from this and accepts all emotional burdens that his absence has created. The way he seems to make the audience side with Eva from the outset seems to show that he is not making an excuse and is deserving of any negative sentiment. But the ending, following Charlotte as she runs from her familial problems and back to the road, shows the visual splendor in which she lives and it's evident why she'd prefer to be away, if this is how the world opens up to her without the need of being reassured through actions of love, just shown in a poem, played on a piano, projected onto a screen. I suppose what I'm saying is that I have empathy for her. And I do for Eva, too. For a movie that feels close to Haneke in its argumentative sections, it's pretty remarkable to end with empathy for both. And I think that's only possible due to the working relationship between Bergman and Nykvist; never has a chamber play built such a distinct interplay between the internal and the external; how nurturing moves us further from ourselves and how creativity moves us further from those we love. One attached to memory, the other attached to detachment for the lust for life it affords. That’s my take. There are many takes, but that one was mine.Watched for Film School Dropouts' Week 31 — Cinematographer — Sven Nykvist",8,autumn-sonata

40576,"In my terribly mediocre write up of Metropolis I described the movie's music as ""tender"", which was a foolish mistake. The score in general is bombastic, epic, tension-filled and so much more. When I used the word tender I was specifically reffering to ""Freder And Maria"" a romantic piece that truth be told is one of the most tender themes out there and in a way it is the key into making Metropolis hopeful(my idiotic ass assumed that people who had seen the movie would understand what I was talking about). We can hear the theme at the most important moments of the film, moments of love and romance that create the happy ending. But in M there is none of that. There is no romantic theme, in fact there is no music at all, only silence and the murderer's whistle. I don't even think Metropolis is an expressionistic movie either, there are of course moments of expressionism in it but it's mostly a terrifying blend of sc-fi and surrealism. It is in M where Lang gives birth the film noir genre by expressionism, by embrrassing the darkness. Metropolis is a horror movie until its ending, but M is a horror movie until its very last moment. Metropolis comforts us by being set in a vague point in the future, M is set in reality that feels awfully familiar. In Metropolis parents forget their children into a city that is literally flooding, but Freder and Maria save them, in M there is no Freder and Maria, there is Hana Beckert. Lang was a man that could see the future, he knew what was coming, M is a movie that literally predicts the rise of nazism, the downfall of privacy and the holocaust. We can talk all day about its higly innonative camerawork and Lorre's outstanding perfomance but I think that I need to  mention one more thing: Lang knew that humanity eats itself, and will eternally continue to do so, which makes M today one of the depressing and scary movies one can see.

29703,"This is a film that I wanted to think on a little bit before reviewing, as my thoughts were pretty muddled while watching it. However all that time has revealed to me is that I stand by my gut instinct; I really don't like Life is Beautiful. The film is a comedy-drama which sees Jewish-Italian Guido and his son sent to a Nazi concentration camp, where Guido uses his comedy and light spirit to try and protect his son's innocence. Essentially, he is trying to use comedy as a weapon against the horrors of the Holocaust. This is an interesting idea, but one that requires a very delicate and skillful touch that this film doesn't have. Actually, it takes a while for the Holocaust material to manifest. The first half focuses on Guido's efforts to woo the woman who will become his wife. This section of the film's sentimentality and sense of humour did not work for me at all. I found Roberto Benigni's performance as Guido to be particularly annoying. He's just a very over the top and cartoony figure who I find extremely grating. I'm sure he was inspired by the comedy actors of the silent era like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, but he just doesn't have their spark and in truth I don't know if such a style works in modern day filmmaking. I'm not fond of the first half, but a lot of that is a result of taste and I probably wouldn't have been so harsh on the film had it remained a sentimental love story, but the second half sees Guido and his son faced with the horrors of a concentration camp. I get that the comedy is supposed to be meant less for laughs and more as a means of preserving humanity in the face of evil, but I found it to highly offensive. Seeing Guido jump around like a clown or complain about heavy the anvils he's forced to carry are amidst the background of genuine human tragedy and the horror's of mankind struck me as being in very poor taste and I felt myself tangibly uncomfortable through the entire second half. Part of the problem is that the comedy style is quite broad. Had the humour came off as subtle and minimal I could have got behind it, but instead it mostly consists of Guido being loud and obnoxious. The film also has a pretty light tone, in spite of the subject matter, and the end result has the holocaust portrayed as an absurd joke. The whole thing just made me feel uncomfortable, and not in a way that was intended.I get the arguments for this film. That it is a fable and is not meant to be taken literarily, but as an ode to the human spirit and its efforts to fight evil anyway it can. That's all well and good but the actual execution is not endearing and inspiring, but offensive and sickening. I'll give the film credit for the production, score, cinematography, and because I do think Benigni had his heart in the right place. But I also can't deny how wrong this made me feel. I'm usually not one to say there are some things you don't joke about, but in this case it's an accurate statement.",2,life-is-beautiful
8090,"I have some explaining to do.This film has a tremendously high rating, which I fundamentally do not understand. From the very first scene, I knew that this film pushed over a line that the series never did. But I was willing to give it a shot. About halfway through I was on board, I was ready for the movie to make up for the horrible tv ending. But I was wrong. This is some of the most pretentious, annoying, and frustrating pieces of media I have ever watched. The main character is one of the worst written ever, being extremely annoying and redundant, turning some emotional drama into angst-y whining. There is so many awkward, or even offensive sexual scenes, that made emotional scenes weird wish fulfillment. Why would the mother figure decide to kiss his surrogate son in that way? Why would you keep the scene where a clone 14 year old gets fingered? It is straight up disgusting. And just like the series, the film ends with some of the most pretentious montages ever, overusing establishing shots and bafflingly using real life footage where a guy looks into the camera and gives a thumbs up. Like, does the film think I am stupid? Worst even, it’s depiction of depression is insulting. Every character gives the worst advice possible, and then proceed to question why the main character is crying all the time. Sure the animation is great at times, but the squandering of characters, theme and plot for the sake of a director to complain about his own life makes some of the miserable experiences I have had watching a film.

When you go to look up this film online, there's a ton of shit about it being a feminist storyline from awful late-stage capitalist organizations, and I legit cannot fathom even that interpretation given what happens. It's some fucking cop being told everything she has to do by two old white guys, and the one piece of intel she gets on her own turns out to already be known by all the other people in the film when it comes up. And then the film concludes with her gunning down (not gonna touch on how awful her policework is in this just yet) a trans person. Hannibal Lector tells you they are not trans, sure, but why does some fucking psychiatrist get to tell you if your trans or not? It's a callback to the '80s and '90s American process within the medical community of determining where to dish out hormones and sex change treatment: if the psychiatrist says 'you are not trans', you don't get to transition. Your born gender will remain on all documents related to you, and all because fuckin Anthony Hopkins over here doesn't think you look lady-like or tough enough. This is some real dumb trans-exclusionary bullshit and given the nature of Buffalo Bill's gender identity, probably exclusionary to all gender non-conforming identities. I guess while I'm lamenting on what makes this film fucking blow, I should talk about the policework. We gotta lot of dim bulbs up there in the FBI, some real 'throwing a bowling ball overhanded' kinda guys. But usually, our cop propaganda films try a little harder to make you think they aren't that dumb, or that there's a few good ones in the bunch. Clarice Starling just keeps pulling these stupid fucking moves, though. I've mentioned how she goes 'shoot to kill' on a suspect, but in that same scene, she refuses to rescue a victim of that suspect in order to go out of her way to kill the guy. After spending the whole film saying ""oh, the guy's out of his mind, he's probably not in control of a lot of his actions"", I'm supposed to think there's any finality, any satisfaction in Clarice loading some lead in their chest? This isn't even a film for ""not all cops"" guys, it's a film for the kind of guy obsessed with punishment, the type who doesn't care for the crime, the context, or anything, but just wants to see 'bad people get what's going to them'. Anyway, fuck this TERF cop movie I'm gonna play some Payday 2.",0,the-silence-of-the-lambs

80878,"A cold film made by a cold, limited artist attempting to be warm. Even though he didn't write this script, Alexander Payne repeats an old trick of starting from a pair of dislikable and unconvincing characters and then figuring out how many decks he can stack and supporting characters he can mechanistically enlist to turn us around on them. He pulled this off once with Sideways, at least for me, but he's never managed it again. So our not-especially-ingratiating adolescent lead will get buddied up for a while with one kid named See, Our Hero Could Be Way Worse!! and another named Yeah, But He Could Also Be Nicer. Once those intricate points have been scored, this pair literally gets airlifted out of the movie, as do two other characters in whom Payne even less successfully feigns temporary interest. Meanwhile, an adult character who has every reason to want to be left alone by everyone else in this movie, and by the movie itself, and who even says as much in one of her big scenes, gets hauled in just often enough to ""humanize"" these characters, I guess, or to let us know that if she can deal with them, maybe we can, too. She also makes clear that she's not interested in being pitied, but tell that to Payne. I don't think he's quite clear what to do with her, so she also goes poof for about 30 climactic minutes of screen time. She gets foisted on a sister invented for this purpose, but comes back later to hold a more important character's hand when it's time for us to pity him, but also to care for him, on which point your own mileage may vary. I personally didn't care, or not care. I just couldn't understand why there was a 133-minute movie about him, or about his dyspeptic chaperone-jailer-teacher-confidant person, in whom I also only fitfully believed. (He's the kind of character who says things like, ""May I purchase you something to imbibe?"" because that's how the screenwriter thinks a Classics professor who only relates to his books probably talks. The people to whom he says this stare back blankly, because they are Cruel, Uncomprehending Rubes, only here to score our protagonist a couple likability points, relatively speaking.)Paul Giamatti plays his character exactly as you know he will, down to almost every line reading and expression. He's not bad, but his familiar and unimaginative performance adds to the impression there's not much to discover about this character, and that Payne's not really here for discovering, anyway. Da'Vine Joy Randolph, in many ways understandably, can't get a fix on who her character is or what exactly the movie wants from her, aside from the most dispiriting options: a black pietà of grief, a shoulder to cry on, a font of side-eye and pithy tough love, etc. She's not bad, either, but not exactly accomplished, and her Boston accent is all over the place, which wouldn't matter if she weren't so emphatic about it when she remembers. I'm not won over by anyone in the cast except the reliably resourceful Carrie Preston. Mostly I'm just wondering how a director makes The Descendants, Nebraska, Downsizing, and this, all in a row, and keeps on trucking as a prestige Hollywood player. I'm sorry to be churlish, but I was so ready to be charmed or at least engaged, and I left once again feeling like I'd spent too long with a self-satisfied and sour artist, palpably impressed with himself and with very, very few other people.(Showplace ICON, Chicago, IL)",2,the-holdovers

Honestly, being a depressed priest is a viable career choice. With everything going on around me resembling the apocalypse, a shred of winter light enlightens my world. Interesting themes and an interesting externalization. Apathetic, but human regardless. The imagery of Bergman's movies are always striking, and his dialogues are infused with so many thoughts; sometimes, it's almost like they were taken from a novel out of context.

The world is vibrant and unique and every other word you might use to say ""it's imaginative."" That said, this is definitely my least favorite Ghibli film thus far. The story ambles along with little-to-no coherency or drive, the characters start with clear motivations but seem to forget them about halfway through and lose most of their personality, and the ""war = bad"" narrative imposed on the film feels a little too inorganic and shoehorned into something that would work without it. As far as social commentary, it's just not nearly as nuanced as something like Princess Mononoke. I'm sure there are plenty of ways people could dissect it to mean something more politically complex, but there's only so many ways you can say ""I just didn't find it compelling.""I dunno. Part of my aversion probably just stems from my low-tolerance for bizarre/gross/just-plain-weird stuff when it doesn't have much of a clear purpose. There's a lot of that here - those moments where you just go ""uh...what the...what?""

74545,"My life is full because I know I am loved.As someone who has admittedly been guilty of it myself from time to time, I get upset when people think of David Lynch as simply the ""weird"" filmmaker who makes things that get little more reaction than confused bewilderment. He's an odd guy, absolutely, and I'm not at all objecting to his art being obtuse, it's by design. However, there is a beating heart underneath and in some cases right in front of your face in regards to Lynch's work. His hiding of his messaging is a thin veil. His films are bittersweet experiences, ones that offer both strong highs and unnerving lows. The Elephant Man showcases the simplest acts of kindness and the most horrendous acts of inhumanity. There is a balance in life, and David understands even in his exaggerated ways that to best tell stories that connect to the human experience, you cannot skimp out on the hard to digest pieces. You need the bad with the good so you can pinpoint how truly wonderful the good is. With emotional performances, gorgeous black and white cinematography, and writing that allows the faces of its actors to often speak at volumes far louder than their words, this is likely Lynch's most ""accessible"" film, and at the same time, it's as blunt yet powerful as it can be in its messaging. You are shown a man who has been ridiculed and abused so much in his life that the simple act of a woman saying she is very pleased to meet him breaks him down to tears. Many scenes in this are depressing as you experience them in the moment, but as is with life, when it all finishes, the light and the dark merges together, and you see the full encapsulation of a life that finally got to find the love it more than deserved. I am so thankful for David.8/10",7,the-elephant-man

11214,"I think in a bit, collectively, we’re going to look back on Villeneuve’s career and be like damn there ain’t much of anything here. Shares all the issues I have with the first and then some. Beige as fuck. Thinly drawn characters. I can see a lot of money has been spent but not well. Big, empty spaces whether outside or in that lack grandeur and detail. Acting that confuses glowering for conveying a prickly emotional reality and complexity. Timothee is very much go girl give us nothing energy. Austin Butler is y’all’s king? The writing undermines what the movie goes for and I have such a poor sense of these worlds/cultures. I was bored as hell, to be sure. But what I keep coming back to is how the film gestures at considering more deeply if not outright critiquing the white savior trope only to commit to it without any complexity. That the Fremen in the background are dark skinned African and Arab men mean mugging poor “sincere” white interloper Paul, while the only Fremen of consequence are the incredibly light skinned Zendaya (who still has yet to prove to me she can do anything really interesting and mature onscreen) and Javier Bardem (Hollywood’s fave white guy they have play brown) says so much about the racial politics infused in Villeneuve’s view on this world. That the Fremen are shown as purely defined by struggle and the oppression they face shows the limits of the white imagination. We need to let go of exalting these white male auteurs who lack panache, depth, and perspective. I read this essay today on The Nation from my good friend, Jorge Cotte, that exemplifies why this movie didn’t work for me:“Villeneuve’s Dune: Part Two is like so much film and television today: It wields its ambivalence like a secret weapon. It offers up set pieces and violent victories for viewers to revel in and draws Paul toward an apocalyptic end that becomes increasingly unavoidable. But the film doesn’t complicate our feelings as much as it performs ambivalence for us. The film warns us against the very thing it gives us. We watch from reclining chairs as Paul starts a holy war—our hands are clean. We get the heroic battles and the guilt on the side. Our hero is tortured so we don’t have to be. All we need to do is just sit back and put up our feet.”",3,dune-part-two
89740,"Add it to the very short list of films that I think transcend the medium. I mean that without any hyperbole. It’s not just an amazing movie that I’ll never forget, because I’ve seen plenty of those, but Abbas Kiarostami has created something so individualistic and special, it completely redefines the possibility of what films can be. It’s reality, it’s fiction, it’s a story of human compassion, it’s a psychology visual essay, it’s terrifying in its truth, it’s beautiful in it’s truth, it’s about dreamers, and of course it’s about movies, but above all, it just is. I dunno, I feel like I want to make people close to me watch this movie, because I don’t know if I’ve seen a better representation of everything I feel all at once all the time.I’ve been Sabzian. So lost in the world, with a deep love for movies, in a way where you can see your own thoughts, feelings, and struggles projected on the screen. They make you feel no longer alone, or afraid; like the comfort blanket you need, but usually can’t get. The dangerous part is when you start to shift all your reality away from your own and into movies. You think, “if only I had the opportunity, I’d make a great movie so others can understand”. But it’s fantasy. I’ve fallen into that fantasy one too many times. I’ve, luckily, always been able to pull myself out of it, but Sabzian has found an opportunity, to try and capitalize on the kindness of strangers and power of celebrity, and maybe for once in his life taste just a drop of the sweet dream he’s been chasing every waking moment of his life. Respect. Admiration. Trust.I’ve been the Ahankah family. Each and every member of them. The mother in her purity of soul (though, my soul is far from pure), wanting to engage with a stranger. Even further when she believes Sabzian is actually Makhmalbaf, she just wants to let this person know she appreciates his work, and sees an opportunity for her son. The son I also have been. Blinded by your own faith and ambitions. Very similar to Sabzian, the son sees an opportunity. “Maybe if I win over this famous director I’ll become a famous actor” is the mentality. That extends to every moment of our lives; how can I get ahead? What opportunities can I seize? When will I get my big break? And I’ve definitely been Mr. Ahankah, weary of strangers entering my home, or the homes of those around me. Knowing in myself, what’s innate in all humans, that need to grow, or, to evolve. So when someone comes a knockin’ they’re thinking the same thing. So never allowing the trust to grow, at least not quickly.I’ve been Abbas Kiarostami, not in the sense of the film world, but in that ability of seeing what’s in front of him for what it is; being able to understand people for what they are, and not what they “should” be. What Kiarostami put into motion is something truly remarkable, that I think should get the film all the credit it deserves. He could read between the lines after reading one article. He felt that connection of Sabzian, he knew the truth in his heart, and he wanted to give him an opportunity to express it, while also selfishly gaining from it as well. He always very backwardly deconstructs everything about society in one fell swoop, and he does it so masterfully. But there’s only one con man here, and it’s Kiarostami himself.The article was written about this very strange story, which honestly should have just been a one-off. This guy impersonated a famous director, tricked the family for just a few days, and got arrested. End of story. Nobody got hurt, only a little money was lent, nothing was stolen, and overall, the worst of it was, a family was duped. The family allowed Sabzian into their home on the pretext of believing a movie would be made in it, and eventually they would have a reward of some sort; who knows if they thought it was money, or if it was fame, or maybe something as simple as gratitude. The lines of everything blurs when Kiarostami steps in. Because he IS a famous director, the rules of the world don’t apply to him. Somehow, he miraculously gets the judge to allow him to film the trial, and for his own convenience, is allowed to move the trial up sooner. Even more baffling is when during the REAL LIFE TRIAL, Kiarostami gets to step in and basically interrogate Sabzian. These are some of the most heart wrenching sequences in all of cinema. Kiarostami doesn’t care about the law, he’s just trying to peel back the layers of this wounded soul, and give him the opportunity and platform to provide the answers Kiarostami knows he wants to give. They even address the fact that Sabzian is essentially still giving a performance in court, but isn’t that what we’re all doing, all day, every day? So he gets to film the court case, and afterwards takes it EVEN FURTHER, by getting all the people involved to reenact everything that just transpired. And I mean, EVERYONE involved, and also adding in a finale, that I’ll touch on in a moment.After the lengthy court scene, when it goes back to being a reenactment, I don’t know how everyone isn’t overwhelmed with emotion when they see Sabzian walk into the Ahankah home. I was overwhelmed, and started to cry. This man who had just duped this family, and got himself arrested, was now back in their home, planned, making the movie he promised. Sabzian’s weird fantasy has somehow come to life, and it’s almost like he was never wrong. But he still was. This movie makes my brain melt, if you try to analyze all the layers working simultaneously, and that’s what I had meant earlier. The movie transcends all rational lines of thinking, and just becomes something that is. It’s real life and a movie.The finale is what cements the idea. Because Kiarostami got involved, he got the real Makhmalbaf to become involved. He creates a scene where Makhmalbaf and Sabzian get to interact, and forgiveness is bestowed, and life will continue on. I don’t know if the scene we see is documentary or reenactment - it looks like reenactment but it plays out like documentary. No matter what, this is something else. Because it takes place after the events of everything, and it becomes a new meta-layered aspect of it all. Kiarostami’s power and influence is able to change the course of all these people’s lives, and create a sense of understanding and love around them. Film has brought them together, more than once. And that final line and shot was also an instant shot to my tear ducts.I can’t wait to watch this again, and again. I feel so overwhelmed, that I may be overreacting, but this is Top 5 material I think. I’ve had a whole week of processing and my feelings haven’t changed. I once had an idea of trying to recreate a very strange night of my life, beat for beat, but then adding in a fictional ending to try and tie it into a greater point. I was told that was basically Close-Up, it was over a year and a half ago I had this idea. Mine was self-serving and indulgent and honestly without purpose. Close-Up is certainly indulgent and self-serving, but it’s so much more, because it peels back the layers of the human psyche, and so many aspects of society and power. At the end of the opening sequence, someone kicks a can that rolls down the hill, representing the story beginning with the article, and then it gets kicked further, because Kiarostami took it to the next step. Now each and every person who watches this only kicks it further.A masterpiece. In every sense of the word.",9,close-up

While I was laughing quite a lot in the beginning, the narrative became sadder and  sadder, as the movie went along. I am 100% convinced, that this was a major influence on the Safdie Brothers and particularly Uncut Gems.  The seamless transitions between the different storylines especially stood out to me. Hectic and anxiety inducing in the beginning and very smooth later down the line, as the separation of the parts begins to blur. The thematic connectivity is what holds the movie together. The search for happiness and forgiveness, not only connects all of the protagonists but the viewer can relate as well. Even though you might reconciliate with the oppressor, the saying ""I will forgive but I won't forget"" holds true because everything that has happened to you in your life, made you the person you are today. I find it incredible, how we can somewhat sympathize with every character. The past affected every one of them differently and pushed some of them over the edge and some of them to seemingly ignore the past. Particularly Tom Cruise's character is interesting in this regard. The whole ""alpha male"" image and self-awareness in his show, is built upon a his past that as he teaches, should be ignored. I don't think it's necessary to dissect every theme of the movie, because it is more of an experience than anything else. If you are interested in an analysis though, I'd highly recommend Noah Biondi's review, obviously far more detailed than anything I could provide on a first viewing.

It's challenging but despite the strange, bizarre & dreamlike imagery, there is an intensity & intimacy to it that's powerful, arresting & strongly captivating.While the subliminal shots, unconventional tricks, precise camerawork, exquisitely lit sets & discordant score add to the oddity, it is the inputs from Bibi Andersson & Liv Ullmann that stand out best. Their performances are vastly different yet exhibit a weird similarity, for one's rendition often feels incomplete without the other's as if they are cut from the same cloth. And the ladies are impressive throughout, both together & in their individual roles.Overall, Persona is one of those films that you watch and then let it simmer for sometime before coming up with a verdict. It is as alluring as it is esoteric and isn't going to please every viewer. Nor is it meant to. The film marks my first stint with Bergman but I'm not sure if starting with this one was the right move.

69220,"Considering Wes Anderson's lofty status among critics — and GRAND BUDAPEST'S even loftier scale — I certainly wasn't shocked when the first rapturous reactions started rolling in from some of my fellow Chicago press screening attendees. But I was a little surprised. Because there was a point about halfway through the movie where, after devouring every bit of delightful whimsy with a smile on my face just like that of Ralph Fiennes' M. Gustave when charming the (literal) pants off a sophisticated septuagenarian, I discovered that my smile had disappeared. Gone too were the laughs and approving nods, never to return. And I wasn't alone. All around me, viewers sat still, silent. Where did the fun go?Perhaps it went exactly where Anderson wanted it to, dissipating along with decorum and taste into the chaos of war, swallowed by the sad incivility of a suddenly post-modern age. Or perhaps it was stifled, and finally suffocated, under the weight of the movie's incessant maneuvering. As Josh Larsen correctly notes, ""no previous Anderson film has had as much story."" Which is to say that no previous Anderson film has had so much plot — a problem when there's seemingly so little at stake, despite the sweep of its backdrop. Watching a man take on a group of prison guards during an escape attempt, killing all of them and himself in the process, prompted me to wonder: Has Anderson ever staged a death that wasn't exploitative or so deadpan comic that the characters' lives were rendered utterly inconsequential? ""The war began at midnight,"" F. Murray Abraham's narrator intones late in the film, a clear homage to Roger Livesey's ""War starts at midnight!"" proclamation in Powell-Pressburger's THE LIFE AND DEATH OF COLONEL BLIMP. Signs of The Archers' influence abound, including the BLACK NARCISSUS-esque showdown at the monastery with its ominous cliffs. But BLIMP'S imprint is most distinct. The friendship between M. Gustave and his lobby boy, Zero, recalls Clive Wynne-Candy (Livesey) and Theo Kretschmar-Schuldorff, played by the brilliant Anton Walbrook. And is it just me, or with his mustache and crisp formality, does Fiennes seem to be channeling Walbrook? But there are thematic and aesthetic connections as well: order vs. anarchy, romanticizing the past, generations colliding, a penchant for farce and rhetorical techniques. Anderson utilizes miniature models; Powell and Pressburger, just as meticulous in their attention to detail, turn actual pages on their protagonist's extraordinary life story.There are significant differences between BUDAPEST and BLIMP, however*. Chiefly for me is the way the latter expertly blends artifice with absurd comedy and drama without ever sacrificing the underlying humanity, while the former only fleetingly pulls off the same trick — its characters too often indistinguishable from the pieces of those miniature models.Addendum: I wrote this before consulting any of the notes I scribbled down at the screening — which sounds ridiculous except that I'm rarely ever able to translate those scribbles into anything useful/meaningful. Whenever I get around to rewatching GBH, I'll see what I can make out of ""Life as sustained illusion,"" ""Pawns in world like pawns in Anderson's world"" and ""Powerless before history.""Listen to Josh and Michael Phillips discuss this movie and almost surely make me look stupid on Filmspotting #482.*Updated/edited to account for more differences, which I took for granted and worded poorly the first go-round.

With  Late Spring  being my first Ozu film, I must admit that it was a bit hard to get into, but once I was able to, I slowly found myself immersed in every word and shot. The relationship between Shukichi and Noriko was deeply relatable and every moment that they shared on screen was so moving and memorable because of their brilliant performances paired with Ozu's beautifully written dialogue and framing. The moment I fell in love with the film was during the last 20 minutes, which were so profound and masterful in the way that it made me reflect on my biggest fears in life. The slow pacing, lingering shots, abrupt cuts, music, themes, simplicity, complexity, and genuineness of the film are all what made this such a deeply moving experience.",9,late-spring
87174,"Bro’s such an edger If there’s anything I can say that I truly do love about Anno as an artist, it’s how playful he is. Whether it’s within the realms of the superficially flat or the solidly shaped he always finds a way to keep the mediums so fabulously fresh by diverging from any avenues that could result in anything resembling that of the corporately contemporary. And within this ever expanding arena of innovative artistry there’s this unshakable and undeniable aura of deep rooted sorrow. To call it simple melancholy would  be to claim a blatant falsehood. For better or worse each and everyone of them has more than just a single part of him sewed into every frame, every drawing, every line, when you watch something made by Anno, your seeing into Anno as a person; Within all the sadness, all the frustration, all the regret, all the flashy fights, all the questionably lustful moments, all the reflective monologues, and all the boundless love for life there’s this man who is as from black & white as one could be. However despite all this multifaceted complexity both with the man and everything he creates, I can’t say I’ve ever found myself ever wholly connecting with but a merger (near bare) handful of things he’s made that have surpassed a level of just passive appreciation. Ritual doesn’t enter this trivial minority by a fair margin but I still find it to be equal parts fascinating and frustrating nonetheless. Hypnotic in its effortless ability to properly speak the language of the visual medium is so commendable, I haven’t seen a live action film by this man that hasn’t made me go “Holy shit” with some jizz-inducing framing or shot composition choices every five minutes. It also has some of his more tranquilly  compelling characters that he’s conjured up and I even found myself actually starting to feel some level of sympathy for them on an almost personal level. However, like a vast majority of his output, there's this unfathomably intangible chasm that continuously keeps me at a seemingly eternal arms length from ever being able to fully connect with him on any truly and deeply intimate level and to this day, I can not for the life of me understand why this is the case. It’s maddening, irritably so but it keeps me coming back again and again again to Anno. He’s got a permanent intellectual and emotional vice grip on my girthy gonads and I can’t tell if I like it or not. Maybe if I come back to this one day, be it next week or next year I’ll finally have a conclusive answer but I will ultimately have to press X to doubt, till then I guess I’ll go ahead and finish His and Her Circumstances, that shit was bussin.",5,ritual-2000

40031,"François Truffaut’s seminal work, The 400 Blows, is one of the most captivating coming of age stories put to film and an extremely influential piece in the development of the French New Wave movement. The film’s protagonist, Antoine Doinel played by Jean-Pierre Léaud, is loosely based on the director’s upbringing as a misunderstood youth traversing life in Paris. The film highlights the hypocrisy and mixed messaging kids are subjected to by authority figures who have no interest in leading by example. Doinel is a genuinely curious boy with terrible luck and without stable role models. His distracted mother who wishes he was never born, step-father with no ambition and a lackluster paternal interest, and a prof obsessed with discipline and no skills to instill discipline routinely misjudge his efforts as excuses and his excuses as personal faults. Throughout the film, Doinel realizes the absurdity of his damned if you do, damned if you don’t position in life and attempts to remove himself from his homelife, forgoing his childhood to make it on his own. Truffaut regularly spotlights Doinel’s desperation to be taken seriously by the adults in his life with scenes of him smoking cigars and rolling cigarettes in a jail cell, connecting deeply with the works of Balzac and plotting crimes at a kids puppet show, then juxtaposing these scenes with ones show Doinel’s boyhood and vulnerability, reminding us of the forced erasure of his childhood. The film is no more romantic or tragic than life is. That it finds beauty in realism is one of its greatest strengths and one of the hallmarks of the film movement it helped develop. The deep richness of the world it depicts, coupled with the momentous freeze-frame ending makes me endlessly curious to find out where Doinel’s story takes him. Brilliant film.

15179,"I enjoyed this slightly more as it went on, but that first hour felt like three hours by itself. There are only a handful of actual events that propel the story forward; the same is true in Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, which I absolutely loved, yet these characters are less compelling. I would say this is much stronger work visually though, and that makes it easier to pay attention to and try and figure out its themes. Bergman seems to be fascinated by the lives of upper-class individuals and the consequences of materialism, particularly in how it relates to religion. I wonder if the pacing of the mini-series is better, and perhaps scenes that were cut out here deepen the characters personalities. In this theatrical cut, the passage of time often felt strange, with very unequal amounts of screen time given to the different years of these children's lives.[Watched the theatrical version]",5,fanny-and-alexander
73288,"So glad to have finally watched this as it’s been my #1 anticipated Scorsese watch. The King of Comedy is a dark comedy that I didn’t find all too funny. It’s more of a sad tale of what a struggling artist goes through when trying to break into the competitive entertainment world. Sometimes talent isn’t enough. Luck seems to be the only constant in life. Don’t get me wrong, De Niro’s character is no saint and there are some definite funny parts, but he is purposefully shown in an exaggerated fashion to highlight what needs to be done to get noticed. It’s honesty not that much different these days when you look at TikTok and all the brainless stuff people do on their to get “famous”. Another theme that is tackled is celebrity worship which is a scary thing for both sides. Even though most of the stuff we see from Rupert’s perspective appears to be fantasy, the media coverage he gets is surprisingly accurate. I really enjoy when films end ambiguously where we don’t know what’s real and what’s fake. Such an eye-opening and disturbing look into the main character. A nice companion ending to Taxi Driver.

74714,"It’s truly a shame that the bane of films accounting tortured real life characters promise to explore their humanity but instead only accentuate their peculiarities. I came into this movie hoping this were not to be the case, but with such a deplorably bland portrayal of the rest of the film’s characters, one can only give thought to the titular character and not so much the world around him. Lynch’s portrayal of Merrick’s life is almost voyeuristic in that sympathy is the only emotion you’re allowed you to feel. His every action and unfulfilled dream is carried out to invoke pity while the extent of his emotional complexity only juxtaposes his appearance with his kind demeanor. I just wish this film was far less dramatized and instead had a greater focus behind his early life before he was put on a pedestal for freakshow audiences, the scientific community and you, the viewer. And yet, this self-aware film tells you many, many times that people are afraid and intrigued by what they don’t understand... but don’t you know that already?",1,the-elephant-man
76593,"Yes, it's altogether true. You may not believe it, much like certain stories or lone witness accounts may be difficult to swallow, but I do, on occasion, commit attention to ""real cinema"". It's not all superhero flicks and rockstar biopics in which Ozzy Osbourne snorts ants. There are facets to my motion picture appetite. Especially when I'm able to stream a film like this at home completely legally and free of charge. Well, free-ish, there is a public service tax, but it's all handled in some government computer now, so it's no fee that I ever notice. What I do notice, however, is film-making that stands out in some way. Like a piece of classic celluloid which, only five years after the end of the second world war, gives us a narrative told from four different perspectives. I can't imagine this was common practice at the time, when the world was more black and white (no pun intended). My own point of view is therefore (among other reasons that laziness prevents me from penning) that Rashomon is a pioneer of note. Enhance the experience with some superlative cinematography (or eye porn if you want to be crude about it) that makes sweet love to my OCD, and I'm rendered enthusiastic, if not eager, to explore the rest of Kurosawa's works.

43555,"Far too long for general audiences but also far too short to do justice to Tolstoy's novel, King Vidor's War and Peace is a deeply flawed yet still admirable attempt at adapting one of the most revered and notoriously difficult literary works to translate to the screen. There's a reason why Sergei Bondarchuk's version clocks in at over seven hours and why the BBC opted for the miniseries format both times when adapting it—you just can't cut corners with this epic, intimately detailed story. Having not read the novel I'm probably in a better position to appreciate the film as a piece of standalone cinema rather than being predisposed to critique its every misstep and to overlook the injustice it does to the source material. Even still, it comes across as rushed, uneven and oversimplified—the deep and satisfying sense of humanity weaved sumptuously through history that I'd experienced from the recent BBC version was missing, only a few moments standing out as remarkable.The casting isn't as terrible as some might make you believe— the dainty and always lovable Audrey Hepburn makes for a superb Natasha, whilst Mel Ferrer is a serviceable Prince Andrei. More problematic is Henry Fonda as Pierre, he's too old for the part and not particularly believable as a socially awkward academic, Paul Dano giving the definitive performance I've seen thus far. Vittorio Gassman is very charismatic in the brief screen time he gets and John Mills, who gets even less, feels like a waste of talent.Vidor's direction is disappointingly flat for a man who'd made some incredibly innovative silent films, although Jack Cardiff's magnificent colour photography and the impressive set design makes up for its sluggishness. If anything it's a watchable, perfunctory introduction to the source material and characters, but akin to flicking through pages rather than actually reading it and totally undermining its grand ambitions.Streamed on The Criterion Channel.",5,war-and-peace
55173,"Turn the lights low. Grab the vape pen. As the credits begin to roll we can finally feel like Don Draper escaping his personal life for the onscreen drama. La Dolce Vita is the movie that mocked me for years — posters haunting me as a reminder that I’ve never seen the highly regarded Fellini and let me tell you, as much as I love his affinity for dreamy sequences and troubled characters there was something lacking here. Was the vapid nature of all these characters seeping into the overall plot? Was my disdain for Marcello justified? Sometimes it felt like Fellini was protesting this fleeting, empty lifestyle and yet a reverence that makes it hard to truly feel invested in anyone. No one is redeeming or complex — Marcello is a one-note cheater obsessed with celebrity and looking for “love” in all the wrong places. Great. Western culture takeover, celebrity gossip, artistic meanderings, and cocktail parties — these are things in Italian post-war culture that would eventually evolve into a possible correlation with the social-media political circus we have today... possibly? It never quite explored these themes for us to be able to reflect on them. If all else, this serves an excellent time capsule into an era of Fifties Italian-machismo-fashion culture (most of this movie I spent gawking at the outfits), but never quite makes a definite point on how we want to feel about celebrity culture other than the fact it is the “new religion”.",3,la-dolce-vita

At one point in the film, the little boy is trying to ask an older man a question but the man doesn’t here him. The boy chases the man all the way to the next town over and still never gets a chance to speak. I think everyone can relate to this. Not necessarily this exact experience, but everyone knows what it’s like to go unheard when you are the smallest and quietest one in the room. It’s little things like that that make this film more relatable than almost any other film about childhood that I’ve seen. Not only that, it’s a film about empathy. I think as we get older, we start to feel a little less empathy and more about ourselves. Even though the boy didn’t necessarily want to go on a long journey throughout his village just to return a notebook to his friend, he did it anyway because he wanted to be kind. I think a story like this could only be told through the eyes of an eight-year-old. Even though most people feel empathy all throughout their lives, when you’re a child, we feel it more so. The adults in the story wanted to discipline the boy because they thought he should learn a lesson. Yet somehow, the boy is on the other side of the spectrum.

83961,"I thought about it and I’ve come to the conclusion that I hate this movie. I won’t deny that it’s visually stunning and there are some great performances, but the way Nolan is literally incapable of viewing the bombing of Japan as a tragedy outside the lens of how it will affect either America or global politics is just sickening. It’s like he doesn’t grasp that it was a real event and real people died. He can only perceive it as “what if this happened to us? The real horror is that we could be bombed.” There’s an absolutely egregious scene where Oppenheimer is giving a speech to people celebrating after the bombs are dropped, and he begins to hallucinate because of his guilt. But he doesn’t see the real victims. He sees these people in the audience, still celebrating the deaths of the real victims of the real bombings, as if they are the ones with their faces melting off and their bodies charred. It feels like this twisted sort of whitewashing, a result of Nolan being unable to care about the already very real consequences of what Oppenheimer created. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are examined through three lenses. 1) How it makes Oppenheimer feel guilty. 2) How it exposes hypocrisy and indifference in the American government. 3) What the existence of these bombs means for either America, or global politics (and by global he means America and Europe.) When it comes down to it, Nolan doesn’t give a shit that bombs were already dropped. He only gives a shit about how it could affect him and his.Two side notes: the editing was unbelievably bad for a significant portion of the movie, and Nolan does not know how to write women.

Letterboxd mods: Please implement this feature of marking certain sections as spoilers instead of the entire review. Even Delicious Fruit does it.The intangibility of human bonds is the topic at hand now, how one can transcend time with a significant other. To be in the perspective of another, embrace another life and live it, literally, in the flesh, and challenge the laws of causality and space without the need of resorting to the overused topic of time-travelling. To pursue one dream and one's own identity. That's what the film is.Except, it turns out it isn't. A commercial product is not necessarily the enemy of quality filmmaking, quality necessarily being a subjective term; however, this is Shinkai's most commercial product, his most popular and renowned one, and sadly his most superficial and, at times, idiotic. The film opened the possibility for exploring the idea of becoming another person in another body, to experience a life and feel emotions you will never ble able to live for your own. We are unique individuals with a well-defined individuality, and it is this uniqueness that makes that precious, insurmountably valuable. Shinkai opens this concept with a man in a woman's body touching his boobs for comedic effect. Not once. Not twice. Not even thrice. He even plays this dirty card during a dramatic moment for... comedic relief? The girl is not absent from sin as she is seen doing this with male genitalia, again, for comedic effect. If I want Rob Schneider comedy, I'll look for it (I freaking don't).Your Name represents a thematic remake of the director's astonishing masterpiece, The Place Promised in Our Early Days (2004) (up to the point of visually replicating the iconic crater scene in this film), but with a notorious decrease in emotional maturity and psychological exploration. It becomes more an adventure against time where a romance is born, against Shinkai's previously established ideology, very coincidentally. The resolution it gives during the final minutes is also a betrayal against how life goes on (and must go on) in spite of our hopeless insistence of trying to retain improbable relationships. He's a realist, an honest one. Not here. Here, he sells the Disney World fantasy of ""happily ever after"". This radical change is clearly appealing the sensibilities of a Western audience who receives exactly that fantasy as a satisfactory resolution. It is no surprise that his most mature works receive the least praise and are even cataloged as ""boring, self-indulgent and empty narrated monologues"". If only directors could achieve that depth of vocabulary and stream of consciousness when it comes to treating their characters...Not here. This film is a product of popular demand and it paid pretty well in cash but against Shinkai's philosophy of life's unpredictability and the multi-generational complexity of human relationships.The key scene is the kuchikamizake drinking, were we are taken into a segment that basically represents experimentation in the animation department. It works because it is so radically different. With an unintended nod to Noé's Enter the Void (2009), we become a cell again, forming life, witnessing birth and exploring an entire life and its challenges with a different visual style. It's stunning. It's one of the relevant revelatory moments in cinema, like the imagined, hypothetical flashback Aron Ralston has in Boyle's 127 Hours (2010). It almost convinces you that the film has a deeper agenda than a rom-com with sexual humor and dramatic moments. It's indescribably gorgeous.Credit where it is due, the second act picks up quite nicely the superficiality of the first act, describing the act of tragedy just as it is, utilizing exceptional animation and editing, and a beautiful score (with a cringe soundtrack I must add), but then stupid script decisions are made, such as:SPOILERS-Both not being able to remember their respective names even if they lived within each others' bodies and had an astral encounter!-Both recognizing each other even if they, supposedly, had forgotten about each other, which was also inexplicable-Him writing ""I LOVE YOU"" in her hand instead of her name, which is just a cheap and cliched stunt to extract emotions freely from the audience while not helping the plot at all (something that, hilariously, she agrees with when she reads the palm of her hand)-Related to the previous point, not enough dramatic background is offered to justify that he LOVES her. What are his motivations for such a strong decision? Just a coincidental, sexually-related fantasy perspective?END OF SPOILERSIt comes as clear what Shinkai used for replacing epistemological discussion: body-swapping and alternate timelines. These topics are immediate attention-grabbers for audiences. Ask Nolan. He loves playing with theories on time and space, even dreams and memory. Those elements make his films almost automatically attractive to try out. That's not bad per se, sure, until you throw out all valuable possibilities out of the window and push the plot forward with Deus-Ex-Machina decisions in the name of romance and suspense.Characters, on the other hand, are very human. I tremendously loved the story of the grandmother and their journey to the mountain to ""cross the underworld"" and offer the kuchikamizake as a tribute. The whole journey with Mitsuha carrying her grandmother and speaking about past lives couldn't stop me from thinking of Ballad of Narayama (any version you wish). Subplots like that add a lot of value to character backstories. The film is full of little moments like this, mostly in the second act, which add the depth Shinkai is known for (and unjustifiably maligned).The greatest deceit this film does is that it tries to convince you that the two characters have a significant and even transcendent connection, when they actually don't. And people believe they do, because of the visuals. What is the correlation there? Zero. However, it seems people are, indeed, falling for what it is supposed to represent, for what it was meant to be, and never achieved to be.So, this is Makoto's Shinkai worst, even below Children Who Chase Lost Voices (2011), so I'll have to favor the ""he gave me a kiss out of nowhere and therefore I am willing to risk my life and follow him to the underworld forever amidst a milkshake of random international culture references"" flick over the ""he probably touched my boobies and I touched his wee wee because we swapped bodies randomly, but we are meant to be together forever even if we inexplicably forget about each other, not necessarily meaning that we will be able to illogically recognize ourselves if we make eye contact ever again"" flick.At least, we have tons and tons of trains again.55/100",4,your-name

You know that feeling when you’re sitting there watching a film — you could be at the movie theater, at your house — and you realize, “I think I’m watching one of my all-time favorite movies right now?” I had that thought a few times while watching Bergman’s masterpiece Persona and I’ll always remember today’s viewing specifically, because I was continually wowed and awed at the elegance and magic that kept popping up on my screen. The Criterion Blu-ray that I bought also comes with a wonderful booklet that has an essay “The Persistence of Persona” by Thomas Elsaesser, as well as interviews with Bergman himself, and star Bibi Andersson.Elsaesser says,“Persona has an almost hypnotic pull; it draws the spectator in and never lets go…”Elsaesser also cites Susan Sontag, who said quite eloquently,“It’s correct to speak of Persona in terms of the fortunes of two characters named Elizabeth and Alma who are engaged in a desperate duel of identities. But it is equally pertinent to treat Persona as relating the duel between two mythical parts of a single self: the corrupted person who acts and the ingenuous soul who founders in contact with corruption.”From the introductory schizophrenic dream that Bergman tackles us with — it even features the signature eye-slicing scene from the surreal French classic Un Chien Andalou — to the claustrophobic hospital rooms, to the beautiful beaches and shores of Fårö (Bergman’s favorite place to film), we as an audience are invited to witness the tango between Elisabet Vogler, an actress who’s gone mute, and Sister Alma, the young nurse assigned to take care of the actress.Bibi Andersson & Liv Ullmann as Alma & Elisabet respectively were both spectacular — in crazily complex and different roles. Credit to Andersson for leaving me engrossed since she has nearly all of the movie’s dialogue. Ullmann, like a veteran silent film actress, was able to convey nearly every emotion in the book through just her face and her actions.Sven Nykvist, I salute you. The camerawork, as totally expected, was immaculate for this movie. He later wins two Oscars for his cinematography for two more Bergman movies (Cries & Whispers, Fanny and Alexander), but he deserves some massive kudos for the innovations in this movie that no metal hardware could really represent. Most people know that, but I just want to give him the EJ-salute.The score also deserves a call-out. This score felt so alive. The opening credits shocked me at first when it happened, and the thunderous, percussive-heavy score that accompanied the opening credits with the extremely fast jump-cuts was such an awesome way to open this movie. Sets the tone right away.By the film’s final ten or so minutes, I was audibly saying, “what the fuck” to myself. I thought that the movie kept finishing, but it kept peeling back one more layer on top of the mind-fuckery that happens throughout this film. It felt like when I watched Mulholland Drive for the first time. And with the name of the nurse/caretaker being Sister Alma, I thought of Phantom Thread (where I’m like 99% sure PTA got the name for the caretaker in that movie from this film). Calling this movie a bridge between Mulholland Drive and Phantom Thread, with the artistic madness of Un Chien Andalou, with of course the signature added garnish of Bergman’s thoughts on “being,” “life,” and “death”…… *chef’s kiss* You get Persona. And you totally see the influence this movie had on many, many future movies that came after. I feel enlightened. Imagine believing so strongly in something that you devote your entire life to it.

And while ""Life In A Glasshouse"" will always be Amnesiac's crown jewel, I think ""Like Spinning Plates"" is the track I least expected to ever show up in a feature film, lathering its appearance with a strange satisfaction on my part. And the reason I've done nothing but talk about Radiohead thus far is because, surprisingly enough, I don't have much to say about INCENDIES. The shocking twist -- despite how impossibly unlikely it would actually be -- is indeed a thrilling one, and one that you'd never expect (maybe due to the aforementioned reasons). But I think it's giving the film an inflated sense of worthiness (or least tricking people into seeing it that way), somehow providing an excuse for the preceding two hours of overtly intense melodrama containing no authentic reactions with which it can tangibly resonate. The heroes in either timeline are nothing more than instruments made to endure suffering for entertainment's sake, and it seems like the only reasonable explanation for most of the mechanics are: ""so Villeneuve can set up his monster revelation."" It really is intriguing to some degree, but that intrigue is curtailed by a formalism I find to be frankly quite drab and dull, only abetted by the overbearingly austere and in-your-face-somberness of everything therein. In short: it's crafted well, but not in a manner I find personally rousing. (Except for maybe the interstitial flashback structure, which I would argue is ghastly inefficient.) It's severely detached when it really shouldn't be; as a moderately entertaining mystery/whatsit, it's average. As the intense emotional blackhole it's ostensibly supposed to be, it misses the mark by a decent-sized margin.",4,incendies

They are on their way for a family reunion, as they are mourning the death of the eldest son of the family. We see the father, who is not really happy with the way his son turned out walking past the town. The family is not as broken as the pieces of tiles in the bathroom but still they don't walk together. Their steps don't match, but they still walk. Maybe, one after the other or vice-versa. The father wants to put off his profession onto the next clan, but the way the son snatches his writings from being embarrassed tell us otherwise. There is an acceptance of the new wife but there are still back-lashes. The mother finds solace in inviting the wrestler-like kid who was responsible for her son's death not because she is cruel but because that's the only time she feels satisfied. They walk again; two sets of mother and son this time, but now they witness the yellow butterfly that follows them home. The grief is present, the mother cooks to let her guard down, the son smokes, the father doesn't talk or just wants to walk it off and the sister doesn't shut up. The uptight main member of the family loosens up as they talk about music, or as he sees his neighbor taking her last breathes. Every single person in the family is different from each other, but every single one of them can be the same too.The kids put on the shoes of the adults to bring in the beauty to the center table but Hirokazu Koreeda's investigation of the family doesn't end there.

83950,"I made an account just to rant about how much I hated this film. I understand Nolan has tons of fans online and the reviews are positive but I found this movie so laughably bad that I couldn’t stop laughing in the cinema. Had to move from the middle to the back row in hopes I wasn’t disturbing others. This movie makes the last act of Dark Knight returns or Tenet look like masterpieces. This film is the Lex Fridman podcast of films. A product meant to look and sound smart, but empty and ultimately dumb. I cannot properly convey into words how almost every decision Nolan made felt wrong to me. I’ll give it a try:About twenty minutes in, I realized that the “opening montage” would actually be the entire movie. No scene is allowed to breathe, to sink in. There’s zero depth. The soundtrack and speed through of scenes creates an aesthetic distance - but one unlike Kubrick’s. The material, especially the third act, is asking you to care about the interpersonal dynamics at play, but this method of scanning through scenes is as if one is skipping through a netflix preview menu. Like with previous films, the soundtrack was doing so much emotional lifting that I found it distracting from what was happening in this speed run of scenes.I couldn’t care about of these characters because what I’ve learned about them comes from on the nose dialogue descriptions made by other characters. How many times can Oppenheimer be told what he’s like? Can we see that through narrative character choices? I laughed out loud each time he was described by someone to his face.Nolan has been accused of misogyny in his films, and while I thought he was awkward presenting female characters I never agreed with that criticism until now. His portrayal of these depressed, alcoholic volatile, and emotionally rash women was embarrassing. Felt like I was watching incel the movie. Emily Blunt who I’ve always considered to be a great actress, turns in a performance so laughably exaggerated that it felt like a Mad tv sketch. I couldn’t stop laughing every time she’s shown holding a drink. Almost every single scene she’s in she’s pouring a drink, or red faced drunk. Florence Pugh’s character is a volatile mess, an emotionally distressed woman who can’t take care of herself. The sex scene with the book was ridiculous and the second sex scene where blunt was watching made me laugh so damn hard. The Einstein character is another example of how bad this screenplay was. The guy is a total one dimensional magical cartoon man who shows up to impart kind wisdom, I felt like I was watching a Disney+ star wars series. The narrative structure of the film was a total mess. Nolan likes to play with time but in this case it felt totally unnecessary and I think actually harmed the impact of the narrative. Due to the messy structure, it was hard to understand what the hell RDJ’s character was even doing in the film, by the time his character took on a prominent role in the film, I had long stopped caring. The film’s first quarter had zero stakes or narrative drive. Once the race against the nazi’s is kicked off the film has some momentum, which is why this is the sequence used in the trailers. The third act is supposed to be a sober character drama but Nolan’s utter lack of depth made the dialogue and performances from A-list actors feel rubbery and cartoonish. This last issue leads into my final point. The film is a clear act of bait and switch. The film as it stands does not need the 70mm or IMAX viewing. It’s a badly paced, cartoonish character drama. Should have been on Netflix. There are some visual effects randomly used in the beginning of the film and the only nuclear explosion shown is a very tiny quick scene. In my city, IMAX most showings are sold out for several days. I cannot imagine that those paying for an IMAX experience will feel it was worth the ticket price to mostly see giant close ups of Cillian Murphy looking ghostly or Blunt’s ridiculous MadTV drunken red face.",1,oppenheimer-2023

It's not just about loyalty, it's about self-reflection. How are you going to go on with your life? Even after death. The stream of the mind in the midst of war, the coldness freezing the soul, survival becomes the most deeply inflicted factor. The Ascent follows the path of two Soviet peasant soldiers sent in search for food, what they find after reaching the village is nothing but dust covered in snow. It is a journey that not only brings in what is to be a partisan and the survivalist instinct that goes with it, it also brings in the morality of all of it.The final shot is so harrowing that you'e clinged to your bed on a winter evening, screaming into the void. Last time I was like THIS when I finished up watching No Man's Land (2001 - Danis Tanovic - Bosnia and Herzegovina) or Paths of Glory (1957 - Stanley Kubrick), that final scene of both still haunt me and now The Ascent is added to that. Larisa Shepitko (spouse of Elem Germanovich Klimov)'s last film before her death in a car accident is gorgeously shot in the snow, the closeups are so revealing that you feel the presence of that character with you.The final 17 minutes of this movie are one of the most immersive things I've ever seen. It really pierces our soul. The cries, the pleading and asking for forgiveness. Religious allegory is the main theme in this 1977 Golden Bear-winner, the allegorical images and symbolism especially in the end are extremely heavy and evident.

Numerous scenes just kinda happen arbitrarily, without clear connection to overarching story, arcs, or themes.

82929,"The central theme of this Yasujirō Ozu film (my second) is largely similar to that of his most famous work, Tokyo Story, but it examines it in a softer and less pointed way. Ozu's focus here is on ageing and loneliness, examined through the story of a middle-aged widower looked after by his 24-year-old daughter, who he thinks ought to be getting married. It's a story that would stand the test of dozens of tellings and never be worn out thanks to its sheer universality, but Ozu's approach is unique in that he intermingles it with questions of the place of the elderly in modern Japanese society, as well as a smattering of rumination regarding the Second World War's legacy among those who experienced it first-hand.Ozu being Ozu, nothing is rammed down our throats - this is not a politically motivated film in any observable way, and the strict focus on human themes ties in well with the writer-director's typically gentle style. Speaking of which, Ozu, like Jean-Luc Godard, is one of those directors whose work can be identified within ten seconds of watching it, and yet unlike Godard's, it's entirely accessible. There's something in his rhythmic editing, emotive ""pillow shots"", refusal to move the camera, and spatial distortion that is authentically engrossing. He's been compared to Mike Leigh, and there are similarities between the two directors' ways of working (their concern for day-to-day life, the often apparent lack of plot in their films), but Ozu's style isn't improvisation-friendly - notice the lack of long takes, and the way he always cuts between - never during -  lines of dialogue. Such is his meticulous attention to style.However, this style does not come at the expense of substance, and Ozu definitely shares Leigh's striking perceptiveness regarding human emotions. Everything is communicated beautifully, and despite Chishū Ryū's understated work in the central role, Ozu isn't really a performance director in the way Leigh or John Cassavetes is. He reveals the emotion through his placid style and predilection for tranquility. If all of his films are as staunchly unmanipulative and unpretentiously beautiful as this, I can't wait to dive further in.Added to My top 250+",8,an-autumn-afternoon

60165,"Could content made by the original creator still be classified as fan fiction? Well, technically no, but leave it to Hideaki Anno to make the impossible, possible.The Evangelion Rebuild films aren't so much about telling their own story or introducing new audiences to the world of Anno's Evangelion as it is about Evangelion itself. Not Evangelion the original series and film mind you, but what it's come to represent in the collective minds of all those who've ran away with romantic notions of its placement as a bedrock of their youth. If there's anything ""existential"" here it's in a generation's obsession with iconography, the hive-minded fan-culture that surrounds it, and ultimately, the commodification of these attributes by celebrating the steadfast loyalty of continuous consumer support, well into adulthood, because after all, Evangelion helped you cope as a teen, right? Well, at the very least, that's how I choose to view these gussied-up Rebuild celebrations because if viewed as actual films, they're a mess.Gobbledygook that borders on self-parody—congratulatory about using metacontextual frameworks to aid in its commentary as if the Japanese New Wave of the 60s didn't already came and went. The Evangelion rebuild films are at best, well-intentioned nonsense, and at worst, try-hard nonsense. The kind of neurotic patch-job of ""this would look cool"" storyboarding decision-making blended with a cocktail of Terrence Malick-isms via insular logic. It's its own religious institution, built inside the pop culture echo chamber that houses it—don't expect common sense to make any appearances here.Philosophical word vomit, fashion accessory human trauma, comically nebulous dialogue, and superfluous worldbuilding are all the name of the game when discussing these films. What's important is that you ""feel"" it or whatever that means. But honestly, it's about audience participation, your willingness to ignore all prior convictions for perceived issues you've lobbied at other creator's art before, and instead, choose to see the sincerity in what's essentially ""Gurren Lagann but pretend it actually makes sense logistically"" all without a hint of self-awareness, irony, or acceptance of the fact that this works because it's inherently childish. Kids playing with their toys: Smash! Grrrr! Pow!, robot go BOOM! PEW PEW!These installments, and Thrice Upon a Time especially, are about these dreamt-up escapist scenarios. Expanding the lore of Angels, Seele, vague prophecies, Eva units, and other tidbits that at one point were just tertiary mechanics in exploring the characters themselves. For as high as the stakes and situation were for the original Evangelion tv-series and subsequent film, it was never actually about those things. The spectacle was grand, but ultimately, the intent was intimate. It was about dealing with depression, imposter syndrome, parental (ir)responsibility, the inherent ugliness, and beauty that came hand-in-hand with growing up. Navigating the uncertainty of adulthood. It's about everything else that the cool-looking mecha series came to inhabit. Evangelion was the title, but ultimately, not the point.The same can't be said about these rebuild films. Exploitatively mining these aspects, yes, but now it's about pre-established value, no different than what the Star Wars property has become over time. In a way, that's commendable, that an anime property outside the behemoths of Gundam or whatever long-running shounen is airing at any given time, that what was at once a cult-classic, has now grown to a size capable of supporting such an excursion by its head architect. An adoration not even George Lucas was able to maintain.But if you're not a subscriber that deifies this creative and everything they attach their name to, it becomes harder to justify any of it. This is a film that makes broad emotional story beats, patting itself on the back for taking what iota of characterization exists in its current state and proceeding to overanalyze it, making supposedly ""profound"" discoveries, despite having to rely entirely on the audience to at least have a cursory knowledge of the original material to make any of these epiphanies stick because otherwise, they don't. If viewed independently, they're all facsimiles of the content they came from. Personalities robbed of nuance, where it expects the audience to fill in the gaps with what they've gathered prior to viewing it, as well as whatever projection already grafted onto the material from years of germinated love for their status symbols. Whatever brief moments of cleverness or insight that these Rebuild films end up landing on are continuously thwarted by excessive, unchecked indulgence.In a way, this film is reflective of that infamous scene in The End of Evangelion, where we, the audience, get the ""privilege"" of being the bedridden Asuka, while the film itself is Shinji, hovering over us with its seed in its palm. You'll either relish the opportunity to be the object of your cult leader's affection or just find the whole thing incredibly awkward.These films aren't necessarily for fans but more so for diehard fanatics. And you know what? That's fine.What a colorful, sincere shit show.",2,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time
30558,"I wanted to be nice and give this a 2.5 and just acknowledge that this movie is not for me, but such a kind score just wouldn’t convey how bored I was by this film.On a technical level, it’s fine. Kurosawa is a master of blocking and made the somewhat repetitive locations visually interesting through his orchestration of crowds, body movement and genius use of long takes. The cast give generally good performances, though I wasn’t particularly blown away by anybody. The music was somewhat grating and sounded almost Disneylike.The concept I like, but in practice it was incredibly meandering and inconsistent. ‘Red Beard’ is about a doctor who dreams of serving wealthy clients but instead finds himself stationed in a clinic which serves the poor. Each case/patient is treated in a somewhat episodic manner in which we learn about the patients and Japanese society by extension. The film is bullish in its messaging. The poor suffer from medical problems caused by their destitution while the elite horde public funds and suffer from medical problems caused by their greed, laziness and gluttony. In a better film I might find myself caring about this story, but just because there’s truth in a film’s themes doesn’t make for an interesting film, especially when it feels like it essentially only exists to beat the audience over their heads with its themes.Overall, this just isn’t very interesting. It lethargically drags out it’s 3 hour run time making it something of an excruciating viewing experience. This is one of the few movies I’ve seen recently where I really felt the urge to stop watching around the hour mark.",2,red-beard
83183,"While I do think there is a lot to love about this movie, unfortunately it just didn’t work for me overall. I think where it exceeds is obviously the insanely gorgeous visuals, the fun music, and just the overall cute romantic vibe. But it wasn’t really much to me beyond a cute story. I’ve seen plenty of romances and in comparison I just didn’t see anything that made this stand out or made me care about their particular relationship. The science fiction aspect is cool but also leads to my biggest issue with the film.I take issues with consent very seriously and it really impacts how I will personally feel about a film. And this film is VERY flippant with it’s approach to it. The way Taki non-consensually explores Mitsuha’s body is gross and it’s gross that this film 1. acknowledges that he shouldn’t be doing that and then 2. has him do it anyway while playing it for jokes.

26460,"Oh dear. Oh dearie me. This review's divided into two (I'm not an animal, I'm not going to divide this into six parts times two) - the complaining about the film (incoming, book snob alert) and the more serious analysis. Choose your poison. Spoilers abound. Shield your eyes. I. The ComplainingSo I spoiled the film Satantango for myself by reading Laszlo Krasznahorkai's novel. The film's a pretty faithful adaptation of the novel, what with Laszlo Krasznahorkai serving as a writer, and despite the misgivings I had with Werckmeister Harmonies understating the main characters' relationships and personalities from Krasznahorkai's novel, The Melancholy of Resistance, Werckmeister Harmonies felt like a stand-alone film with an ending which far surpassed the novel's in gravitas. In short, it worked. Satantango didn't work for me. The characters are paultry summations of their novel counterparts, their reactions (for the most part, shout-out to the bar owner who acted like he was in a different movie altogether) as if they were directed by Yorgos Lanthimos's contribution to the Greek Weird Wave -- muted and hollow. I get that the film wanted to convey apathy, the stifling effect of surroundings on a person's psyche, but I couldn't figure out why Mihaly Vig's Irimias was so blasé, why Mrs Halics's religious scowling was so tamed, or why Sanyi Horgos's bedeviled teenage persona was so safe. Estike's cat torture scene wasn't as sadistic as the novel's (how could she prove she was capable of winning?), but at least it made sense, because torturing a theoretical cat on paper is far easier than torturing a cat on film, okay. But why spend 7+ hours with these villagers when you don't even let the audience in on Mrs Schmidt's pining for and waiting for Irimias, Irimias's/Petrina's/Sanyi's confrontation with a levitating body in the fog (and their subsequent discussion on religion and God), or (and worst of all) the doctor's delusional belief that he could control events by putting his observations of the villagers to paper in the very end (which served to further the theme of censure)? I mean, if you're going to spend 7 hours on Satantango, make it the novel, because the film is this bare-bonesed art-house-ification of a novel with actual feelings, mystical events, and ringing pathos. Much to my surprise and chagrin, I got little of pathos from watching the film. In no way does it justify its 7+ hour runtime. Lastly, if you're going to stick to the novel chapter titles, at least number them forwards and then backwards as in a tango, what the hell do you have to lose with incorporating the numbers? - - - - - - - - - - - - IntermissionIn that case, I'll miss the thing by waiting for it. - FK [Franz Kafka]- - - - - - - - - - - - II. The AnalysisThe ending of Satantango doesn't just feel horrible because it also happens to be the beginning of Satantango, a seeming lack of progress owing to the cyclical nature of the prose, but because of what precedes the ending (in the novel). The doctor writes down his observations of his neighbours, what initially appears objectively, based on his own vantage point at his home, but then he wings it and writes what we know couldn't have transpired, because his neighbours have gone in search of theoretically better pastures as promised by Irimias. The doctor, however, is so convinced he's able to see a pattern, furthermore believes he can MAKE things happen. And we think, HA HA STUPID, you don't know anything, because we KNOW you're wrong. Your neighbours are GONE, G-O-N-E, GONE. So, what happens next is stupefying, because he then writes down, word for word, the opening of the book, Satantango, with Futaki awaking to hear the sound of the bells. How does the doctor go from being utterly wrong to utterly right? How can he be both wrong and right about his neighbours? The paradox is lessened a little by introducing time -- he was wrong then he was right -- just like the sky being daytime blue then being sunset red -- but then how did he progress from wrong to right? How did a wrong create a right? It's not as banally obvious as a sky changing color. Suddenly, the introducing of time and causality makes things worse, because it just doesn't make any sense. And so, there's some really effective dread from reading those last pages of Satantango, because it seems unimaginable that the doctor could be so right when he was oh so wrong. And to explain the dread away is to make all the events which happened the doctor's narrative, but it also erases the existence of the other villagers by making them mere interpretations of the doctor's imagination. It doesn't feel right. And yet, this is exactly what Irimias's reporting to his government does in the chapter immediately preceding the end -- it's a lens to see people through without ever seeing them first-hand. And by the time anyone of supposed importance reads Irimias's reports, it's been again censured by government workers into a more sanitised version. A version of a version. What Irimias does, the doctor does, and if we choose to believe the entire book/film through the doctor's narrative, the book/film censures as well. We've been duped into knowing, but not really knowing. Seeing, but not really seeing. As if through a fog. And maybe the film shows this all along -- this seeing but not really knowing. We don't get to know anyone, because what we see has been censured through someone else. They seem like ghosts, not people. Funnily enough, when I read the book without knowing the ending, the two passages which jumped out at me the most in the first part were Futaki's musing on the passage of time and the doctor's comment on the infernal cycle of existence. They had much in common. For obvious reasons. Futaki:He gazed sadly at the threatening sky, at the burned-out remnants of a locust-plagued summer, and suddenly saw on the twig of an acacia, as in a vision, the progress of spring, summer, fall and winter, as if the whole of time were a frivolous interlude in the much greater spaces of eternity; a brilliant conjuring trick to product something apparently orderly out of chaos, to establish a vantage point from which chance might begin to look like necessity...The doctor:..and must note it all down, since only by doing so could he hope not to vanish one day and fall a silent captive to the infernal arrangement whereby the world decomposes but is at the same time constantly in the process of self-construction.Change, but not really change, a cycle. Infernal. Relentless. Merciless. Seemingly pointless. The old man ringing the bell was a test of humanity for the doctor and he completely failed to be reminded of not only his calling or his profession, but his humanity as a person. He receded back into his house to do exactly what Irimias did. He is no better. Lastly, what I loved about the novel/movie was the inclusion of nature, its embrace of people (spiderwebs created over them as they slept), people becoming intertwined with nature. Nature as cyclical. Human beings as cyclical. The villagers were waiting for a different utopian land. If the land changed, if nature changed, if their four walls changed, if it stopped raining, maybe, they, too, could change, and yet, they were willing to change because of the oratory skills of a human being, Irimias. They failed to see that they could change within their own surroundings, and they allowed their surroundings to define them completely when the sounds around them served less as a reminder of the trap they were in, but a call to arms, a call to action. That these people thought that they could be any less uglier to one another if they were in a different setting is absolutely riotously funny, and unfortunately, a timeless cautionary tale. Satantango begs us not to be afraid of change, to do something within our current set of circumstances no matter how difficult in its uncertainty that change may seem, or worse, how utterly pointless change may seem if put in the context of it being a point in an endless cycle of rinse, wash, repeat. Y'know, do something about it, and not wait around for false prophets like Irimias and his bumbling sidekick Petrina.- - - - - - - - - - - - Gonna end this on Petrina's Our Father prayer, because I think it's hilarious and a prime example of how the film just didn't capture that it quality of the novel for me:Our father . . . um, our father Which art there, art, art in the sky, er, in heaven, let us praise, er . . .hallowed beour lord Jesus Christ, no . . . let them praise . . . no, let us praiserather, let them praise Your name, and give us this . . . what I mean is, let everything be according to, er, whatever you want . . . in earth as it is on earth . . . in heaven . . . or in hell, amen . . .Amen.",5,satantango

Once the setup is done and the catalyst for the story is revealed, it's one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat from the start. and that at times gives off Succession vibes with the acting of its characters.",4,the-celebration
19683,"Period pictures are almost an anesthetic to me unless presented in the most unconventional of ways (i.e. The Favourite), and for much of the first half I was worried that I was wasting the absurd craftsmanship of the movie on a mind that couldn't appreciate it's merits. However, Kubrick's subversive streak was present from the get-go, and the introduction of the Lyndon clan brought the narrative hook I needed to ground the wonders of the presentation. The card game scene, specifically, is the most clear-eyed vision of attraction I've ever seen in film, and the type of acting that makes this scene great is consistent throughput the whole film. The beauty of the score and godly cinematography perfectly capture the veneer of luxury that such period stories are celebrated for, but Barry's avarice reveals the truth behind why this excess was created in the first place. The fact that we romanticize the lust of our predecessors is absurd, as Barry is emblematic of every ugly truth behind the systems of empowerment we have had to face since the dawn of civilization; that a film could be so subtle and brutal in communicating this point is remarkable.Essential, just as much for it's moral truth as for it's brilliance in construction. I'm ecstatic that I still have so much Kubrick left to see, as he could make my most disliked genre be spellbinding to watch.",8,barry-lyndon

4115,"16/100100 Movies During Quarantine: #66City of God was released in 2002, written by Paulo Lins and Braulio Mantovani, directed by Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles, and looks at the City of God from multiple perspectives of its inhabitants. Now I don’t have many of these, but, at least according to my rating, this is my hottest take yet with approximately 0% of people agreeing with me according to Letterboxd. That would beg the question, why the hot take? Well, that would be because this is a bad movie.Uh, I guess there were a few things I liked in this movie so I can go over those. It was kinda interesting to see the kids grow up and change over the years(but not that great as I’ll explain later). The music made it pretty engaging(but is an issue as I’ll explain later). The real highlight is the cinematography. The handheld shots and quick cuts are perfect for the gritty intensity that is desired in this film. Other than that the only real good thing I can say is that it’s pretty entertaining(which is also a bad thing as I’ll explain later). I mean I certainly wasn’t ever bored, and the way the story is told is pretty engaging. So, uh, entertaining and good cinematography.So, anyways, this is a bad movie for a great number of reasons. I guess the easiest place to start is with the characters. I mean it is somewhat interesting to watch them grow, but overall none of the characters are the least bit layered. This movie is told through little stories of each character, and as such prevents any of the characters to be understood or thought out. Each is simply defined by their 20 minutes of screen time and who they do or do not kill. The characters are engaging and some even likable, but they are largely cartoon characters(which leads to a massive issue I’ll speak on in a minute). Everyone in this movie is so unbelievably overexaggerated that you can’t believe them in any meaningful way. The most you can say about a character is a one-word adjective: cool, camera, psycho(you know exactly who I’m talking about if you’ve watched the movie). This makes all of them hard to invest in or care about, so I just kind of stopped engaging with the movie because all of the characters had so little screen time I couldn’t engage with any of them. This led to even bigger issues in terms of the “bad guy” of the story. The “bad guy” here is a psycho-pathic, serial-murdering rapist with no morals, and yet I’m really not bothered by any of it. I know intellectually that he’s a horrible person, but I never feel that emotionally because based on his screen time and the tone of the movie, I never get to the point where I know him enough to hate him or feel tonally that I need to hate him because nothing he does is taken seriously. This segues into my second and bigger issue: the tone of this movie. Almost nothing in this movie is taken seriously in the slightest so that when it is you can’t take it seriously. This movie has extremely serious subject matter, but everything has the energy of a discount Scorsese movie(i.e. Fun gangster stuff). This is a huge issue because the movie seems to want me to take it seriously, but I can’t since everything on screen is fun, more or less. This is backed up by the music which I talked about earlier; it creates an atmosphere of a fun gangster movie as opposed to a reflective fictional documentary which I think it wants to be. This makes all the graphic violence on screen meaningless because it’s no longer serious when the tone isn’t either. There are quite a few examples I could point to, but the most disturbing one is when “haha funny sex banana” tone is combined with a man beating his wife to death with a shovel. The discongruity between tone and subject matter here, and in many other places in the film is disgusting to me on basically all levels. Past this, on an overall scale, the narrative of this movie doesn’t work at all. About 75% of this movie is just “before I tell you about this, I gotta tell you about this”, and then doing the same thing while talking about that. Over and over again it tells a small story inside another small story inside another small story and they all add up to nothing. There is no grand narrative. There is no arc. There is no direction. There are just a series of scenes that happen to take place in the same city. This movie just fails in almost every department story and tone-wise, which gives you a movie that is not only offensive but also muddled, confused, and flat in just about every way.City of God is a bad movie. That’s it. It’s kind of entertaining, but it’s definitely not good, and definitely morally objectionable. I guess everyone loves this so check it out if you want, but I don’t understand that sentiment in any way because this is a bad movie. It’s not the worst thing I’ve ever seen, and pretty entertaining throughout, but geez is this movie bad.

33971,"Sinegang Second Cycle Weekly Pick #5Rec. by AnggeAngelopoulos does a great job at tugging at the audience’s emotions, some might even go so far to say that he does it in a manipulative way especially with that scene.

26417,"Probably the most uninviting movie there is due to its 7+ hour running time. An endurance test in epic proportions. The film's astonishing length is no joke, but it is essential to its poetic meaning. The runtime allows you to delve deep into these characters lives as they fail to escape their conditions and slowly fall into decay. ""One step forward, two steps back"" tango represents unfolding events and the lives of the characters, who always move forward one step but end up going back two. Those long shots of them walking into the horizon are nothing but static movement; figuretively, they walk in circles.The only scene that is not ''static'' is the infamous cat strangulation scene. This is the moment when fatal nihilism takes over and kills. The sequence where the child is seen gently petting the animal before it transforms into the audience's greatest nightmare is the only one in the film. At that time, we have to deal with our strong feelings of anger, disgust, and dismay. This is when Sátántangó reaches that rare and precious level of forlorn, honest, straight-to-the-heart-and-soul sadness that is so hard to come by in art.

A tidy combination. But the real focus was the drippy Detective, his story as dull and uninspiring as the blank expression that resided permanently on his face. Also grating was the same scratchy, slow motion style used sparingly in In The Mood for Love that appears far more, a horrible effect that reeks of 90's MTV. Onto story number two. Things are about to get better. Surely. This is the half of the film everyone adores. The part when Kar Wai Wong piques my interest and turns around the plummeting star rating. No such luck. In fact, things got even worse. We dive into the kooky, eccentric traits of Faye, the worst type of indie caricaturisation whose wide-eyed, innocent weirdness is supposed to make us coo along with Cop 663's eagerness to move on from his air stewardess ex-girlfriend.It's safe to say that if a random woman breaks into your apartment, moves everything around, floods the place and locks you out of your own home, a restraining order should be the first port of call. That's not to mention an addiction to the Mamas & The Papas that should set alarm bells ringing before you even get to that stage. I never used to mind that song. Now I hate it.Such a whimsical approach fails to render any reflections of love from characters with little or no chemistry. The humour runs flat throughout and there was never one flickering light of redemption that I may care one little bit about how they felt. Twenty years on the stylistic approach seems significantly dated, in a film that leans on cuteness until the crutch snaps in two.",3,chungking-express

12764,"Ozu’s meditative style grabbed me immediately. Although the emotions of this particular narrative burn slowly, I quickly found myself processing it in a detached, macro way, observing this family and having zero trouble relating their generational struggles to what I’ve been personally witnessing over the past year. My friends are beginning to lose parents. Mine are getting older alongside some recent hardships, and the gap between what my life is and how they raised me seems to be ever-widening. Tokyo Story is wise enough to wonder how tenable the context of anyone’s childhood remains as time marches on, and it’s bold enough to posit that maybe that’s simply the natural course of things. While they’re still around, I long for some kind of closure with the people who’ve loved me the longest, but this film’s power lies in temporal honesty: an ever-changing present dictates that the future doesn’t have to cancel out the past, and vice versa.

84570,"A bittersweet story that would have been more powerful as a documentary. Based on a real-life rehabilitation arts program at an American prison, Sing Sing follows the story of Divine G and the production of 'Breakin' the Mummy's Code'. Despite being set in a prison and following a depressing reality for an inmate, the film offers a warmer tone than one might expect given the enviroment -  focusing on the exploration of male emotions, insecurities, expression and injustices through the power of art, theatre and brotherhood. With a brilliant ensemble - a cast almost made up entirely of former incarcerated men - It'll no doubt receive some Oscar-nominations (deservingly so for Clarence ""Divine Eye"" Maclin). While I enjoyed the story and characters, I found the direction lacking, unimaginative and often irritating. The film lacked levels and very rarely changed momentum, leaving no emotional impact during particular story beats. The actors did their best, often with captivating performances, but a combination of the editing, blocking and sound design just kept getting in the way from allowing me to experience a wider range of emotions with Sing Sing. I felt unintentionally distant.Actually, to be blunt, the music pissed me off. Nearly every scene was drenched in this somber, melancholy score that made my brain feel like it was being drowned. I just wanted it to shut up and let itself breathe; to trust the actors, script & camerawork instead of over-relying on a never-ending score that only brings down the quality of the film. It's frustrating but it came across manipulative - trying to force certain emotions when it failed to edit a sequence correctly. Overall, I feel quite disappointed with Sing Sing because I truly think it's a touching story and there are some wonderful highs here. But on reflection, I think these highs were often in the hands of the cast, especially the ones playing themselves, and I'd love to learn more about their stories & thoughts on the programme they were involved with. I look forward to the documentary that is undoubtedly in pre-production somewhere right now...",5,sing-sing-2023
11855,"Redux VersionI've finally had the chance to watch this acclaimed classic and I have to say that I'm not disappointed at all. From the opening scene, with The End by The Doors playing in the background, everything is set for us to follow Captain Willard in his journey upriver while witness desolation, brutality, ethical and moral dilemmas, and the destruction of the human psyche.Technically is an impeccable film. The cinematography captures the suffocating heat and the vast wilderness of the jungle, production design is detailed, the sound, costumes and score are of exceptional quality. All these elements combine and reach their highest level in the impressive combat scenes.If I'm allowed to have one minor complaint I would say that the last act  felt a little uneven, although there were some interesting thoughts about war, the state of modern civilization and the complexity of humans.All seems to indicate, after a brief research, that the original cut of the film (49 minutes shorter) excludes a couple scenes that I found unnecessary and superfluous. This would lead me to believe that said version, with a more dynamic pace and cohesive, is superior. In conclusion Apocalypse Now is not to be missed.",7,apocalypse-now

60187,"Japanuary 2022. My list here and Ben’s Official List here.Once again I tempt the ire of the internet (should I pre-emptively close the comments)... Folks, I'm glad you all found something here but I think this is pretty dreadful.I will start with what I like. There is some really striking and creative animation here. I like the mixed media stuff as an aesthetic, even if it is pulled off pretty insipidly and merely echoes the far superior End of Evangelion. I like the opening fight a lot because somebody uses the Eiffel Tower as a weapon. And now onto the rest of the film...This feels like Anno has active disdain for the audience. It is an overlong montage of 'this is what the people want'. The whole thing boils down to an exercise in manufactured catharsis; a work predicated around the idea that an artist has been stuck making and remaking a franchise due to its enormous success, in which that's taken out on the audience. Let's just re-insert a whole host of backstories in order to give oh-so-clean resolution arcs. Let's forgive everybody. Let's say goodbye to everybody. Let's weakly echo the ending of the series (which is stunning) via another character, for a couple of minutes, but have no real resonance. Let's give a reason for a dad being a bad dad that makes literally no sense and seems actively contemptuous.Let's use some visuals from End of Evangelion, people really like that. Now, let's pave over how a character (admittedly accidentally) enacted a genocide. Let's find a way to forgive them and let's make it about family. That can close off some arcs. That other character hasn't shown up for a while. Damn. Let's shove them back in, hastily sketch out an arc and have them say sorry or be forgiven. Let's have every character blurt out declarative emotional statements that cycle through the reduced down themes.Now time for a scene of laborious exposition and proper nouns. Let's have new spears, and new angels; let's just talk about numbers adding onto other numbers. Oh, chuck in some puerile sexualisation (it is a rebuild after all). This is a rebuild, so let's make that whole rebuilding thing very obvious. What if we have a character rebuild there identity? Well, let's have a character who is fluent in Japanese spend an hour walking around a commune asking what common nouns are. I think the highlight was 'what is goodbye?', I was waiting for 'what is and?’.To continue listing things I dislike, at one point it just becomes Dragon Ball Z for no reason and declares, apropos of very little, that a character’s sync rate is over 9000 (in essence). And to end this whole ‘movie’, we get some sexual immaturity where a character is gifted with a girlfriend that exists to be objectified.I actually really hate this. I know people really love it. I'm glad they do.I wish I could glean sincerity from it but for me it is nothing but artifice. It is mawkish attempts at emotion directly spouted because that's what the filmmakers think the audience want to hear. It is 150 minutes of 'this is what you want, have it... All of it'. Maybe my wants just diverge from the fanbase as a whole (they clearly do). Goodbye to all of Evangelion, let's pretend this one didn't happen.",3,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time
20555,"Criterion Collection Spine #44A ballerina is torn between her passion for dance and the love of her life, in this stunningly beauty adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's The Red Shoes.""You cannot have it both ways. A dancer who relies upon the doubtful comforts of human love can never be a great dancer. Never!""After hearing so many wonderful things about the work of Directors Powell and Pressburger, I finally found one of their films that I really connected with. The Red Shoes tells the story of a young ballet dancer and a composer who both join a dance company at the same time. Then their talents combine to help the company deliver their smash success ballet The Red Shoes. But when the Producer of the company hears about a romance heating up between the two, the tragedy within this magical tale of dance emerges.   ""Why do you want to dance? .... Why do you want to live? ... Well I don't know exactly why, er, but I must.""As a musician, I have always had a strong love for the performing arts, and The Red Shoes is the only great ballet film I can recall seeing besides Darren Aronofsky's 'Black Swan'. Despite being from the 40s, the dancing sequences felt so modern with all their technical beauty and sensuality presented by the very talented cast. The main character Victoria's bright red hair, makeup, and of course those bold red ballet shoes were all simply radiant in Powell and Pressburger's signature Technicolor cinematography. Far and away the best part of the film was the lengthy Red Shoes ballet sequence, which I look forward to rewatching many more times once I pick this one up on Bluray.Along with all the excellent dancing, I also appreciated how important the creation of music was in the story. For instance, I loved the moment when the producer requested the composer to write a completed score, and he already had one ready to hand over.   Spoilers...The main theme of the story is about portraying the life of a dancer, and asking the question of if one can be a great artist while also loving another person. But I wished the last hour was not so committed to the melodrama of that part of the story. It was basically that part of any musical drama where we see the 'band breaking up', which is driven by the jealousy of the producer who also appears to be in love with Victoria. All this character drama was well done, but I was hoping we would get at least one more lengthy dance sequence toward the end. But atleast this prolonged down period in the story did help to give that moment when Victoria was so torn between love and dance, that she decided to throw herself in front of an oncoming train some extra oomph, which did make me gasp.    The Red Shoes is an extraordinary classic film that does not show its age, and is essential viewing for everyone that has an appreciation for the performing arts.   Thanks for reading.Happy movie watching ... SKOL!",8,the-red-shoes
8886,"A new winner for the biggest gulf between my own opinion and that of Letterboxd at large.  The schmaltz, kitsch, treacle, folksiness, and tackiness were too much for me to bear. Cinema Paradiso is a gingerbread-scented candle sold at an open-year-round Christmas store. Toto the protagonist is played by an awful actor at every age, and especially by that goober of a kid. The main story of foolish childhood love is tremendously superficial. But none of this really matters.  No one's here for the acting or the plot.  Not one of the top reviews on this site mentions the love story.  Everyone's here for one thing: the tribute to cinema.But what does Cinema Paradiso actually think about movies?  If an alien anthropologist had only Cinema Paradiso to go on, what would it report back to its home planet about the importance of film?I'm always attentive to this, because anthems to the movies are usually anathema to me. To be way too simple and reductive, I think movies are good because they make you think, but Hollywood usually says that movies are good because they make you feel.  That's what I expected from Cinema Paradiso: an emphasis on the power of movies to move you.  It's implicit in most of the top reviews on this site, which gush with feeling.  But—and this is weird for something so gooey and saccharine—that's not really what this movie depicts.  We don't see any shots of movie audiences getting swept away by emotion.  No one is transported.  The only time we see anything like that is when the protagonist watches his own home videos.So how do audiences in this movie engage with cinema? We are shown people enjoying movies for two reasons.  Firstly, we see that movies are good because everyone hoots and hollers and cheers together.  Movies are about being a part of a crowd dynamic!  Secondly, we see that movies are good because they're erotic and salacious.  That shot of a row of boys jacking it in public is hilarious and the best part of the movie.  So if you just go by what's shown on screen, Cinema Paradiso reduces the magic of movies to arena sports and porn.  Makes sense: it's Italian.  And to be clear, these are real virtues of cinema!  But they're a far cry from virtues of cinema trumpeted in the more bombastic paeans on this site.  (I doubt many of the cinephiles here would appreciate audiences screaming at the screen like characters do in this movie.) They're also not the properties instantiated by Cinema Paradiso itself, which aims for over-honeyed nostalgic melodrama.I think the source of the nostalgia confuses people.  Cinema Paradiso tells us that movies are good because they're communal erotica, but it isn't especially nostalgic for communal erotica... instead, it is nostalgic for, and absolutely fetishizes, the technology and surrounding paraphernalia of the cinema.  Cinema Paradiso doesn't especially like movies, but it lavishes reel-to-reel cameras and physical film with adoration. It's the cinematic equivalent of a cinephile who collects steelbooks without watching them.  It is a movie that has confused the value of film with the aura of film.I'm using Walter Benjamin's term there: ""aura.""  I read ""The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction"" over twenty years ago now and it's still something I think about often... it made a big impact on me as an undergrad.  Benjamin thought that too many appreciators of art confused what was actually valuable about a work with its authenticity and its physical instance.  If you would rather see the original Mona Lisa than a perfect duplicate, then it's clear that you're attracted to something other than the image itself, even though the proper value of the work inheres in the image.  If you are dead-set on buying a first edition of Moby Dick, it's pretty clear that you care about the book, not the story, but the story is the proper object of respect.  This glorification of a work's aura is rooted in both magical thinking and a capitalist drive for ownership.Benjamin thought that the then-emerging media of photography and film would kill off the aura.  Works of art essentially based in mechanical reproduction have no distinction between an original and a copy.  This, he thought, was good!  But what he was wrong about was thinking that aura is determined by a thing's being an original, or even being unique or rare.  To be fair, he defined aura as something that would disintegrate under mechanical reproduction, but it's clear that the phenomenological features of aura-appreciation have persisted into the mechanical and even digital ages, so I reject that definition.  It is better to think that creation at the source contributes to an artwork's aura, but other features also make an artwork's ownership feel desirable and make its presence feel magical.  Movies still have those features, so aura persists.  Collectors build up huge Plex libraries of digital movies they'll realistically never watch just because having the movies on a private server feels good in some way. Powerful, maybe.  We still see a desire for NFTs, the hoarding of Blu-Ray collectors' editions, etc.I'm not immune to aura!  I know perfectly well that I can get a story's value by reading it on a Kindle, but I still love going into a bookstore and going, ""Mmmmmm... Aura..."" and rubbing the books all over my face.  Physical media are cool, and elements that contribute to aura usually have some aesthetic value of their own!  But I also try to be sensitive to the fact that the value of art is (usually) separate from its physical surround, and culture overfetishizes the physical aspects of artistic media.  Culture caters way too much to aura-lust and the desire to commodify and own art.  This is complicated by the fact that there are genuinely good aesthetic and moral reasons to care about a lot of the physical stuff cinephiles care about: film instead of digital video, the survival of movie theaters, physical ownership instead of streaming, 4K resolution, etc.  But I think that in their heart of hearts, a lot of people who voice these arguments really just fetishize the paraphernalia for the same reason that rich scions buy and own art.  I have some opinions about these issues that are borderline criminal in the movie world.  The most renegade is probably: home theaters are the worst kind of fetishization, and if you're watching a movie alone, watching on a phone is an optimal cinematic experience and beats out nearly any possible home theater set-up.  Get out of here Scorcese and Lynch; I'm on Cronenberg's side.So: Cinema Paradiso is a movie supposedly about the magnificence of the cinema, but it only halfheartedly names crowd dynamics and erotica as the virtues of the movies, instead lavishing most of its praise on celluloid and projectors.  I wouldn't have had a problem with this if the movie hadn't been so often misread as such a tribute to cinema, and if it hadn't also been boring and wrapped in a thoroughly tacky Hummel figurine of an aesthetic.  Ugh!  That said, there are some good moments of specificity, like a curved cactus used as a fruit bowl at a countryside picnic, and I liked seeing the old friend of a theater square turned into a carpark.  I also think there might be some sort of Odyssey parallel being told, with blind but omniscient Alfredo representing Tiresias, but I disrespect the movie so I don't really care to pursue the idea.  The clip they show of that Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses sure made it look cool though.",1,cinema-paradiso

41895,"A true meditative poem about death, captured on film; beauty and pain colliding seamlessly. Long takes of empty landscapes, dirt and dust swirling all around, shadows over taking each other, a pained longing for any form of comfort and interaction, crows constantly around, the sun slowly setting as reality starts to take form, until it's shattered in a few moments. My second Kiarostami does not disappoint.It may be a little slow at points, but it was never not engaging. Kiarostami throws all conventional film making out the window, and instead adopts his own version of transcendental film making, forcing the viewer to project their own thoughts and ideas on Mr. Badii; making you question your own life, ideas, and morals - as all great poems do. Brilliant use of cinematography, and sound, clashing with one another to create some sense of drama, and dialogue that sometimes doesn't work, but mostly does, and always feels guiding instead of preaching (which is really important). And of course, an ending that I never saw coming, and yet, I don't know if it could have ended any other way.This just shows what a genuine treasure of cinema Abbas was.

I remember once reading that many people, witnesses of the industrial revolution, predicted that in less than 200 years, thanks to machines, humans would only work a maximum of 5 hours a week, hehe. Well, in this film it's shown how it was never like that. For now it's still not like that, and it doesn't seem that it will be like that, the tools that we now have, from large automated industrial centers to artificial intelligence, instead of making a better place; as the film shows, it seems that its true function is to increase efficiency, but at the same time to maximize exploitation. So Modern Times, despite the fact that more than 80 years have passed since its release, could well be a film of today. We see the police force repressing protests, union struggles, defending the bourgeoisie and the state, not the people, as it has always been.That is why especially the first moments of this film could be a faithful portrait of contemporary times.

Titles are still pretty rough, but the footage itself is better than a lot of what was being made at the time. Stan Winston’s creature effects are of course a lot of fun. The big issue with the film is the awkward pacing. Slow-motion footage is often employed in scenes where you want energy in the action, and all the energy of the film just dissipates. The cast is pretty rough as well, but it again is more an issue in pacing and direction than performance. It’s a fun concept I suppose, and maybe it could have leaned a little further into the camp tone of its inspiration, The Tingler, because the execution of it is rather lacking.",3,parasite

Directed by the wife of the guy who directed Come and See, both are compliments to eachother in an odd way.A Soviet film on the horrors of war which breaks down its characters psychological atates rather than being an absolute gore fest. The snowy landscapes are impressively captured and feel genuine. The first half touches a necessary state of hopelessness mixed with repition, and here there are some great scenes featuring interactions with civilians and the warring factions. I really love the second act which features the best writing of the film, and the third act is very haunting (perhaps a tad overdramatic?)The film does have some weak sound design here and there.",7,the-ascent
63322,"Film School Drop Outs Week 3 - German Expressionism (1920-1927)Metropolis - 2010 restoration version Death to the machines!Fritz Lang's Metropolis. My first thoughts during my odyssey through this monumental German spectacle came as a natural realization some exceptional works are able to cause. I thought that good movies, the really remarkable ones, seriously are good and will stay good despite of what decade or century it is, or who the hell sits in the White House currently. These films feel no age as they don't know what it means, they merely float in time and hopefully will continue existing forever. Thanks to the amazing restoration work and a healthy amount of luck, I bet I almost felt like same as the people experiencing the premiere of Metropolis in 1927. Whether I'm crazy or not doesn't matter, but I find it incredibly fascinating how ageless can a film be and yet how important piece of history it is at the same time. Lang's visuals in the film celebrating its honorable 90th anniversary this year are still just as powerful and just as striking they have always been. Being the mother of countless marvelous dystopia tales on screen, the metropolis here is uniquely ominous and a delicious combination of modern & postmodern architecture and primitive life. One of the big joys I found in Metropolis was the fact that the city is redeemable unlike various  hellholes made to be corrupted from the very beginning. No matter how wicked and grim secrets it hides under the surface, there is still hope. And don't I love hope. It's the concept of something or someone pure and innocent turning  into the worst possible nightmare, the Antichrist. With or without redemption. Those stories always get inside me over and over again. Star Wars and Darth Vader might sound familiar. In Metropolis the city is already rotten. To top of that the brightest hope of the workers, Maria, is changed to embody all of the sins on Earth. Not the person, but the symbol she represents gets tarnished. In the end of the film's second act these events lead to one of the most unnerving climaxes I've ever had to experience. Everything feels so hopeless that you may want to cry. If anything, it was disturbingly perverse to enjoy something so evil. The films story and especially the main character can certainly be viewed as excessively naïve, but ain't all the dreams like that? Freder, the son of the city's big daddy Joh Fredersen, falls in love with Maria and suddenly feels a need to fight for the rights of all the proletarians. He's fighting for the whole society. Metropolis is, pretty much, a communist fantasy in the end. A communist fantasy which is beautiful because it works, because a perfect communistic society or any perfect society only exist in fantasies. I love this dream, it has a good heart and means no harm. A silly, sincere dream inside of the grim covers. The message it represents is universal and it's those very last moments sealing the idea that strike the final five stars. I wasn't left desiring anything more. People, work together. When I left my German cinema bubble in Finland, I was filled with magic. I was astonished, zealous, simply full of joy. A gift from a land that doesn't exist, a film from a period of time that is long gone. Metropolis achieves what cinema is able of achieving during its finest moments. Sounds, sights, emotions. Fritz Lang's Metropolis is a timeless masterpiece, leaving you feeling more alive than ever.",9,metropolis

Like, it's got a incredible production. Like the spectacle of the film, Is not short of incredible. How many extras they had to have definitely added on to the realism. The acting was solid from everyone. Honestly I only watched this movie because Audrey Hepburn is my favorite actor of all time. I'm glad she is good in this, along with Henry Fonda and Mel Ferrer. But the films pacing, I mean, It just had trouble keeping itself engaging imo. I found myself multiple times pausing it to see how much was left. It's also not super memorable, Which weird considering it's based on one of the most recognizable books on the planet. I feel like all I'm going to remember is that I watched it and it was long lol.

The musical is based on only a sliver of Tolstoy's massive novel, so there was only about a 25-minute window of this film where I was fully aware of what was going to come next, which made for an exciting viewing experience. Or as exciting a viewing experience as you can get from this film, at least. War and Peace, in Vidor's hands, is a real mixed bag. The opulent art direction is lovely, as are the costumes, but the human drama of it all is marred down by the stiff, lifeless script (which was worked on by ten writers, some of whom went uncredited). The leads mostly overcome the script, too, to varying degrees of success: Mel Ferrer makes for a handsome, if slightly unmemorable, Andrei, and it's nice to see him act against Audrey Hepburn, his actual wife at the time; Henry Fonda effectively conveys Pierre's inner life without drifting into caricature; Hepburn is the real star, though, digging into Natasha in all her complexities and contradictions. It's remarkably layered, confident work from Hepburn, who was still in the early years of her career. She's easily the best thing about the film.Otherwise, from the stodgy opening voiceover, all the way up to its rushed finale, War and Peace almost never comes alive as a film worthy of its source material.

The second half was boring, dull, repetitive, confusing, difficult to follow, and I overall I felt completely checked out during the last 30 minutes or so.

51120,"Yeah, yeah. They keep together, balls in hand. And the belief in our Führer in their eyes.I've only seen it once, but I am ready to call Das Boot one of the very finest war films I've ever seen in my entire life. I honestly think it ranks up there with Apocalypse Now, Paths of Glory and Full Metal Jacket but easily trumps all three in how it almost effortlessly brings to life the sheer terror and stress of the battlefield. But in this case the battlefield is the unforgiving sea and the soldiers are sailors cramped inside a steamy dripping tin can that could be ruptured, blown up or sunk at any given moment. This is submarine warfare. This is the worst place on earth. Das Boot truly shows the hellish human atrocities of the soul that war brings out without ever indulging in the exhilarating aspects of battle. Even anti war films can make war feel a little exciting but here its utterly terrifying. You. Do. Not. Want. To. Be. Here.Das Boot may not be an epic in the sense you might think, but I believe it is. Wolfgang Peterson obviously put a lot of love, soul, and brains into this film. This 3 hour titan of a film chronicles German submarine life in a way that has never been matched in quality. Like a leaky submarine, the craftsmanship is seeping from every crack and crease. Its squeezing on you from every angle and even when there isn't much going on, there is just so much to look at. The expertly crafted sets have lots of little things strewn about and moving parts in e background. All the dripping pipes, the valves releasing steam, the personal belongings in the crew quarters, the map books in the captains chamber and the beards and stress growing on the faces of the crew every day all reek of authenticity outside and in. Wolfgang obviously did his homework and the film doesn't slow down to let you in on submarine terminology or German slang and phrases. In addition to the expertly crafted sets and shots, Wolfgang effectively captured the fear and determination of the sailors of the era. Every member of the crew is excellently portrayed; especially Jürgen Prochnow as the stern, hearty and relatable captain. He was a great fucking lead. Even in the most intense battle scenes, (seriously some of the best battle scenes I've ever felt in a film. Yes. Felt.) his confidence and strength was the guiding flame. When the submarine isn't hunting from the depths or diving on the run from a guns blazing destroyer, the men sing, dance, and drink all their problems away. Over the course of the 3 hour film, you get to know these men and the damp metal coffin almost begins to feel comfortable. Seriously, the battle scenes are terrifying (one even made me sweat a little) but the film gets its meat from the common life on the sub. Its actually kind of comfy. When the sailors actually go on the surface for the first time in nearly two hours, it feels strange, surreal and uncomfortable. Cold. All I wanted to do was get back under the water. Das Boot is an utterly perfect and nearly untouchable film. Not a lot of directors would think twice about doing a film that takes place almost exclusively in cramped sets and focuses on extreme tension and perturbed men for 15 minutes shy of 4 hours. But Das Boot is a triumph. I was always one of those twisted little kids who thought of all the sailors I was giving an excruciating underwater death in the board game Battleship. I'm glad Das Boot confirmed that my young thoughts were in fact a sad reality. The film heavily benefits from being told from the German point of view. History after all is written by the winners. So what does the losing side look like? Das Boot implies a tragic truth to that question. As the men of the German submarine stand on their deck and glide past the burning remains of a ship they sank, their grim faces are lit with a harsh red. Then burning sailors come tumbling off the deck. Their faces turn to disgust; still lit with a demon red glow. The world had found their devils. I am sad that I was only borrowing Das Boot from a friend. I would've been glad to have it as a part of my collection.... I stole The Prestige from him and I still have it. Maybe he won't notice Das Boot after a while if I stop mentioning it.....",9,das-boot
33316,"A piece of impeccably crafted experiential cinema that presents its material in a somewhat subversive manner that reads quite well on paper — what if living under occupation was not harrowing, as much as it was simply boring? Melville makes an ascetic exercise, denying the smallest of payoffs, where the echo of its first act as a finale feels like an absolute sledgehammer. However, this approach creates as many flaws as it does points of interest. In its minimalism, its characters become non-entities. Introverted everymen take center stage, subjected to frequent interior monologues as voiceover that yield no personal insight at best, and at worst an expositional crutch (odd, for a film so strong visually). Beyond this, one would think its barebones stylings would extend to its other components such as runtime or scope. Unfortunately, Melville makes the audience feel a fool for making such childish assumptions. One of the rare films that aptly could be called a procedural only in visual structure, not in narrative. Reminds me of Come and See in that its subversion in the form of tedium (much as Klimov with pure brutality) provides no knowledge — I personally had a good hunch that living in Vichy France was quite dreadful, and being a tweed jacket nerd fighting the Nazis wasn’t a fun time. Addendum: After viewing Army of Shadows, I am resolute in the idea that Joseph Shin has no business calling the works of Antonioni (who used boredom as a subject, not as empty stylistic trickery) the cinematic equivalent of a “dried out grape” and “lifeless” if he champions Mr. Melville’s borefest as one of the great films. 6.7/10",5,army-of-shadows

29733,"Life is Beautiful earnestly embeds optimism in the darkest of moments, but with minimal emotional impact. La vita è bella. Benigni's audacious dramatic comedy that substitutes the frequently utilised depressing perspective of the Holocaust for a well-intentioned lighter tone. As with most revered classics, my initial approach is one filled with trepidation. The thought of my opinion being placed in the minority forces me to produce a defensive essay rather than a balanced review, at the possibility of being attacked. Unfortunately for Benigni, I disliked an entire half of his ""masterful"" feature, and was left perplexed as to how it crumbled into emotional manipulation for the sake of entertainment. A Jewish waiter finds the love of his life and starts a new family with her, only for their happiness to be abruptly interrupted when they are taken to a concentration camp. To make light of such a horrific period of time is a brave decision. The cynics will view it as a piece of hyperbolic propaganda with pivotal moments of history being re-written in order to drain audiences of their happiness. Others will analyse this drama and overtly praise its unique perspective for accessibility, offering an obvious thematic premise, that being the retaining of optimism during times when humanity has exceeded a certain level of darkness. However theorising a concept and actually realising it are two very different hurdles. Just as different as the two halves that narratively create this feature. The first and more superior half, is a romantic comedy that relishes in conveying a whimsical aesthetic for the fantastical injection of genuine character development that will instantly grant a smile to every viewer. Benigni's visual flair, reminiscent that of the legendary Charlie Chaplin, provides irreverent slapstick humour that suits the hyperactive performance that he infamously portrayed, instantly making him utterly adorable. Whether it be Guido accidentally storing eggs in his hat (a recipe for disaster if you ask me...) or bumbling around as a waiter. His contagious personality is enough to shine an optimistic light in the darkest of corridors, and that's partly due to the screenplay. A noteworthy series of events, once Guido picks up Dora from the opera theatre, that leads his character into a serendipitously magical direction, is a prime example of writing that emitted a loveable quality. The combination of the script with Benigni's performance, and his solid direction for the first half, had me laughing out loud on multiple occasions. With a glisten in my eye in the hope that this would be a new masterpiece. Sadly, not to be. After a masterfully edited transition that sees us jump forward two/three years, our characters are now in the midst of the Holocaust. Jewish civilians are subjugated to poor treatment before being rallied up and transported to concentration camps. Yet Benigni maintains his level of comedy during this period of time, for the sake of his adolescent son who knows no different. As well-intentioned and delicately crafted as this tone was, it came across as highly insensitive and deceitfully manipulative. Various scenes, in particular the German translation segment, had me sink into my seat with a level of uncomfortableness. It didn't sit right with me in the slightest. The emotional connection with these characters dissipated instantly as soon as they were pushed onto the train, and that's mostly due to Benigni's insistence in conveying an overly ambitious optimistic perspective. The more poignant moments of devastation unfazed me due to the bombastic buffoonery that felt misguided. The heartfelt character development that preceded the second half diminished to establish the scattershot exploration of concentration camp regime. And then, as soon as the supposed ""gut punch"" occurs, it's instantly forgotten about when an American tank arrives to save the day (historically incorrect by the way). It concludes on an appropriate quote regarding life and sacrifice, but at that point it's a little too late when all emotional investment is still lingering around in Italy. Atleast Piovani's score is consistently amazing throughout, capturing that Italian Renaissance aura. It is regretful that I end this review with a shade of disappointment. Whilst technically astute and harnessing a heart of gold, the jarring second half emerges as exploitative rather than entertainment. A dire shame considering how wholesome the first half was. But praise must be given to Benigni for ambitiously conveying a wave of optimism, his personality certainly is infectious. I mean just look at that Academy Awards speech!",5,life-is-beautiful

31809,"I think I prefer my Chaplin in more limited doses. There are portions of City Lights that are right up there with anything that Keaton or Lloyd were doing in this interesting Silent Clown period of cinema. The opening scene with a new public monument being unveiled (remember those? Of course you don't, you're under the age of 100) only to reveal a sleeping Tramp, followed by an overly mannerly extrication is a fantastic start. From then on, it's a station to station exercise. Unless you really, really enjoy the Tramp's thing where he annoys the hell out of everyone around him (I do, but maybe not quite as much as others), there's long slow stretches in this one. The millionaire only being his friend when he's drunk is a pretty good gag, but it wears thin the third or fourth time he sobers up and tosses Chaplin out of his mansion. And the overly sentimental relationship with the blind flower girl is a little cloying for my tastes, though I can imagine it being right in line with early box office expectations. Film heresy of the day: You could cut about half an hour out of this film and it would be better. There are moments of genius, as is to be expected of Mr. Chaplin. The scene where he swallows the whistle and keeps interrupting the singer at exactly the right time, every time, to piss everyone off to the utmost degree, is fantastic, and the way it keeps paying off with inadvertently summoning taxis and swarms of dogs might be my favorite joke in the film. And whoever they got to play the Tramp's boss in the city cleaning gig is a fantastic foil as he haplessly tries to eat his lunch, only to be stymied by an ineffective attempt at handwashing. The real draw, of course, is the boxing match, and this is certainly worth the going. The looney chaos that ensues not only between Chaplin and his street brawler opponent, but also the unfortunate referee, is a great piece of extended physical comedy. Stuff like that makes me sort of lament that we no longer have traveling live entertainment shows where people perform unnecessarily punishing slapstick and pratfalls to get a few laughs, it really is a lost art. And the weirdly coquettish interplay that the Tramp has with his opponent before the fight is hilarious as the undercard to the unrepentant goofiness of the boxing match.",6,city-lights

28523,"Musings on Poetry and InterstellarA friend of mine - a former student and a budding poet, headed for an MFA in poetry program this fall – recently told me that the more he works his craft, the more he finds he wants to compress, the more he wants to replace an initial phrase with a single word or to replace a set of phrases with just one brief phrase. The idea is to create a work full of just a few potent words - words that contain multitudes, so to speak - instead of a work full of many less resonant ones.What he wants to offer the reader, I think, is something like a seed, a latent, fertile thing that, when planted in the reader’s mind, germinates and expands. And his poetry, as I read each new poem he sends me, is increasing in these kinds of compression-fueled expansions. His work is, more and more, made up of compact sets of lines that feed a reader’s delight: they puzzle at first in their bold brevity – but then, as I sit with a particular poem, letting my tongue savor the sounds and my mind mull the possibilities, a meaning will open as with a sudden blooming, and then there's another, and another meaning, until the poem fills all my thoughts and feelings – and I find I have been a participant in that deeply personal discovery that readers of poetry often feel, a discovery dependent upon that unique, intimate interaction between poem and reader.Poets like my friend understand that poetry is not really poetry if it has no reader; to even exist, it, in some sense, needs a reader, a reader willing to grasp, plant, and water those word-seeds. The poet depends on readers for the poems to live. And the reader, likewise, understands that there is very little joy in reading if the poet does not trust the reader enough to allow the reader to do the nurturing, to offer care and feeding to those seeds. A poem, then, might be considered not as a thing on a page but as an interaction, a relationship.  And the greater the trust and investment on both sides, the greater the love, the greater the joy.  As Jeanette Winterson writes in her essay, “Imagination and Reality,” “Love is reciprocity, and so is art.” But if the use of Dylan Thomas’s “Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night,” in Interstellar is any indication, I do not think Nolan understands that about poetry: that latent fertility of a poet’s words, that need for trust between poet and reader.And perhaps he doesn’t even understand how much the visual, sensory building blocks that make up the cinematic experience can be like those potent word-seeds we find in poetry, visual and sensory things that truly bloom only when allowed to be planted in the mind and heart of the viewer.For Nolan does not trust that Thomas’s words contain a potency that needs no explaining, no repetition.Nor does he trust that his own visuals will tell the story he wants to tell.Instead, he lectures through the mouths of his characters, telling us what to think. He harangues with a deafening, ever-present score, telling us what to feel. Virginia Woolf in her brilliant and provocative essay, “How Should One Read a Book,” writes, “The impact of poetry is so hard and direct that for the moment there is no other sensation except that of the poem itself. What profound depths we visit then – how sudden and complete is our immersion! . . . Our being for the moment is centred and constricted, as in any violent shock of personal emotion. Afterwards, . . . the sensation begins to spread in wider rings through our minds; remoter senses are reached; these begin to sound and to comment and we are aware of echoes and reflections.”But Nolan will not let that “hard,” “direct” “sensation” of Dylan’s brilliant words or of his own visuals reach the “profound depths” they have the capacity to do. Instead of being “centred and constricted,” instead of having the joy of “sensation” “spread[ing] in wider rings through our minds,” we have only a strident bombast, and in leaving the theater, we leave with very little that is ours. No relationship has been established, no seeds have been planted in the mind and heart and allowed to grow and delight us with their secret and expansive growth. And it’s not that every piece of writing needs to be a poem to offer satisfaction. And not every film needs to offer the subtle delight of densely resonant visuals that tell their own story, sans explicit explanation. The non-fiction essay and the pulp novel offer their own delights as does a simple genre film - a rom-com or an action flick. But the disappointment here is that Nolan seems to believe that any move towards complexity, away from a simple genre film, necessitates lengthy, direct explanation. We do need those lengthy explanations sometimes –say, in scientific essays and political editorials. But a fiction film is neither an essay nor an editorial - and should not complexity be broached differently, so as to make full use of the unique medium of film, so as to invite the viewer into joys of the cinematic relationship? I try to imagine what 2001: A Space Odyssey would have been had Kubrick put explanations of the monolith into the characters' mouths. Would not the thing lose its potency? As it is, that monolith sits like a provocative weight in the mind, growing in density and meaning throughout the film and in the aftermath of the film, as I sit at home or in my car and ponder.  It grows in meaning and significance exactly because it's given wholly to the viewer, and the viewer must interact with it, decide what it is, what it means. And so the monolith becomes personal. It's no longer exterior to me, but it sends ever ""wider rings"" of resonance through my mind - and it has, indeed, taken on such resonance in so many minds since 1968, that it appears again and again in the film world and elsewhere - and is now a part of our cultural cache, a thing, as Yeats might put it, of the Spiritus Mundi , containing multitudes, containing both Kubrick and his ideas and ourselves. Nolan ought to know all that, for  his use of the monolith in figures of TARS and CASE gives him no excuse not to know it. The monolith needed no explanation to be powerful – in fact, it is powerful still because it lacks direct explanation.Total ambiguity in the realm of art is, of course, frustrating – a slosh of vague symbols with no clues as to their meaning(s) and contributing to no discernible pattern can make a reader or a viewer feel betrayed. There is the other problem, too, that the perhaps the artist is not actually offering a complex or satisfying set of meanings and ideas, and mulling over a work from from such an artist leaves us essentially empty handed. My friend’s poems work because they do not remain, ultimately, ambiguous, and the ideas and meanings they contain, once discerned, satisfy the intellect and heart. It’s worth it to invest myself in the poetry he sends me because I know, as a reader, I will be rewarded for my trust, for my belief that the poem is worth investing myself and my time in. Nolan’s film avoids ambiguity (perhaps) as it layers exposition upon exposition, assuming, apparently, that the complexity of the film is too much for the viewer, but in the end, ironically, the film’s central idea seems trite and unsatisfying, very little more than a shallow sentiment about love transcending time and space.Nolan has the skill, I think, to offer something visually, viscerally arresting and resonant.  But as of yet, particularly in recent years, I am less and less rewarded as a viewer – in large part because, even if the ideas are shallow, Nolan will not give the trust to the viewer that the viewer has given to the films. There is no deeply significant interaction between filmmaker and viewer.Winterson writes of the interaction between artist and viewer, “The exchange that art offers is an exchange in kind; energy for energy, intensity for intensity, vision for vision. This is seductive and threatening.” And then she asks, “Can we make the return? Do we want to? Our increasingly passive diversions do no equip us, mentally, emotionally, for the demands that art makes.” Winterson, here, puts the pressure on us, as art-consumers, to offer ourselves to the art, to be consumed as much as we are consumed – if we want to be fully rewarded by the art. Does Nolan’s work and his level of investment in me as a viewer merit my own return? I am increasingly uncertain that the answer is, “yes.”",3,interstellar

21234,"First half is wonderful, poetic depression almost, easily worth 5 stars. The snow, the bare landscapes, the close-ups of the sad faces, the whole desolate atmosphere. It has the whole time this hypnotic feeling to it. The second half is a different kind of story, it starts a bit tame and slightly boring, but after 15 minutes it’s back to being a masterpiece. It has incredible acting, a chilling soundtrack, fabulous camerawork and beautiful (Christian) symbolic. Really loved how one symbolized Jesus and the other one Judas. The ending is also incredibly well done with some surrealism to it.Strongly recommended if you loved ‘Come and See’, although I think that one was slightly better since it’s more humane with more emotions, here are the characters more walking ideas (idealism versus pragmatism). But when it’s for symbolic storytelling (and close-ups of faces) it’s one of the best.",8,the-ascent

63964,"Ugetsu is an enchanting folk tale, crafted with cinematic deftness, and punctuated with a bone-chilling score.And yet, despite the film's magical construction, I struggled to feel invested in the story it was telling.  Ugetsu's premise is straightforward, relaying a simple tale of morality: beware the allure of success.Witnessing a character's tragic downfall is typically enthralling; however, it helps to know the character who is set to suffer.  The only descriptors for Ugetsu's characters are their vices.  It would have been more effective if we could see their lives before their obsessions take hold.  Then, perhaps, we could get a better sense of their devolution.  As it stands though, it feels overly direct: ""bad men make bad choices, then bad things happen.""Ugetsu is an exquisite scroll containing the barest of messages...

Though I'm not sure.I haven't seen Blue Is the Warmest Color, but it seems like a lot of the criticisms I've read about that film could be applied here. The male gaze in this film is more intense than any I've seen in recent years. The differences between this and the book make it painfully obvious that this is directed by a man, where the book was written by a lesbian.The sex scenes in this were so uncomfortable. The first took up probably less than a page in each respective part of the book (written from both Sue/Sookhee and Maud/Hideko's perspectives), yet was unreasonably long here, and completely unbelievable in the context. The second mimicked a scene from the uncle's books, giving them power they didn't have in the book. The books seem representative of the male gaze as a concept and yet Park Chan-wook seemed to completely miss that point.The uncle, played by a ridiculously young actor with grey hairpieces, is made into a cartoon character with a secret basement lair. The conman (here called ""The Count"") is completely contrary to his literary counterpart, who may have even been gay. He seems to have been changed to better allow straight male viewers to relate to him. The entire third part of the movie goes completely off the deep end, including an almost-rape scene thrown in to give straight men watching another thing to jerk off to.The motivations, thoughts, and emotions of characters are completely thrown out the window. We are made to simply watch A lead to B lead to C with no real connection to what's happening.The fact that people are heralding this as some great work of lesbian cinema makes me shiver. I really wanted to love this film but I wish I could see what they see.",4,the-handmaiden

46645,"9/10A compelling, poetic, and beautiful ode to memories, histories, love, desire, hopes, dreams, and humanity. Most of the film is a medatative look into the minds of the population of a city with a tragic past and a strange present, and the rest is a gloriously colorful look into finding love and fulfilling one's dreams. Peter Falk playing himself is something I didn't know I would love so much. Speaking of which, this is my third favorite Falk film and my second favorite '87 film (it loses out to The Princess Bride twice and Woman Under the Influence once).

85848,"The flaws of Whiplash lie deeply within its grimy veins; the most obvious and pertinent one being a senseless and unabashed endorsement of verbal abuse. The resounding praise for the film, while perfectly understandable, is wholly undeserved. From a technical aspect, it's impeccable. The acting is oscar-worthy. The music is beautiful. But the plot is sadly the film's door to its self-conceited, hateful, transgressive, pro-abuse pitfall that makes the film's quality subvert in its entirety. Let me rephrase - its conclusion is the issue; as the abusive teacher alongside his abused student emerge victorious, victorious in the sense that they made a connection, but also victorious in the sense that the abuse ostensibly helped the student become more than adept in regards to drumming.That notion is just so infuriating and genuinely untrue, the idea that verbally assaulting your pupils (or anyone, for that matter) is an objectively good thing to do, a thing that positively contributes to their work ethic, as well as making a social connection.The film never fails to impress, never stops being a masterpiece, in terms of entertainment value. But broken down, it's a catastrophic mess of abhorrent ethics and nothing else.",1,whiplash-2014

I did get some of it tho, but not gonna sit here and try to piece it all together lol. I mainly just appreciated the craft, really incredible directing and cinematography. Very cool and stunning shots in here, never thought the movie looked bad. I usually love long takes and this movie had a lot of those and most of them were so good! The acting was all great, mainly near the end, but throughout it was good. I liked the characters mostly, they weren't boring or uninteresting, I was quite invested in their journey for most of the runtime. They all had interesting personalities, the acting helped a lot too but I liked them overall. The Stalker was the best, especially by the end, I was always really intrigued by him. The Writer was cool, had some interesting scenes for sure. The Professor was ehh. I liked him in the beginning and in one of the finale scenes but he kinda just did nothing for most of the runtime, he was fine.The writing was great for what I got. Had interesting dialogue, certainly some parts that made me think and throughout the movie I really did want to try and understand what the movie was trying to say, and yeah got some of it, but yeah didn't fully connect with the movie because I didn't get it fully. Another reason why I can't rate it higher is because of the middle part that really did start to get a little boring. The first act was great, was giving it like a low 8/10 at that point, but the middle dragged for me and at that point I was just kinda out of it. Then the final act picked up a lot but still wasn't enough to push it over a 7/10. A very high 7 tho for sure.But yeah I liked it overall, happy I watched it.",6,stalker

89628,"Sorry, not a big fan. Will I be accepted by the Letterboxd society?Snooze fest. Judge me all you want I didn't like this ""MASTERPIECE"" and I will justify why. After 30 minutes into the film I was yawning at like regular intervals of 20 seconds. My biggest issues with the films generally includes bad writing and BAD STRUCTURE. The premise in itself is brilliant but the film is TERRIBLY STRUCTURED, boy they made a mess out of something which could've been my instant favourite on first watch. I can see that working for many to some extent yes. I can also see some lying wannabe cinephile's pretentiously saying that they love this film. I am no goddamn critic. I am nobody to judge a film that is considered as one of the finest ever made. But If I don't like a certain aspect or spot a flaw in a film (which is a flaw according to me not necessarily in your case.), I will point them out no matter what the reputation regarding the film is. It's structure is more than enough to pull you out of rather an incredible subject matter most of the times. Besides, I couldn't care any less about any character of the film including the protagonist and god awful melodramatic supporting actor's that were not believable even for a second. That's mostly to do with the structure though which keeps you out of it the ENTIRE TIME.Some positives though. Nino Rota's score is worth a mention. I thought the protagonist did a great job in portraying the character who carried the film somehow even though I wasn't invested in any of 'em. And ofcourse Fellini's incredible camerawork was a delight to witness. Trust me I wanted to come out of it saying ""I LOVE IT"" paid a hell lot of attention to every single detail every minute possible. And by the way I am accustomed to Indian Cinema where the films stretch from about 120-150 minutes generally so there is no question of having a short attention span or something. Anyone up for a debate or any analogy or interpretations regarding 8½. I am open to all cause I love to enhance my knowledge on cinema.

25452,"Yep, this was certainly the most ridiculously entertaining Japanese Soap Opera I've seen since Hana Yori Dango :p (It's kinda condensed like a mini series so it makes sense!)Loses a little of its momentum in the 4th Chapter but despite that for me, all the praise here is legit. It's 4 hour long and it's never boring. It mixes many genres/sub-genres and themes in a natural way. It's crazy, over the top, sometimes cringe (intentionally so and that can be hit or miss) but also genuinely moving when it wants to. The characters are memorable. So is the score.The super romantic ending SLAPS and I have a new favorite hand holding shot. And we all know how important that is. 😌 Below the surface of the guilty pleasure aspect of its tropes/plot, (just read the no spoiler plot synopsis) it actually does deal with sexual pleasure and guilt SEE WHAT I DID THERE 😅  and says something about love, sex, abuse, hypocrisy, religion, crazy cults and what it ""means"" to be a good or bad person, among all the crazy shenanigans. Also everyone naturally has amazing Kung Fu moves.You all have already listed all the things this movie has that are worth listing but let me add this since I didn't see it:Also counts as the second movie I know that uses Corinthians XIII perfectly after A Walk to Remember (yeah AWtR only uses part of it but it still counts don't @ me)",7,love-exposure

In a way, I'm kinda glad that's how I went into this. It definitely isn't the most polished film out there, nor is it the most well-written, but it still hits all of the emotional beats it means to. The story is somewhat simple, but that's what keeps you engaged. So much of the film takes place inside the actual ""green mile,"" and that really helps you bond with the guards and prisoners alike.So when the prisoners all inevitably have to get executed, you feel like you're losing someone you've come to know very well. Honestly, I feel like that was the film's biggest strength overall. Was I a sobbing, blubbering mess? No, not really. But I teared up like a motherfucker.",7,the-green-mile
67593,"Not anything out of the ordinary in terms of plot and cat and mouse-like  structure (crime chase/hitman). But the super coolness and lack of emotion from Costello (the vigor of a ‘samurai’ in some ways), by means of a grey tint, were an interesting beginning  to French New Wave. Keen precision also goes a long way for Melville here. Without it, there wouldn’t be a whole lot else to really take in and experience. This is definitely due to its slowness and way of building up a huge suspense , instead of overloading the viewer with action that has no meaning or real enjoyment. Melville seemed to believe that a slow burn here would really bode well for modern noir and the ability to not be so loud when telling a story about crime. Fine tuning and perfecting scenes that would seem simple or boring to an everyday director, Melville’s dogmatic attitude towards this style pushes him to put all of his effort into simple yet polished scenes.  To further pace and build up this use of structure, Melville’s seemingly tranquil crime-drama could put some viewers to bed, OR … make them so eager for that last stretch that it puts the cherry on top of it all. So be patient with it if you want something out of it.",5,le-samourai

5169,"☆""It's dark still.""""It's always dark here.""☆Every nightmare has an end.I laughed through the silly The Fellowship of the Ring, I yawned through the boring spectacle of The Two Towers, and now it's time to see if I can survive the never-ending and bloated finale of The Lord of the Rings epicly overrated trilogy, The Return of the King.This movie won Best Adapted Screenplay? Get the fuck out of here.At this point my main criticism is about the ridiculous characters, all of whom I don't give a damn about. I actively hoped several of them, especially the moronic hobbits, would be killed in vicious ways. How is it that I spent over nine hours with these men -- all men, always men -- and feel like I don't know anything about them except for ""that one's an angry dwarf"" and ""that one's a wizard who never seems to do anything"" and ""that one shoots arrows real good"" or whatever? Again, I understand that the novels are beloved. But you shouldn't have to read a book to understand a movie, right? I feel like all fifteen of these characters have a backstory that I will never understand even though I watched them for like 600 minutes. That is not the trait of a good trilogy. Nobody could say that about Star Wars, despite having endless lore and tales you could read about the original trio of films, if you wanted. But no one needs to do that to understand absolutely everything in those wonderful films. Here? You're missing crucial information just because you didn't read Tolkien's books. There are no twists, no sudden reveals, no moments you couldn't have predicted two films ago. Every scene that's supposed to be emotional is just telegraphed with brutally asinine dialogue and stilted acting. Yeah sure the movie regrettably won eleven Oscars. But was it even nominated for a single one for a performance? No, thank goodness it wasn't, because every actor here -- again, except for the incomparable Andy Serkis -- honestly looks exhausted and bored. Once again, it's a crime that Peter Jackson saw no need to put any kind of diversity into this entire series. It's not fucking hard. These are fictional characters, Pete. You could have made them look however the fuck you wanted. And you made them all White, despite them all basically being from another world. Jackson is just a rampant fanboy. There's no enthusiasm or art behind the camera here, only blind devotion to his lord and master Tolkien, replete with every ludicrous ""[stupid name], son of [stupid name]"" introduction and time-wasting speech about honor or creed. The dungeons and dragons genre isn't re-created in any way, just slavishly adhered to with higher production values and tons of computer graphics.Aside from the regrettable lack of diversity, and yet another terribly stereotypical sense of gender roles, Return of the King leans into a disturbing direction with the ""enemy"" of the Orcs, who have one mindset and are never given any names or personalities. Why? It's easier to hate an ""other"" if they're devoid of character or nuance. Almost every other human or elf or hobbit or wizard is beautiful and good and righteous, though of course we have shades of that and some nefarious folk thrown in there. (Notably, they all get their comeuppances, just so you don't get confused with any moral lessons.) But the Orcs? Dark-skinned, angry, slobbering, ugly, maniacally attacking in hordes to their certain doom. Aragorn literally calls out ""stand, men of the West!"" to fight against this monstrous swarm. What is this, the Christians versus the Moors? Tolkien isn't even hiding it now.Near constant hyperbolic self-importance and overbearing seriousness in this ludicrous finale simply grows exhausting and laughable, with multiple codas and ending after ending after ending, relentlessly repetitive and never knowing when to just fucking stop. ""Yes Mr. Frodo, it's over now."" NOPE. Still another goddamn 30 minutes! Excessively pandering to other fans is the downfall of this bad film, yes of course a spectacle (albeit an empty one) and an achievement in design and effects but also too reliant on them, this was a redundant mess and epic waste of time other than to complete a bunch of Letterboxd lists.

26454,"I originally wrote a stupid joke review for this movie, but I'm slowly realizing that I care about this movie too much to just write a three word review and move on.This movie is a pretty solid hour and a half movie masquerading as a masterpiece of cinema simply by being about four times longer than most other movies. It doesn't help the story for it to be this long, and if anything it made it harder to follow for me because of the massive length between all of the important plot points which I was expected to remember.You can argue that it helps the mood of the movie by showing the mundanity of these people's lives and by making the characters feel real, which I can agree with, up to an extent. Other movies have done this to great effect, but those didn't feel the need to add a ten minute scene of cows walking around or a twenty five minute scene of some girl walking around with a dead cat. Films like The Assistant captured the mundaneness of someone's life with a scene in the beginning of someone just doing their job for a while, but that movie was still only an hour and a half long.At a point I just decided to think of the movie as a sort of a miniseries before miniseries' existed, Satantango is seperated into about ten different parts already and the length is about equal to some series', Sharp Objects for example is only ten minutes shorter than this movie, but even this doesn't work because NOTHING HAPPENS. One of the parts is quite literally just some people dancing and some guy rambling about what happened earlier at the bar. If this was a miniseries you best believe nobody would be praising it. Let me emphasize, the length of this movie isn't my problem with it, I did choose to watch it after all, it's the way the length accumulates. There is a large amount of the movie taken up by someone looking into the distance for about a minute and saying nothing. There are a significant number of scenes of people walking which probably take up a solid half hour at least of runtime. The same effect in this movie could be made by taking any other movie and taking every single time that someone isn't talking and slowing down the footage to ten times slower than normal.This should not be a seven hour long movie. If this came out today and was HALF the length people would still call it boring. I could easily edit this movie down to an hour and nothing would be lost. Apparently this was based on a book and from watching this I assume that the book was 10000 pages long and had one word on every page.",1,satantango

80104,"Secret Mitchell #15 - For Mitch CappsWe cannot manifest progress without time, awareness, and tender care. Like proffering to his most precious garden, is how I find Paul Thomas Anderson’s ambition for Magnolia, and as with most things done in our youth (he was 28) ambition may blind one from the stifling ability to do “too much”. There’s an innate quality to fate and synchronicity and providence that speak for themselves, in which their impact is diluted when turned into a forceful point. The innate meaning of those words and their provinces should breath on their own, and as gardeners or filmmakers, we should allow photosynthesis to do its thing. The awesomeness of the Divine is much less impacted by being unrealistic as it is for the various line deliveries and wavering tone jolt one out of the realm of filmmaking magic. Paul Thomas Anderson is a great director, whose two films Boogie Nights and Magnolia are misaligned in their final form. Their messaging on family, redemption, and love are always welcome lessons that don’t excuse the overly-bloated nature of the film. Some of the flowers within this garden belong (John C Reilly, Melora Walters) while others are mismanaged weeds (Julianne Moore, Philip Baker Hall, Tom Cruise, Jason Robards, the Steadicam, the editing, the pacing). Even the flowers are misplaced in a way, pointing to the phenomenon that is “directing”. The best comparison to be made is how folks react to Nic Cage and his enigmatic style. It greatly depends who the director is for his shouting and rampaging and blank stares to be made proper emphasis. Now this can literally be said of any actor and director but I think it is more obvious with Cage. Take this experiment to “The Dying of the Light” vs 2017’s “Dark” to see the point at hand. With more discipline and awareness Anderson could have turned the performances in this film into something much better than they are, as also evidenced by his astounding ability to pull career bests from Adam Sandler, Daniel Day Lewis (twice), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Joaquin Phoenix later on. Ambition can be a great thing, but in our youth we tend to squabble it, or merely misplace it, and that's ok. I don’t think there is any current better example in cinema than Paul Thomas Anderson’s growth as an artist.",2,magnolia

This film is STUNNING, so gorgeous to look at, and it desperately needs every single ounce of 4K HDR restoration they can throw at it. I want to be consumed by the textures and colors of this movie. For as beautiful and stunning as the visuals are, the story and themes are even more profound -- and important. A tragic look at class systems, particularly that of misogyny and sexism. Here we see four women, pitted against each other, scratch and claw for the approval of their master. It's a bleak look at how men dominate women -- but beyond that it's a lesson of how the ""peasant class"" can be made the believe that they are against each other by their ruler. When, if only, they realized that their numbers would be stronger in toppling said ruler should they cast aside their pointless feuds and work together. But the movie reiterates that they are not at fault for the fighting and treachery between them. No. The fault is always in the master. These four women are trapped, highlighted by the production design of the film, in which the palace that they stay is a labyrinth of walls a roofs, with no escape. There is no escape for the lower class while we just fight each other.

I mean…okay, when Roger Ebert reviewed this, he was kind of poking fun at people upset about this being a comedy focusing on the Holocaust. My problem isn’t really that, but that the humor just wasn’t landing in general. Benigni’s point in making a more lighthearted film set in that time is well established, and I get it. The foundation just shakes really early, muddying the message and the point way too much for me to appreciate the film as a whole. At the risk of sounding like a buzzkill throwing tomatoes at everyone’s good time, it’s just not my tempo whatsoever.Fucked Up Shit Ville Score: 2/10",2,life-is-beautiful

This is a painfully slow 2 hour long movie, when it easily could have been 20 minutes shorter. The acting in this is great and the actual premise is intriguing and so unbelievable that it works.

His review on this film here!Pony-tailed hipsters observe man, they wander eyes wide, wondering of the human condition. The endless navel-gazing is pedantic murmuring, where thought after thought is just existential crises and not ""hey, what's going on for dinner?"". In reality, thoughts never come across so clean, so straightforward, and highly proficient in incisive thinking and infinite organization. Less a matter of realism and more a consequence of heavy handed profundities that may be poetic but hardly sound so. All my affinity here goes to Peter Falk, the sole American in a sea of foreigners, who translates jumbled thought with nuance and sage wisdom, speaking it in his paternal yet street-smart way. He is the only individual who sells what the film wants you to buy, which is, bridging the gap between reality and the film's magical realism. He tells hipster Ganz that he must learn these things (human things) on his own. It is because Falk can tap into such warmth and unpretentious musings. He is the ""every man"". The premise of Wings of Desires sounds poetic as well--an angel falling in love with a human!--yet the very thought of an angel sacrificing his biblical duty to partake in the sins and vulnerabilities of man, does not win any morality play and this hijacks what the film sets out to do. Here is an existential crisis film averting purpose. The desire of the angel is a hollow gesture decorated with platitudes.

69645,"This is definitely my favourite and surprisingly most accessible Tarkovsky film I’ve seen so far. And when I say accessible that is by no means to say that it’s direction and craftsmanship is any simpler than any of his other films. I mean it in a way of personal connection. Both the Mirror and Stalker left a profound impact on me, but not quite on the level that this film has. To me this is a journey into the world of a man’s psyche, framed as a science-fiction mission story. It’s ultimately a story of grief and how when we lose someone, they live and linger in our minds. Just as his dead wife does. She lives, dies, and is resurrected multiple times, which is a representation of how our thoughts progress when we envision and mourn someone we lose “what if it ended differently”. We can’t escape and change the reality that they are really gone, even if we want our minds to imagine another path where they might have lived.",9,solaris

77901,"""Once we start, there's no turning back.""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days is a Romanian film directed by Cristian Mungiu which won the Palm D'Or in the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 confirming the resurgence of the New Wave of Romanian Cinema. Other Romanian films that have been a part of this movement include 12:08 East of Bucharest, The Death of Mr. Lazarescu, and Tales from the Golden Age. I'm on the minority here when I say that I didn't enjoy this film because the film has won several important awards and has been considered a masterpiece by most critics. As much as I wanted to enjoy this film, I have to be honest and say I felt it was a dull and boring movie. I tend to enjoy these character driven dramas, but I really never felt connected with the characters here and never felt the suspense that most people felt when they watched this. There were a few enjoyable moments and some strong performances, but the plot was simple and I never was drawn into the story. Despite the great camera work and the excellent craft, I never was attracted to this film or cared for the resolution. I'm sure it depicts perfectly the era when Romania was under Ceausescu's communist regime, but having seen so many foreign films focusing on social issues I didn't think there was anything special that stood out here, but I'm probably wrong because everyone else seemed to have loved this film.The film takes place during the final years of Ceausescu's communist regime in Rumania and it centers on a college student named Otilia (Anamaria Marinca) as she begins to make plans in order to help her roommate, Gabita (Laura Vasliu), have an abortion. We don't really find out about the abortion until 30 minutes into the film, but the trailers take away the suspense. The communist regime doesn't allow birth control nor abortion, so they have to do things quietly and secretly. Otilia arranges to book a reservation at a hotel and picks up a doctor who has offered his service, although it won't be free and it will cost them a little more than money. His name is Bebe (Vlad Ivanov) and he takes advantage of Gabita's desperation to have the abortion and her friend's willingness to help. Everything has to be done quietly in the hotel room because if they are caught they can end up in jail, but Otilia also has to deal with her boyfriend Adi (Alex Potocean) as she has promised to visit him for his mom's birthday.  There are a lot of things at stake here, but Otilia is determined to help out her friend.One of the main issues I had with the film was that I never believed the friendship between Otilia and Gabita was strong enough for her to go through such extreme measures in order to help her. They seemed pretty distant and I never understood why she was willing to help. I have my theories, but the film is purposefully ambiguous. It is slow paced and nothing really happens. I don't have an issue with this because in films like A Separation it still worked for me because I connected with the characters. Mungiu portrays the era really well and never takes sides on the pro abortion or pro life issue, rather focusing on the dangers of the oppressive regime. It is a very realistic and dark film and Marinca gives a strong performance as the lead character. The best part of the film however was the scene where Ivanov's character manipulates the girls in the hotel room. He was great in that scene. I'm disappointed that I never got to appreciate the film as much as everyone else did, but there is no denying that  Mungiu directed a memorable film.",4,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days

Today, I shall start my Black and White movies binge!Now that I've gotten my HBO Max - I mean Max - working, I can finally watch a lot of the black and white films I've wanted to see for ages! And since I was gonna watch a lot anyway, I decided to go one step further and find every single Black and White film I can find on any streaming service I have. So here's the plan:First I'll start with all of the Akira Kurosawa films on Max, then I'll do a bunch of random stuff in between, and then I'll finish it off with Alfred Hitchcock, (and hopefully end it all with Psycho). If you guys wanna suggest anything, you can say so in the comments. Anyway, as for this film? Yeah it's really good! This is my first Kurosawa film, and I feel it's a great starting point. I realised 30 minutes in that it was an adaptation of Macbeth, but I feel it takes the basics of that tale, and improves on it with multiple expertly crafted scenes. While I didn't enjoy the first 20 minutes, the final 20 REALLY make up for it. The arrow scene is just utterly phenomenal in every way. So yeah! Can't wait to see more of Kurosawa.",7,throne-of-blood

18368,"DISCLAIMERLike Claire Ramirez did on her review of The Thin Red Line, I think I'll have to say that this is my opinion on this so-called 'masterpiece': something that we're all entitled to. I know that people love this film like mad, but...well, I don't. Thanks.""You're too polite!"" - Mrs KooThere is very little going on in this film. Very little to care about. It's like they've tried to make a subtle film (which it is), but made it so subtle that there is literally nothing left except what there is to look at. It's so subtle that it doesn't even have a feather-light touch. It's non-existent for me.With all this negativity, I better focus on some good things. Despite under-playing to a degree that could be seen as parody in any other context, the two leads, Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung are pretty good. Not phenomenal, but pretty good. They've got to carry the film between them, since there are only a couple of minor characters who have any sort of relevance to the film and the two other catalysts are off-screen. There is true chemistry between them, but chemistry that is nearly invisible because of the film's manic sense of subtlety.And it looks absolutely gorgeous. In terms of cinematography and production design, this is a true masterclass; the interior design looking good enough to eat. You can practically smell the noodles that are ever present in the apartments it's so immersive.Pity about everything else. The script felt achingly restrained and more than a bit pretentious (the title cards drove me up the wall) and the pace was just not there. I was expecting a compelling story of forbidden love and under-stated passion, but what I came away with was two people sitting around, eating noodles and feeling paranoid and depressed. When I thought things were going to pick up, it falls into those god-awful slow-motion scenes where the same piece of mournful, graceful music plays while the characters either walk around, smoke, visit the noodle bar or share glancing looks. At first, this is a nice trick, but when it's used about nine times throughout the film (about nine; I was too bored to count properly), it becomes irritating and painfully self-indulgent.I'm sorry, but I was not entertained by this movie. There was no humour, no redemption, little coherent plotting towards the end and no resolution. I didn't like it. I might come back for the sequel. Maybe.",3,in-the-mood-for-love

34581,"Film 9/20 - March Around the World 2020 - DenmarkI’m an atheist, but I believe in the power of belief. Carl Theodor Dreyer’s film, Ordet, sets out some of the bad and the good aspects of faith - showing how it can divide families and communities just as it can unify and restore them. The film is based on a play written by a priest, and the film’s tenor is clearly one of devotion. But there is a surprising amount of candour in its depictions of doubt and even non-belief, which means it has many entry points, regardless of your religious views. Ordet centres on the lives of a farming family living in rural Denmark in 1925. The head of the household is Morten Borgen a widower, and the father to three sons. Mikkel, the eldest, is married to Inger, with whom they have two daughters and a third child on the way. The youngest brother, Anders wishes to marry a neighbour’s daughter, but religious differences mean the respective fathers will not agree to it. And the middle son is Johannes, who Is touched with madness, believing himself to be the return of Jesus, damning those who have no faith. As he sees it: “I am the light of the world, but the darkness does not understand it”.Over the course of the film, the Borgens are faced with a series of crises. In particular they will struggle to contend with the mental health and try to ensure the physical safety of Johannes; they’ll try to resolve the damaging religious intolerance exposed by Anders’ desire to marry; and they’ll try to help Inger through a difficult and traumatic childbirth. And across each of these dramatic battlegrounds, Dreyer will test and challenge his characters’ faith, as well as their humanity. Dreyer takes his time to weave the story into its themes, and this gives it both a natural flow and an intricate, interior tension. What I found particularly fascinating was how the famous miracle scene’s depiction near the end of the film succeeds both literally - arising out of pure religious devotion - and metaphorically - arising out of human empathy and reconciliation. The film doesn’t succeed because it is a parable. It succeeds because the characters are real humans with real concerns, who we care for and cry for. They are decent people, stoic and stern, but also loving and respectful, and vain and flawed. They get their miracle because they are good people. And the film is a masterpiece because it is a great humanist drama, that also happens to be about religious faith and devotion. Ordet is a graceful film. I’ve read there are only 114 shots and most of these are slow and measured.  For me, the miracle of the film is less about its depiction of physical resurrection, and more about how its gentle rhythms are able to generate such an intense emotional impact. I thought I had the film’s measure - I was enjoying its depiction of the family and I was sharing in their dramas, when suddenly, and without any hint of cynical manipulation, I was streaming tears. It completely caught me by surprise. I’m tempted to liken Ordet’s story of faith, humility and reconciliation to that of an immense, gently swelling ocean breaking upon the shore. Much like Dreyer’s Jeanne dArc, Ordet is a film that has the capacity to restore your faith in cinema.",8,ordet
49358,"Extremely exhausting and reprehensible for a multitude of reasons, and we've already seen a lot of the same issues in other recent ""Asian diaspora"" or ""Asian themed"" works (Shang-chi, Turning Red, After Yang, Love Hard, Eternals, Blue Bayou, the list goes on and on). The central drama of EEAAO (god I fucking hate the title) has never moved beyond the tired and recycled narrative involving generational trauma or the tiger mom/overbearing Asian parent stereotype. It's honestly so reductive and unproductive to frame the majority of the conflict in a way that echoes the equally reductive and unproductive discourse on Asian families that is more concerned with antagonizing Asian parents or Asian children and less concerned with the social or material conditions that caused such conflicts. Yes, these situations exist, but there's a reason why we keep seeing these types of Asian diaspora stories in Western media instead of something new for once, and it's so tiring to sit through them over and over again. The best Ozu or Yang films never resorted to utilizing this model of a family drama. A family member doesn't need to be singled out as an ""antagonist"" just to move the plot forward. Why even antagonize mothers or daughters? And if you're gonna antagonize the women in the family, I just find it obtuse to only render the women as villains while the husband gets the pass. And no, I'm not gonna racialize this dynamic as an ""Asian patriarchy"" thing because that's also as reductive as reinforcing ""Tiger Mom"" or ""Asian matriarchy"" stereotypes, and racializing issues existing in Asian societies as an ""Asian"" thing, or calling any Asian society ""backwards"" for merely having these issues, or even masculinizing or feminizing race, subscribes to white supremacist narratives.Yet the film can't help but recycle so many racial stereotypes. The close-minded elderly patriarch, an Asian laundromat, martial arts, Asians who defy their parents and move to America, a confused yet rebellious 1st generation kid with immigrant parents who embraces the rebellious Asian Baby Girl aesthetics, etc. etc. Any of these, including the family shit, wouldn't be an issue at all if the film has made any significant effort in not only subverting, deconstructing, renegotiating with, or repurposing the cultural histories and ramifications of such stereotypes existing in Western media but also facilitating anything close to the immense complexity that the Asian diasporic experience possesses. But EEAAO offers little to no nuance on any of the topics related to them. Much of the dramaturgical mechanisms and narrative conventions serve to offer ""lived experiences"" that only exist in distorted forms. Most of their construction involves enough recognizable signifiers associated with ""personal experiences"" so that diasporic Asians are encouraged to accept some level of ""relatability"" even though much of what they find ""relatable"" comes from a set of racial stereotypes defined or further reinforced by non-Asian (white) people. Even Asians themselves can be complicit or inadvertently participate in perpetuating said racial stereotypes. If a racial stereotype successfully resists any meaningful subversion, deconstruction, renegotiation, or repurposing, then what will continue is its general function of establishing and preserving a racial hierarchy that maintains the continuity and growth of white supremacy with a minimum amount of effort, attention, and expense. This ideal racial stereotype requires little maintenance; its effectiveness and efficiency enhance as it becomes purportedly ""authenticated"" and ""verified"" by canonized historical or cultural records made to be perceived as ""reliable"" or ""legitimate."" The fact of the matter is stereotypes operate as models of behavior. They condition society's perceptions and expectations, cognitive structures that contain the perceiver's knowledge, beliefs, and expectations about marginalized groups. Thus, society is conditioned to accept the given minority only within the bounds of the stereotypes they have participated in creating, and the subject minority or marginalized group is also conditioned to reciprocate by becoming the stereotypes, measuring group and individual worth in their terms by living them, talking them, embracing them, and believing them. When the vehicle of such stereotypes, the medium of their perpetuation, and the subject minority to be controlled are all one, where the subject minority itself embodies and perpetuates the white supremacist vision of the reality of their ""lived experiences,"" it results in the neutralization of the subject minority as a social, creative, and cultural force. They no longer pose a threat to white supremacy because they are dependent and even grateful to it. It shouldn't be surprising at all when reprehensible Asian diaspora films like Crazy Rich Asians have been received as landmarks of Asian representation, or that popular Asian social media personalities like Uncle Roger or any goofy-ass Asian Baby Fuccboi who keeps making the same ""oh the most unrealistic/fantastical element in Shang-Chi is the Asian mom saying she's proud of her child lol do you get it because Asian parents would never say that ahaa XD"" jokes gain some semblance of popularity because of their self-hating buffoonery. ffs with the critical acclaim this film has been receiving (among other factors), we're gonna end up with yet another generation of Asian diasporic ""artists"" who make stories about """"""tiger"""""" parents asking their kids for forgiveness or some other dumb, redundant, or reductive shit.Of course, it would be ludicrous to claim that EEAAO promotes white supremacy, but this is yet another Asian diaspora film that fails to address the more important questions regarding how its Asian representation matters as well as for whom and for what does it matter. Failing to address such questions will result in a continuation of an already existing situation where Asian representation is vulnerable to surrendering itself to the disempowerment of the Asian communities that should be benefitting from it. Like Shang-Chi, I see Asian people and Asian culture, but Asianness is merely consecrated and desecrated as ornamental artifice or aesthetic objects that epitomize the congealment of commodification. If Asianness in Shang-Chi is a commodity for annoying Marvel fans, Asianness in EEAAO is a commodity for the insufferable A24 fanbase. So this Asianness is primarily designed to appeal to a non-Asian (white) audience or boba liberals who seek validation through non-Asian (white) approval. Since Asianness is repurposed to suit the non-Asian (white) audience, this is no different from watching a non-Asian (white) movie, or a movie that contains Asianness that also happens to be directed by non-Asian (white) filmmakers. You can tell the Asianness is merely utilized for surface aesthetics when the film, as illustrated by its dumbass title, wants to universalize everything. EEAAO deprives Asian characters of their identity by making their cultural histories and racial/ethnic backgrounds matter less as the story progresses; Asianness hardly matters for the Asian characters because of the film's insistence on committing to its ""universality,"" but this universality only ever amounts to platitudinous ""love conquers all"" writing that cunningly disguises itself with cinematic references and cinematographic tributes to other films about existentialism or nihilism or whatever Rick and Morty postmodern dumbshit the Daniels prefer to make a movie on instead of actual Asian experiences. Enforcing this mode of universalization only makes Asian diasporic stories narrower because the privilege of a ""universal experience"" within the scope of Western media is often a manifestation of internalized racial superiority and Western chauvinism in which all of us supposedly share a ""common experience"" when, in reality, said experience is centered on a very neoliberal, very Western/white interpretation of ""universality"" that ultimately denies a multitude of ""lived experiences,"" only to privilege the more palatable ones for the sake of upholding the status quo.Asianness in EEAAO never expands beyond surface aesthetics because the film itself is also perpetually resistant to any aesthetic or directorial invention. The film is nothing but a pastiche that assaults you with a constant barrage of audiovisual references, emulating the (pop) cultural phenomena of the older works that inspired it, but whatever ""thrills"" this provokes are only temporary. Literal ""theme park ride"" energy. Once it wears off, there's nothing else it offers; dissect the most ""significant"" images in this film and you'll realize you're left with something intellectually and emotionally dishonest. But people seem convinced that artifice and gimmicks are synonymous with ""originality,"" as if synthesizing these filmic references with sophomoric philosophizing is considered ""good"" filmmaking. There's nothing creative, surprising, or audacious about any of this. The Daniels sure love to add every idea into this pastiche, but they seem confident in believing that breadth is equivalent to depth, and for a film that tries desperately to explore the ""truth"" about the universe or optimistic nihilism or whatever the fuck, it comes off as vapid nonsense, especially when the film's message is that of complacency. Oh, the working-class/lower-middle-class roots of these people are actually a result of personal failure and primarily caused by their individual choices instead of the various systems, structures, inequities, or modes of exploitation that directly caused them? Nah whatever dude so long as we love each other this is totally fine lol. You should stay poor because you're exactly where you should be but don't forget to be grateful ☠️ In the face of hardship, so long as you're being kind, everything is fine, because the one thing that's ""everything everywhere all at once"" is ""loveeeee"" ☠️☠️And what the absolute fuck was that Wong Kar-wai reference? The most memorable moments in any Wong Kar-wai film involve unspoken actions. Why the hell would you make your characters in the Wong Kar-wai scene explain everything in excruciatingly verbose detail? There's no depth, no ambiguity, and no sense of poetry in what's been expressed or depicted in front of us.Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan are good actors btw.",1,everything-everywhere-all-at-once

Deep breath, alright, let's do this...I just don't care about Goodfellas. I tried, and I can't. Sure, it's nowhere near the worst movie -- the people behind the camera, the people in front of the camera, the people who wrote the words, everyone here is competent. But the finished product feels overlong and awkwardly paced, seemingly using the constant narration because it wants to rush through so many events, and so many people who almost never matter. So for the entertainment that most people seem to be deriving here, I dunno, it's not for me.I suppose part of the problem is that everyone in this movie is an absolutely hypocritical bastard and I hate them -- and yeah, it's perfectly fine to not ""like"" people who are the subjects of films. I love tons of movies with awful people as characters. But when the argument gets brought out that this is critical of that lifestyle because consequences do eventually catch up... I'm skeptical. I really believe that the way the film is presented glorifies this fantasy of being above all reproach, of wielding power beyond the pathetic ""normal"" people around you. You may get killed for breaking the rules one day, or you might *gasp* have to stop, but that's the cost of making mistakes. The only thing that is truly ugly in this movie is having to be average and not exploit everyone around you. Yeah, the film is all from the perspective of someone who has entirely bought into this life, but I don't think a real distinction is made by the movie. Lots of people come out of this talking about how cool everyone is and it feels like people just fall on one side or the other based on how strongly they react negatively (as they should) to the spousal abuse and murder vs. how much they like the fantasy of doing anything you want and being too dangerous for anyone to risk offending. I suppose it's about trying to realistically show why people would take all of the risks they do by making the highs look truly appealing, but it didn't for me at all. It just felt like a string of terrible deeds for superficial rewards that the film wanted me to believe was appealing.That pasta sauce looked really delicious, though. I loved a few tracking shots, too. I'm ready for people to rip into the long paragraph but it's admittedly kind of rambling because such a highly rated film feels like it needs more than ""I didn't care enough about this to want to really say anything"" but in some ways that's all I've got.

I mean, they’ve been making movies just as good and even better for years) but no one knows about Parasite 1982, the original source material for Parasite 2019. Look, I do think Parasite 2019 was good (it’s a solid 3 stars), but enough already. Don’t talk to me about Parasite 2019 until you’ve seen Parasite 1982. Parasite 1982 really excels at demonstrating the subtle nuances of class disparity, where Parasite 2019 drops the ball and fails at times. The poor people in Parasite 1982 are infected with an actual parasite and the rich man in the black fancy suit who drives a shiny black Lamborghini wants to kill them, even though his economic status as part of the 1% is what caused this huge class divide, he is responsible for creating these poor “monsters” that he hates. I wish Parasite 2019 would have tried to delve deeper into these class issues, but it feels like it only scratched the surface compared to Parasite 1982, and all we really learn from Parasite 2019 is that poor people smell bad to the rich. Bong is a good director (I loved Okja!), but I feel like he could really learn some things from Charles Band, and I wish Parasite 2019 would have stayed a little truer to the source material of Parasite 1982. If Parasite 2019 would have done this, maybe they could have won ALL the categories at the Oscars and not just a handful. While I enjoyed Parasite 2019 enough, I don’t think I’d revisit it.

84009,"The discourse around this movie was already annoying when the predominantly white cast list came out last year and the main response to ""where are people of color?"" was ""oh you want a black Oppenheimer?"" Sure, DEI demands have already led to multiple black villains in superhero movies being responsible for everything wrong with capitalism and the military industrial complex (or, even, sometimes, the heroes, ie Bryan Tyree Henry in the eternals as a god of technology who has the Oppenheimer “what have I done” arc over Hiroshima) and requesting non-white presence in a movie about genocidal white supremacy seems counterintuitive (ie Hamilton). Yet, given how the US destabilized the Congo to mine uranium for the atomic bomb project with at least one person who interrogated Oppenheimer (played by tony goldwyn in the movie) later being involved in the assassination of Lumumba (see: susan williams' white malice: the cia and the covert recolonization of africa) and installing a regime amenable to US rocket programs in the Congo (see Craig Baldwin’s RocketKitKongoKit) or that Oppenheimer himself was one of the scientists who oversaw radiation experiments on unwitting black subjects (see: harriet washington's medical apartheid) it seems really shortsighted to brush off the possibility that there were other ways to include black cast members beyond a Hidden Figures style celebration of black scientists who worked on the bomb. twitter.com/motelabyss/status/1685043554052190208?s=20Like sure, the movie was dogged by opportunistic critiques sight unseen  but who would've expected that the director of the dark knight rises, where occupy wall street protesters are armed with nuclear weapons, cops are unarmed and defenseless, and insane asylum inmates are doing moscow show trials against the rich, written by someone who collaborated with oliver north on a call of duty game with similar politics, would make a movie about the creation of the atomic bomb where communists and fellow travelers are victims of cold war hysteria and the military-industrial complex is responsible for mutual assured destruction.I didn't, but I think it's fine that, whether they have media literacy skills or not, people assumed otherwise and decided to get on a soapbox and use the movie as an educational opportunity in a country that still believes the bomb was necessary. Having finally seen it and read the book its based on i think it acquits itself politically on a number of levels. One, as a portrait of what happens to a compatible non-communist ""left"" trying to have it both ways by sticking to liberal individualism at the expense of collective solidarity, but even there it papers over how Oppenheimer was actually enthusiastically involved in CIA’s Congress of Cultural Freedom, which did a lot of work cultivating a “social democratic” non-communist ""left” but it was also a soft power power arm for the CIA's attacks on African liberation movements (see both White Malice and Frances Stonor Saunders The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letter). With regards to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in addition to ""let's not bomb Kyoto, my wife and i vacationed there"", having Oppenheimer unable even to look at footage of the destruction he wrought when shown it and only able to visualize its effects in relation to americans in his immediate surroundings is a searing indictment in its own right But the responses to detractors of ""what, did you want Nolan to show footage of Japanese people being incinerated?"" shows as much lack of imagination wrt historical literacy in service of art as the media illiterate mob who supposedly only want a film to reflect on their programmatic demands as if it were a checklist. For example, Casey Affleck as Pash is an effective portrait of anticommunism including a surprising reference to US involvement in the white terror campaigns in the Russian civil war but Pash also oversaw Japanese internment camps which unless I missed it gets no mention. In the book it's one line in a paragraph the movie neatly transforms into dialogue from Damon when explaining to Oppenheimer who Pash is. But, not being mentioned beyond that, it's one of a number of incidences where the limitations of the film’s scope can be traced back to the book (although one of the pleasures of reading the book alongside the movie is seeing which passages nolan used screenwriting tricks to translate into scenes with dialogue).In the book that line is sourced from Christopher Simpson’s Blowback: America's Recruitment of Nazis and its Effect on the Cold War"" with no other reference to that book’s focus on operation paperclip, which the film could have used to further underline the irony of Oppenheimer being HUAC'd given ex-nazis got to work on both bombs and biological and chemical warfare (ironically one of Oppenheimer’s defenders against HUAC was none other than werner von braun) with Japan’s Unit 731 to later be used against Koreans. An entirely separate discourse has resulted from discussion of what Unit 731 did in Manchuria, as if the latter somehow justifies the bomb, or that critiquing both Japan's fascism and the bomb are somehow mutually exclusive, as if, aside from the amount of non-military civilian targets of all ages, 50,000 Korean forced laborers weren't also victims of the atomic bomb. Then there's the erasure of Tatlock's own career and grappling with latent homosexuality and, although she's ultimately one of the characters portrayed with having the most political conviction or psychological insight into Oppenheimer's hangups, ends up coming off as someone enirely defined by their relationship to Oppy. The film's reduction of the conspiracy surrounding Tatlock's death (in which coroner's suspected she was murdered, and Pash was a prime suspect given his subsequent involved in CIA assassination squads against suspected domestic double agents and foreign leaders, including Castro) to a brief insert shot of a gloved hand, feels like a cop-out>. Given it's during the color part of the movie that is subjective from Oppenheimer's POV (another fun cop-out when responding to anything limited about the film’s scope) it reads like a visual manifestation of guilt over having caused her death. Kitty too had an interesting life, with a first husband who was a communist that died fighting in the Spanish civil war, and by not dying continues a streak from tenet of breaking with the Nolan dead wife curse. The part where she defends Oppenheimer though was the most ""American Fascist: Your going to the campsAmerican Liberal, chuckling: You're*"" scene of all time.  I didn't see it on IMAX 70mm so maybe i missed something, saw it at alamo on their biggest screen on 70 and the desk lights were distracting during scenes that weren't set during the day, and given Nolan's war on discernible dialogue not mixed into overbearing ochestral sweeps i had to use those noise reduction earplugs that weirdly, and thankfully, isolated the dialogue and made it legible. Given Nolan's history of expository dialogue, being forced to translate an existing text with an army of ""that guy"" character actors ends up improving anything that comes out of his characters mouths by a mile. Again, setting aside how questioning a movie for things outside of its scope is apparently a blight on cultural analysis, seems odd to leave his father out given his father raised him in a specific milieu of well-to-do jews responding to anti-semitic ostracism with an ""ethical culture"" program inspired by Marx, sympathetic to the working class and black civil rights, originally anti-zionist. Would have made some of its portraits of intra-jewish rivalry (and the irony of assimilating into a genocidal fourth reich on the pretense of creating a weapon to stop a third reich) more interesting while also highlighting the links between anticommunism and antisemitism.At one point Oppenheimer tells Truman they should give los alamos back to the Indians and that seems to be the beginning and end of both Oppenheimer's interest in Indigenous affairs and the movie's understanding of the impact of the atomic bomb radiation on the Navajo, which, again, would have furthered a point it was making not undermined it with a programmatic demand to appease representation politics  time.com/6296470/oppenheimer-navajo-uranium-mining-essay/Anyways, one fun thing to speculate about is why the script was written in first person, and what Nolan's version of the Oppenheimer curse might be. Aside from googlebombing searches for his hitman brother who had the codename oppenheimer, maybe he does have genuine regret for the politics of his superhero movies (even though this in parts resembles avengers plots like ""the military is going to do what with the tesseract?"") given that, aside from the goyer/oliver north conneciton, the batman movies were funded by a billionaire who is ""doubling down on a new thesis...backing a variety of AI defense companies like one that enables drone swarms to operate autonomously"" twitter.com/BoltzmannBooty/status/1684270114298789888?s=20When oppenheimer did biopic box office numbers on the level of american sniper it also reminded me of the popularity of shooting and crying pictures in israel, here mistaken for liberal protest art, in israel utilized to further the ruse of israel being a democracy due to its allowance of a genre built around guilt and PTSD from committing state sanctioned genocidal murder. Anyhow, i still need to watch Peter Watkins' the Journey so i'll go take a week to do that. On the upside I did finish pynchon's against the day which has economic and geopolitical considerations far beyond the scope of every recent movie from Indy 5 to this, both in relation to the Congo and the weaponization of science via colonial resource extraction and to whiz kids with sexual hangups who go to Gottingen for science and find themselves benefactors of an industry built on genocide and empire.",3,oppenheimer-2023
49467,"And this is why I generally avoid Oscar bait bullshit like the plague. This feels like gonzo by committee, for committee. A sanitized, commercialized show reel of artistic mediocrity. Pretty sure directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinart have never seen a truly gonzo film in their lives - a Cat III Hong Black Magic flick like Devil Fetus, the battering surreal claw hammer of a Tetsuo or even a regional SOV oddity like Blood Beat. For their faults, all films with beating hearts. This is for people who want conventional platitudes (there's no place like home, love will conquer all) dressed up in zany pinatas that split open to shower them with filmic spangles. But you can't have your cake and eat it. If you want me to feel the emotional beats of a film, don't bombard me with CGI bagels, janitor's closet portals, animatronic raccoons, sentient fucking rocks with googly eyes and parallel universes where everyone has hot dogs for hands. The indiscriminate whimsy is off the charts in this movie, but it ultimately boils down to the equivalent of a cutesy little anime mascot tied to the bottom of a high school student's backpack.Infuriating. It's the kind of over-engineered boardboard zaniness where the directors think throwing everything and anything at the screen to see what sticks is the way to make a movie. This is a random feature... this is a random feature. Despite the relentless stream of shouty, showy action we're subjected to throughout Part 1, there's no disguising this film, like the supermassive bagel at the centre of everything, is hollow at the core. It riffs on the idea (not a new idea, by any means) that for every decision made in life, a parallel universe is spawned where lives play out in different ways, creating an infinite multiverse of alternate realities. The ultimate message seems to be if everything exists, then nothing matters, so why not embrace the chaos. The kind of epiphany stoned college minds arrive at after a night of passing round the bong. And it doesn't even have the balls to go all in with that, to disintegrate into true structural collapse. Instead, it opts for cheap emotional manipulation, largely achieved through musical cues, swelling strings, and heavy application of tear stick to the key players.I don't even hate it really, it just washed over me like a tidal wave of asinine tosh. Michelle Yoeh was nominated for an Oscar? She certainly does a better job than most here with the paltry material, especially Ke Huy Quan's inspid husband for whom gravitas is as unreachable as the Plateau of Leng and Stephanie Hsu as her insufferable daughter Joy. Beyond the lighting, the production values really aren't great either. There's a plethora of bad CG, showy editing in service of little more than retinal stimulation - sound and fury signifying nothing - and a wholly unconvincing evocation of the tech involved in this dimension jumping, activated through such random acts as switching the shoes on your feet, giving yourself a bunch of paper cuts and pressing the glowing green button on your bluetooth earpiece. Some praised Sion Sono's Ghostland for its set dressing and production design, but I didn't see it there and this feels of a piece to me. Especially in the ADHD-fuelled first half where the action flits between realities like a drunk channel surfing, it reminded me of nothing so much as play acting as a kid, LARPing in the garden with sticks and makeshift cloaks; like Ghostland, there's a campy am dram feel to proceedings, and the actors were simply incapable of selling the idea that they were alternate versions of themselves. The back half largely gives way to misty-eyed sentimentality, which is a different kind of hell. To be honest, if this is what passes for profound, mind-bending fantasy these days, then I'll stick to my sewer of exploitation effluvia, thanks. FTM.",1,everything-everywhere-all-at-once

53455,"60/100I started to write a very long review but it started to feel redundant like this film. The opening 20 minutes is one of the best openings I've ever seen. The closing is strong and made me question if I've misjudged this film. But for all the good, there's enough bad, and too much ""I don't care"", that withholds this from being something special. My biggest issues come from the writing and direction. The bulk of the film is the characters going in circles, never really stating something new, or giving new insights, or learning anything. Just the same back and forth that made it feel tedious, and hard to connect with emotionally. Maybe it's just me, but I felt I understood everything it was trying to say by the 45 minute mark, and there was still an hour after that. The direction just felt misguided, because the performances did. Sometimes they were on, and sometimes very, very off.The cinematography and sound design though are not two things to ignore. Simply one of the most visually interesting films I've ever seen. The world literally looks like the color was drained from it, except for the dark red present in the Nazi flags. Maybe I need to rewatch this. But. It felt tedious this time round.",5,a-special-day

It also annoyed me how they spent around 40 minutes on earth at the beginning without much happening and then they don’t even bother to show us his travel to the space station. The cinematography looked great and is one of the best things about the movie but some of the most beautiful scenes went on for too long, for example a five minute scene of traffic. The story was good and I really liked the ending and all the philosophical questions but throughout the movie I didn’t really feel that much.

The hand drawn look (didn't look up to see if this was actually hand drawn tho)2. Bamboo cutter and local children fighting over calling Kaguya, princess or lil bamboo3. The other time those children sing and chant4. The sound design, there can be a tendency in animated films to make almost everything dialogue or music, lots of good nature sounds throughout5. The scene of Kaguya fleeing her naming party6. The willingness to show breasts and butts in ostensibly a kids' film by not sexualizing them7. Rain8. ""You can almost see the moon rising over the mountains.""9. The prince with the jeweled branches of Horai's impression of a maiden10. Kaguya's IDGAF expression when the prince's wealth burns11. Kaguya's handmaid's descriptions become smaller animated films above her head12. Cloud dragon13. A man being possessive and creepy turns Kaguya into a ghost or something14. ""The happiness you wished for me was hard to bear.""15. The bamboo cutter's wife sings ""birds, bugs, beasts"" and takes Kaguya into her arms16. Kaguya says, ""I've been found"" and looks at the sky so Sutemaru, confused, looks up too17. Flying and accompanying score18. Cloud people made me think of Super Mario RPG, one of my favorite gamesList of things I don't like about The Tale of Princess Kaguya1. Almost everything else about the animation, people's faces are flat and lacking in either nuanced or exaggerated expression, the color palette, the backgrounds2. The length, I was ~50 minutes into the movie before there was a scene that I really loved and before that the film had done little in terms of narrative or character work, mostly just established a ~feeling~3. The animators' obvious lack of interest in some aspects of animation, they animate a rose blooming with intricate lifelike detail but show the bamboo cutter and his wife walking like the same two cels simply being slid in front of a background4. I know ""magic,"" but I don't like how the film presents breast feeding considering there is already so much confusion/ignorance around everything concerning women's bodies 5. The myth of her getting older at a different rate than other people, experience is an important part of maturity, not just a person's physical qualities, yet the film plays a love story with someone who is clearly older than her, but she ""ages"" up to6. I can't help but think of 16 year old Ilya's definition of a great movie again, just things I already like but a bit slower and in a different language, the difference between this and a shitty movie like Brave is...?7. That the jeweled branch is revealed to be a fake via deus ex machina rather than via Kaguya's or someone else's knowledge or canniness (though this is not the case for the next prince)8. Out loud stating a theme, these princes see me just as another object9. Why did it take every prince roughly the same three years to come up with their plan?10. Killing off the middle counselor, especially after playing his head falling directly into a pot for laughs, forcing Kaguya to feel deep guilt when she was just protecting herself from gross suitors11. Exposition isn't woven into the script, when the audience needs to know something, a character just says it12. Creating a dramatic conflict to separate the second and third acts feels entirely forced like they didn't really know where they wanted the movie to go, so the Moon is going to steal her I guess 13. The best parts of the movie are dreams...but like, why? Magic, no?14. The way the cloud people talk, I don't know the name of the audio effect, but it is used for roughly every supernatural being in every film15.

When stripped of this, man must choose his face, whether it be bandages, makeup, or another face entirely.Truly a spectacular watch, that proved equal parts riveting, introspective, and deeply allegorical.

14307,"So this is my introduction to Andrei Tarkovsky? Oh no… Storytime! So I actually attempted to watch this film for the first time a few months ago, and when I came across the first 40-50 minutes, I just gave up on the film because I fell asleep and just didn’t feel the need to go back to this. So I made an idea to watch it with my girlfriend, and since it was the last day of my 14-day free trial of Criterion Channel, I figured to end it off on this to see if it got better or not. Turns out, it actually got worse for me. It's just not for me.I will at least understand why Tarkovsky is a famous director because the filmmaking in this is top-notch. How it was framed and filtered was done in such crisp that made it looked like an epic effectively for what it’s trying to present here. The acting is great that everybody had their moments to shine, especially the three actors since the film is relatively about them just… walking around and exploring shit I guess? I don’t really know to be honest. The score was pretty nice to listen to, and the scenery of it looked like something that was like the aftermath of nuclear warfare that the actors were making sure to not be around while also being in a dune of sand in some areas.Sounds great and everything which makes me understand why people gave it high ratings as it is very dense that has a lot of metaphorical and psychological methods here that can be analyzed, but here’s the problem though. I Just. Don’t. Fucking. Care. The pacing in this was such a fucking struggle to get through that my girlfriend was falling asleep at some points. Once we got to the 2-hour mark, I decided that we take a break from it and watch this the next day because my girlfriend thought it was boring, and I was just getting mad at the film for going through such an endurance test that I feel like it didn’t need to be that long.Even if I understood what the film was doing, the pacing just ruins it for me personally because it just feels like a slog to get through that when I asked my girlfriend how far we are into this as I thought we were like maybe an hour in, she said that we were 30 minutes in, and that’s when we both knew we aren’t going to give this a positive rating. Did I wish I ended my free trial with something else? Of course, I want that, but at least I’m glad I gave this a watch just so I can say this statement, “I watched Stalker, and I’ll say that Dorbees at least gave me an emotion. And what did this gave me? Nothing. Nothing but the need to sleep.”Criterion Channel Ranked",2,stalker
5644,"this review is probably the most controversial i've ever done, and i hesitated to post it. first of all, i want to say that this is absolutely not a criticism of all those who are fans of this movie, it's only my personal opinion, so feel free to take it into account or not.i don't think i've ever felt so confused and lost after seeing a movie and reading other people's opinions. i feel like i missed the event of the century. i tried to think more about it after my viewing, but i really can't understand the point of view of others.for me, the film was flat. i understood its intention and purpose, but i don't see how the director achieved it (and if he even did). i had a feeling of waste or unfinished thing. it was awful.when it got released i don't think there was as much talk about police brutality (i wasn't born, i’m not sure) so maybe the movie helped people talk about it more at the time, and even though the topic is still relevant, i don’t see what more it brings to the discussion today that we don’t know.i had a hard time with the characters at the beginning, but i managed to get a little bit attached to them towards the end. i don't think it's because i don't see myself in them, because usually i have no trouble feeling empathy for characters who are in situations i've never experienced. they were unloveable, and maybe that was the point, but it really pissed me off. i would have preferred a thousand times if there had been more character development.the dialogues were horrible. apart from the insults every two seconds and the few slightly poetic sentences, there was nothing.i don't know if most people on letterboxd have seen the movie in dubbed version (if it exists) or with subtitles, so maybe it wasn't the same experience, but i couldn't take it anymore at the end. it got to the point where i had to put on the subtitles (even though i’m french), because there were times when everyone was talking at the same time, or too loud, or not loud enough, and i couldn't understand anything.maybe it was because i was too tired today, that's why i'll try to watch the movie again in better conditions.the story went in circles at times, which made me lose interest in the plot and each time i found it hard to get back into it.as for the way it was filmed: i really liked the different shots and the use of black and white. it really brought something to the movie.the acting was nice but not as great as everyone says, even if there was a scene where i had chills.for me the last fifteen minutes are the best of the film, and can perhaps make it worth watching.Jusqu’ici tout va bien… L’important c’est pas la chute, c’est l’atterrissage.i would love to discuss this with others in the comments, but please be respectful! thanks for reading my review :)",2,la-haine

54252,"Very long, meandering Italian TV miniseries of two brothers who take very different paths in life. Neither the story nor the characters are very compelling. The theme of mental institution reform is great, but only plays a small role in the series.There is nothing “cinematic” about this. It’s clearly a TV production. There is no suspense and very little drama other than contrived situations. Given this is a production for television, expect a lot of tight closeups of faces as you’d see in any third rate TV drama. The entire series is done in a one-note tone that becomes tedious over such a long stretch. Decades pass, but little of interest happens.Possible threads of tension are briefly introduced, but never pursued. Such as a possible cat/mouse conflict between Matteo and Giula. The most interesting character in the film is a mentally disturbed young lady who lives in a mental institution. She makes a strong impression in the first 45 minutes and then disappears except for minor scenes. I’ve never been happier to see the words “The End” than when they appeared on the screen during this film.Minor pet peeve: when creating an historical drama where music is used to represent the times, the music must be in sync with the time period. Using Queen’s Who Wants to Live Forever in 1983 is just flat out wrong (not to mention some of the most banal telegraphing I’ve ever seen). The song wasn’t released until 1986.",1,the-best-of-youth

This slightly homoerotic critique of toxic masculinity and social malaise is effective, bonkers, exciting, and fun, with Edward Norton as the perfect straight man and Brad Pitt as the perfect violent alter ego. The cinematography, set design, writing, acting, and action is just so off-kilter and exciting, even parts where I feel the film drags a bit usually have some stand-out aspect. The film just feels so fresh and relevant even 20 years later, even if some of the humor and effects feel outdated. And that twist that Tyler Diavolo and Vinegar Doppio are the same person...just mind-blowing and I really wonder what this film would be if that fact was more of a plausible theory rather than a big reveal.On paper, a film about a weirdo who just snaps one day, becomes aggressive and gay for who he cannot be, and tells us all about it should not be something I'm going to be interested it, yet it is because the film is just so frantic and strange.

12796,"Tokyo Story did not have the emotional impact that I expected it to have. Everybody from Roger Ebert to my good friend Sally had promised me that this was going to leave me feeling devastated. Throughout its slow moving 136 minutes, I remained decidedly unmoved. There was something synthetic about the emotions displayed on screen and even though I could always tell how I was supposed to be feeling, the manipulation never quite worked. It did not feature the sort of clumsy, mawkish sentimentality that marks Hollywood productions but its cool refinement still didn’t work on me. Maybe it was something about Setsuko Hara’s oleaginous smile, or the punishing length of many of the scenes. All I know is that I would take a slickly engineered tearjerker over something that was this glacially paced. Shukishi (Chishu Ryu) and Tomi (Chieko Higashiyama) are an elderly married couple who feel lonely as they enter into the final phase of their lives. They live in a small fishing village and all of their children have moved into the big city after leaving home. They decide to travel to Tokyo in order to visit their kids and plan to spend a lot of time with them. They are startled when their children do not appear to want to spend time with them. They do not appreciate the fact that their kids have other priorities in life and do not plan to centre their entire lives around their parents. They end up in the care of Noriko (Setsuko Hara), the widow of one of their sons, and she treats them with kindness and care. As they grow more comfortable in her presence, they begin to open up about some of their issues and she becomes more accepting of the fact that she is dealing with crippling grief. They become a unit that can exist separate from the rest of the family and come to terms with the fact that they are all dealing with a profound sense of loneliness. Yasujirō Ozu’s stationary shots became an issue for me, as I wanted to see a bit more camera movement and spend far less time looking at Hara’s perky little face. With some more inventive, fast moving camerawork, some scenes would have felt less like endurance tests and more like emotionally involving, highly sentimental vignettes that brought this family’s struggles to life. There are several films about the difficulties that older married couples face as they try to make their way in the world after their children move out and begin their own lives as independent adults. Dodsworth (1936) is a personal favourite of mine and it feels perfectly paced as a result of featuring three lengthy set piece scenes that are punctuated with shorter, punchier scenes that help to build up to the next big moment. With Tokyo Story, there are very few rises or falls and it feels like you’re plunged into a state of mild, antiseptic misery that never becomes particularly fascinating. I always felt as though I was firmly distanced from this family and their issues, so that made it impossible to reach out and begin to care when one of them cried or had an epiphany. Simply put, I just didn’t have the patience for this one. I never felt as though it needed to be as long as it was and the length did not give me the opportunity to settle into this location or get to know the characters. I still respect Ozu’s filmmaking on some level and I do feel a great deal of guilt for not appreciating a piece of art that is universally beloved. I can hold onto the comforting thought that this is just one of those films that I do not yet understand. Maybe a few years down the line, something will click for me and this will have me bawling my eyes out. I worry that this moment will never come and I will be stuck in La Grande Illusion (1937) territory forever. Everybody has a couple of classics that just don’t resonate with them and cinephiles talk about them with pain and self hatred in their voices. It can be hard to admit that you just don’t get it.",4,tokyo-story
23160,"Very heavy-handed propaganda film that glorifies Communism, the Cuban Revolution, and Fidel Castro and vilifies capitalism (often personified by loutish Americans) and the Batista dictatorship that preceded Castro’s reign. Unfortunately, this movie is so focused on being successful propaganda that it fails to develop any characters or an interesting story. Instead, it consists of four vignettes that ham-fistedly try to embody the struggles of the Cuban people. The first two stories depict the subjugation and degradation of individual Cubans by capitalist pigs, and the second two stories depict young pro-Castro revolutionaries fighting back against the machine. But all of the characters seem more like symbols than people, and the events that happen are extremely obvious allegories that hold little interest as stories. There’s also a derivative scene pulled directly from Spartacus (released four years before this movie) in which a row of young revolutionaries tell the police, “I Am Fidel,” “I Am Fidel.” Eyeroll.The portrayal of the Cuban characters is also very problematic. For the most part, the stand-ins for Cuba are either young women (often intoning in voiceover, “I Am Cuba”) who are sexually degraded by Americans or farmers who seem unable to fully grasp what is going on around them. It’s all extremely patronizing, especially because this movie was principally a Soviet Union production, and only secondarily a co-production by Castro’s Cuban government. Anyway, I’m baffled by the fact that this movie currently has a 4.4 rating on Letterboxd. Maybe because of the genuinely beautiful cinematography?",0,i-am-cuba
14583,"Cw: suicide.English subtitles, Japanese audio.MiddlingI'm not sold on the 'artist turning his life into art' angle. It could have been done, and had it been done to my satisfaction I probably would have used the same frame story technique, but it's the focus that's putting me off. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful, but it's beautiful at the wrong times. A glorification of its own subject without properly condemning his actions as an ultranationalist. I get what was trying to be said, Mishima was a complicated man, I don't deny that, but are we really going to pretend that his glorified ritual suicide was anything other than a tragic accident of a broken man? Suicide is a serious topic and it's not an expression of ritualistic Romanticism; that's unfortunately not the feeling I got from Ken Ogata's performance. The film seems to be building up to this moment, a masturbatory exercise in one's own power as an auteur, after all, writing changes the world. What interests me a lot more—and isn't contained within the text as much as I would perhaps hope—is his internalisation of his queer experience and perhaps more generally his mental state as well. Providing psychoanalytic readings is shakey ground scientifically and not wholly interesting to me anyway but I could see a case for this film as each self-contained story expresses a particular emotion ending in a sense of tragedy, this shows the psychology of a man unsure of his own expressions yet rigid in his commitment to them. Burning down the Kinkaku-ji, having your life ended as a consequence of a financially beneficial S/M relationship, seppuku performed at the sight of a rising sun. It all demonstrates a passion for destruction, but each from different perspectives: the external, the unaccepted internal and the accepted internal. To me it seems like as we progress through Mishima's life, we see his refocus of passion perform in tandem with his mental state. It is just a shame then that the film spends so much time dedicated not to this specifically, but to how it can then transform it into the culmination of his artistic project or—even worse—Schrader's.",3,mishima-a-life-in-four-chapters
72549,"Actor Challenge - movie 32 - Rebecca Hall“Obsession is a young mans game.”I’d somehow managed to not have anything in this movie spoiled for me. An inventive and original idea, executed with style, everything I’d expect from Nolan. A high concept but made better by grounded by well written and developed lead characters. It’s full of surprises and twists that I didn’t see coming, and I’m sure a rewatch would help cement the cleverness of how it’s all pulled together. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fantastic here, magicians in the 19th century, both desperate to show their clever ideas and concepts to the world. Jackman especially surprised me here, slowly changing from the charming and outgoing character to being more manipulative and scheming as the movie progresses. Michael Caine gives a soft but great performance as a sort of mentor and guide to the characters in this magicians world. With a lovely smaller role for Bowie, always so mysterious and other worldly.  What really worked for me was the rivalry between them, just how far their obsessions take them to out do each other. It’s like a game of chess being played between them, always trying to be one step in front of the other, even if it means taking desperate and rather terrible measures to ensure their success. This is where the tension comes into play. The plot is structured in a perfect way, told through different timelines, so you never truly expect what is about to come, there’s a sort of anticipation of waiting for moments you know will come into play later in the movie. It looks great, the costumes and old fashioned world created for these characters is designed and shot so well by Nolan. There’s so many smaller details to this world for the characters to live. The inventions and magic tricks having some great designs, almost alien but also looking very of their time and fitting in perfectly. Nolan manages to craft a clever plot together, that seemingly pieces together perfectly. I can’t wait to go back to see how the twists and turns play out when you know what to expect, I’m sure there’s clever signposts and moments that slowly drop in what is to come. Previous Actor - The Town - Rebecca HallNext Actor - American Hustle - Christian Bale",8,the-prestige

1236,"Never a fan of samurai movies and don't understand people's fascination with them, yet I was coerced into seeing Seven Samurai because of the unanimous praise on the Internet. Admittedly the score and cinematography are top-notch even for a layman like me, and the character played by Toshirō Mifune is so likeable it's probably what I like the most about Seven Samurai. I mean who doesn't want to see a goofy, macho Toshirō running about bare-butt? Despite the aforementioned merits, there are problems that prevent me from fully enjoying this movie and lauding it as a classic like everybody else. First It is LONG, like super long, with a lot of buildup for a final showdown. I mean the story is sort of interesting, but not interesting enough to warrant an over 200 minute runtime. I don't really care about the character building either, as I find most of the samurai characters forgettable saves for my man Toshirō. Finally, as a samurai movie, it doesn't build up a sense of danger or ominousness until the very end when we get to the nitty gritty. So the sympathy votes for the characters are never in place until the showdown, which I think really hurts the movie's power of emotional resonance.All in all Seven Samurai is a decent samurai movie with high technical achievements. It may not be as impeccable as its reviews suggest, but it's still worth a watch, though its runtime can be a hard pill to swallow.",5,seven-samurai

In truth, The Great Dictator sees him doing a considerable number of things right. The movie appeared when the United States was still officially at peace with Nazi Germany, with Chaplin depicting Hitler, here named Adenoid Hynkel, as an egotistical sociopath with misconceptions of grandeur.It features the outstanding Paulette Goddard, who was Chaplin's spouse at the time, as the champion of the Jewish ghetto along with a capable cast portraying a company of dominating and obnoxious aggressors all satirised by harsh-sounding German phonetics and by spoofing the tempo of the Italian language.

I think it has gained cult status for a reason, and we have to take into account that this is a film from 1974, and yet it is extremely high quality in all aspects of the film.It bothered me quite a bit, that the film is quite slow-paced, and that some scenes seem to have been inserted for no reason, in order to make the film last longer and look nicer. I think he needed that speed so that I would be a lot more tense, and the very premise and twists would be more surprising, but even this way he was very good, you can definitely feel the quality.The actors really did an outstanding job, and gave their mysterious characters a very tense and intense relationship between themselves. Jack Nicholson, as a very brave, dedicated and cold detective. Faye Dunaway, as a beautiful woman full of secrets, mystery and intrigue. The two are a perfect tandem, and their different empathies, which they feel for each other, make them so special in their relationship.I have the impression that this film leaves an even better impression on the second viewing, but I will find out soon. Even though the movie doesn't leave you overly enthusiastic, it still has something that makes you love it and it just seems great to you, which it certainly is. I guess it's because of that overall atmosphere and quality, which is felt.All in all, this is a rather complex film, which needs to be understood in the right way, because not everything is as shown and as it seems.

81078,"A 3 hour story of three drastically different veterans coming out of World War two.  Like many of these mid-century post-war films this one likely communicates a completely different message to folks than it did in 1946.  This one mirrors what veterans have gone through in years since and actually feels like it could very well take place today with vets coming back from the Middle-East.  Common themes include veteran PTSD, depression and dismemberment, and these are all still major issues with individuals who have served in the armed forces today.  Seeing that these were major issues in a film dating to the end of World War II adds a bit of intrigue to the events portrayed in the film.  Personally I enjoyed act one the most.  The segments with the humongous post-war airplane scrapyard was likely my favorite parts as this films turns into a full-blown dramance in the later acts.  It's a good flick for it's age, no doubt, but this is another best picture that just falls pretty far from my genre of choice making my opinion of it really leave something to be desired.1946 Ranked1940's RankedRomance films RankedMilitary / War films RankedSubstance / Stoner / Alcoholic / Psychedelic usage films Ranked",2,the-best-years-of-our-lives
11163,"Denis Villeneuve has insisted that “Dune: Part Two” would be a direct continuation of its predecessor rather than a sequel, and the man has absolutely made good on that promise: Not only does this new movie pick up exactly where the last one left off, it also carries over the strengths and weaknesses that made the previous chapter so astonishing to look at but stultifying to watch. Once again, Frank Herbert’s sand-blasted spice opera has been adapted at a scale that makes the average Hollywood blockbuster seem like a shoebox diorama by comparison, and while the last “Dune” was compromised by Warner Bros. brass’ decision to sacrifice it at the altar of a streaming platform that no longer exists, “Part Two” is poised to thunder into multiplexes around the world like the Shai-Hulud swimming through a dry ocean full of desert mice.Once again, the biblical solemnity of Villeneuve’s approach — along with the tactile brutalism of his design — have combined into a Timothée Chalamet movie that shimmers with the patina of an epic myth. And once again, the awesome spectacle that Villeneuve mines from all that scenery is betrayed by the smallness of the human drama he stages against it, with the majesty of the movie’s first hour desiccating into the stuff of pure tedium as Paul Atreides struggles to find his voice amid the visions that compel him forward. It’s a struggle that “Dune: Part Two” continues to embody all too well. This isn’t quite the same common — and admittedly boring — criticism that’s been leveled against massive studio movies since the industry first started making them. This isn’t a case of sound and fury signifying nothing, or one of special effects signifying even less. The artistry of this film’s craftsmanship and the sincerity of its application would in and of themselves make it disingenuous to compare “Dune: Part Two” to the likes of, say, “Jurassic World” and Disney’s “live-action” remake of “The Lion King.” But there’s a more important distinction at play: Where those creatively bankrupt examples — motivated by desperate market forces — suffered from the mistaken belief that the future is a foregone conclusion no matter how awful it looks, “Dune” is an auteur-driven story about a reluctant messiah who’s tortured by his role in a terrible prophecy that only he has the power to stop. And yet, we’re never given any reason to think that Paul might actually do it, or even to care if he can. If “Dune: Part Two” is more nuanced and action-packed than the previous installment, and Chalamet’s twiggy princeling a far less passive hero than he was the first time around, the relative density of the drama that Villenueve has packed into this movie is deflated by a similar uptick in the grandiosity of the spectacle that surrounds it. Much like his protagonist, the filmmaker is straining to reconcile a larger-than-life sense of predestination with the intimate pain of a moral dilemma, but his own failure to achieve that balance makes it all but impossible for Paul to succeed on the same terms. The droning heaviness of Villeneueve’s direction is great at creating a sustained mood (in this case, one of mournfully pyrrhic victory), but it flattens characters into the sets around them until they start to feel like part of the scenery themselves. It’s as difficult to trace the granular changes in Paul’s thinking as it would be to notice a single chip in the giant slabs of gray concrete that form the gladiator arena on Giedi Prime (Chalamet’s gradual transition from reverent whisper-talking to empyrean scream-shouting is the closest thing we get to legible character growth), and that lack of detail becomes a fittingly enormous problem for this film as the transportive stage-setting of its first half gives way to the stunted fatalism of its second. Yes, this is a vaguely Oedipal tragedy about a manchild lurching towards the same violent outcome that he’s so determined to avoid (you’ll have to wait for the not-yet-announced but inevitable “Part Three” to see how that plays out), and of course there’s an ancient power in the story of someone fighting against the fate that’s been written for them. But the iron grip of that inevitability should only make it more heart-wrenching to follow Paul as he tries to find his role among the Fremen of Arrakis and avenge his father without instigating an intergalactic holy war. Instead, Paul’s growing prescience becomes a major albatross for a film too focused on the big picture to look for signs of life in each scene along the way, and watching this boy-god arrive at the only possible future among the many that he learns to foresee is as dull and emotionally disengaging as it was to watch him awake to that destiny in the first “Dune.” “Part Two” may be the more broadly entertaining of these two movies, but feeling unmoved by the climactic sight of Willy Wonka riding a 400-meter sandworm into battle against a Manhattan-sized disco ball is also a much weirder and more uncomfortable kind of disappointment than anything the last chapter had to offer. ~this review continues on IndieWire~",4,dune-part-two

30230,"It's truly satisfying in a sick way for me to see Red Beard, one of the most lauded ""classics"" in history, getting a low 70s on Rotten Potatoes. Despite the fact that I'm by no means a Kurosawa fan, and that the only work I truly enjoy from him is High and Low, It's still disheartening that every time I've decided to give Kurosawa one more chance, it's yet another disappointment with another entry of his filmography. However, when it comes to Red Beard, it's simply one of the biggest insomnia-killers and one of the most excruciatingly joyless experiences I've had with motion pictures.Red Beard admittedly has great potentials on paper: a slow-burn story about two doctors bonding over saving lives in ancient Japan, and the marvelous casting of Toshiro Mifune and Yūzō Kayama, two of the hottest working Japanese actors of its time, is truly a blessing for the eyes. However, great acting could only get you this far, especially for a freaky monolith with over 3 hours of mind-numbing banality that's as didactic and generic as one could imagine, made worse by its uninteresting supporting characters filling up the runtime by oversharing their sleep-inducing life stories. Although I wasn't head over heels for the likes of Seven Samurai or Rashomon, I could totally appreciate the efforts put into creating such unique stories for a better viewing experience. For Red Beard, however, it's simply a painfully lazy effort to stretch a thin storyline into an aimless giant that never amounts to anything substantial all things considered.

85556,"2021’s 105th movie • 12/100Hypocrisy is one of the things I hate the most in the world, and it’s disappointing for me to say that this movie is full of it. It feels like it was entirely written by a conservative who made it to indirectly say things like “not all pedophiles really are pedophiles” and that guns can do good for people in general. The same way a lot of people love to say that Green Book is ridiculous because it leaves a message that “not all racists really are racists”, the same thing happens here involving another controversial subject. Both cases are different, Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is a victim. But this is not exactly what made me dislike this movie so much.The Hunt, just like the title says, talks about a hunter and this is another point that I’d like to talk about. The fact that Thomas Vinterberg wants the audience to feel sorry for a hunter is at least funny and extremely hypocritical. There’s no difference between killing a dog or a deer. This could have been a less embarrassing situation if, after the main character’s dog’s killing, he would feel sorry for the other animals he kills. It’s ridiculous to justify this by saying “it’s a tradition” when slavery was a tradition in the whole world for centuries and is now prohibited everywhere, for example. What truly bothers me is the fact that this movie portrays men with guns in their hands as a good thing, whether it is to kill animals or not – it’s disgusting. No, Thomas. Guns are the worst things still being used by human beings and they have only brought pain, suffering and violence to the world.It’s really rare for me to get so frustrated about a movie, but I may have seen it from a different perspective than most people. There is absolutely nothing rational about it at all. I understand and appreciate how the story makes us look at a certain situation from different sides. However, the movie deceives itself. The emotional and involving story distracts people's attention from another very important issue that must be discussed about this movie. It could have been better. It was disappointing.

51233,"""ALARM!!!!""My biggest concern with going into war movies that are hailed as classics, is that they'll just be too boring and clichéd for me to really attach myself to anything. With Das Boot, there are somewhat clichéd moments, but boring? No, not for a single fucking minute.The director clearly knew how to use his budget for this. The claustrophobia of this sub is real. I actually had trouble sleeping last night because of it. You can smell the iron and saltwater coming off the screen so vividly. This film really knocks tone and atmosphere, right out of the park. This movie is just purely bleak. There’s so much hopelessness and dread that it actually reminded me of Come and See at points.This film has an incredible sense of personality, showcasing some very impressive cinematography. There are quite a ton of great long takes with tons of action and movement taking place within the incredibly tight confines of the sub, making the action scenes even more intense.The acting is also great. All the performances work and not a single one stands out as underwhelming. The writing makes you care for them, even if it does pull a few classic clichés from up its sleeve. The music was fantastic. There are points where it's a little overused, but this film mostly nails it when it comes to orchestration. The tracks during the actions scenes really help sell the intensity. I also love a particular scene that contains no music and barely any dialogue, and it's just so fucking intense, all because of its use of the sonar ping sound. The chills were real.There is a 20-minute section before the final 40 minutes where I was a little less engaged. The writing as a whole does contain some clichéd moments. I already mentioned the minor overuse of music at points. This film was genuinely a suspensful and incredibly intense thrill ride from start to finish. I would easily recommend it as an essential viewing for war film buffs, and lovers of good film in general. What a fucking marvel of stress and anxiety!",8,das-boot

The films are The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976), Don't Look Now (1973), Eureka (1983) and Insignificance (1985).Samples of Roeg's film Performance (1970) can be heard in the song and his film Walkabout (1971) is also referenced.Here is the video:Big Audio Dynamite - E=mc2 (1986)www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHTDkJ-bQqM",5,eureka

39730,"Wow, this thing really didn't work for me.Setting aside the meditation on death which did not resonate as particularly profound or insightful (as it has for many others, so fine), my central problem with the film was its dire lack of spontaneity. Every encounter, every bit of dialogue feels as aggressively choreographed as a Fosse dance number (Exhibit A: the performance his girlfriend and daughter put on for Gideon in his apartment. Every laugh comes off as rehearsed to within an inch of its life. I kept thinking about Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien's duet in Meet Me in St. Louis, with its effortless grace and charm.) And with the exception of Scheider (believable, if too soft), the rest of the cast played more as caricature than character. Even John Lithgow is bad! Wait. Is it supposed to be a meta-thing? Life is a stage and all the people in Gideon's life merely players? If so, then I just wasn't on the movie's wavelength.The other problem is Scheider, or more specifically Fosse's writing and direction of his stand-in. Scheider is a very capable and charismatic actor, but he isn't believably cruel enough - or sexy enough - for me to believe him as a dervish creator who goes through women like kleenex. Fosse let's himself off easy with his daughter. In fact lets himself off easy with everyone. Like a guy who pretends to be flogging himself, when all he's really doing is producing his own wake.

62247,"In the words of a popular copypasta:To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand ""Jeanne Dielman 23, Quai du Commerce 1080 Bruxelles"". The plot is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical matter of film studies and gender theory, most of the themes and stylistic treatments will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Jeanne's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterization - her personal philosophy draws heavily from Second Wave Feminism literature, for instance. The true cinephiles understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the scenography, to realize that it's not just boring - it says something deep about WOMAN'S LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike ""Jeanne Dielman..."" truly ARE idiot s- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the drama in her sons existential statement ""I don't want daddy to thrust in you"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Freud's theory of Oedipus complex. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Chantal Akerman's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a tattoo of Jeanne Dielman's address. And no, you cannot see it.

What the fuck is up with the scene where Asuka is shifting around in her bed? Why the fuck did they frame Sakura's ass up close during an emotional scene? “Ahhh but you see, Supreme, Evangelion is a masterpiece that criticizes otakus and weebs for sexualizing anime girls.

24499,"This entire review is going to be a hot take. Please bear with me. This film is by all means beautiful. I had very high expectations coming into it. I watched it today, and to be honest I feel a bit disappointed and empty. I felt like it dragged on for the last hour and it would never end. San is an extremely underused and undeveloped character that I would have liked to see more of. But maybe keeping her mysterious was the point of the story? My favorite character of the film was probably Yakul (the yak). He is loyal and I didn’t to his master from start to finish. I also thought they would go into exploring the curse more. The viewer is mostly in the dark when it comes to the curse. What kept me hooked during the entire film was wanting to know what was going to happen with the two main characters and the curse. The climax of the film was very underwhelming to me, I felt like it could have been done better.Joe Hisaishi impressed me with the main theme of the movie within the first 5 minutes. I was excited but we rarely hear that theme come up again. Which leads me to say that the score was very underused. With all that being said, I still enjoyed it to a certain extent. But it left me unsatisfied and wanting more music. It’s Overall a beautiful Studio Ghibli film, but for me it is overrated.

""The right hand's coming back.""I've been meaning to check this out ever since I watched La Haine and finally, I did the right thing today! One hell of a slice-of-life film that wanted its story beats to be not at all slice-of-life in the years to follow it, but sadly the genre name still holds up today with what a 32-year-old Spike Lee delivered 31 years ago. Spike Lee raises the temperature right away and shows how the blacks get to absorb all the heat typical of their colour. Sliced his characters brilliantly by showing the good and bad in each piece, be it black or white (didn't use white people as mere scapegoats to make his point, for instance, depicted their good side as well, be it, Sal counselling his hatemonger Son Pino, although on the basis of them growing up over the years and living on his food that helped the business or Vito's friendship with Mookie) and the way he assembled them perfectly to serve a platter with everything that matters, serves as a masterclass in character building, simmering tension building and above all, the theme building when the place collapses after witnessing the collapse of humanity.  I was wondering all the while when will I get to see Smiley smiling and by the time I got to see him smiling looking at the photograph of Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X smiling together, I was already in tears!

67916,"SPOILER FOR WAGES OF FEAR, TOOWhile I haven't read the book, I was hoping that Sorcerer wouldn't do the same thing that Wages of Fear did at the end. Thankfully this film has a much better ending that I can believe. A run-yourself-off-the-road-accidentally ending makes sense in an Il Sorpasso, for instance, where it's established that there is a certain recklessness or influence thereof. If it were me and I miraculously finished the job, I wouldn't be all that excited. I'd be in a state of shock. So, yes, this film is more believable, but I actually did rate Wages of Fear higher, as the tension and obstacles in that film worked better for me. That's not to say the set pieces in Sorcerer aren't tense. The bridge sequence is absolutely phenomenal. Truly some of the most effective action. It was a heart pounding experience, but more than anything, I was just in awe. Loved the cinematography in this, too. The obstacle involving the bandits, though, didn't sit well with me, as it seemed like a basic plot point/throwaway idea compared to everything else.",7,sorcerer

How fucking dare you make a film that infantilizes the holocaust to this degree and in this way. How fucking dare you use it as a setting for your goofy antics. That’s the thing that bugs me the most, I think, that this felt like it could’ve taken place against the backdrop of any difficult situation, so long as Benigni gets to clown around in the same way. The point was in the difficulty itself, not the nature of it. And of course all the fucking tropes are here. The good nazi. Why does there always have to be a good fucking nazi? Why? Why is this the point that most holocaust films feel they have to make? What’s so important about the concept of “not-all-nazis” that makes it this pervasive. Benigni’s discount Chaplin-ing is only mildly grating until they get to the camp, at which point it becomes enraging. The engagement with the true evil of the nazis and the concentration camp feels surface level as well. The gassing of children is tossed off as fodder for a bit without any consideration for the humanistic implications of that. The deaths of significant characters are dealt with in a similar way. This film has no interest in dealing with the holocaust at any level beyond using it to show Roberto Benigni’s supposed creative prowess. Functionally “The Simpsons are going to Dachau”.

I’m not sure how incredibly true it is, but I found that idea really fascinating so I tried an experiment and took a risk I wouldn't normally take. I watched the 2nd one first.Not knowing what happened in the first film with their last encounter adds a layer of mystery and makes for such a more interesting story, and watching the first film as an almost prequel to this tomorrow will make this film even more heartbreaking yet it is heartwarming and bittersweet i’m sure. Piecing together the previous story and who these characters are and what the history is made for a genuinely more interesting story to me, rather than just seeing “what happens next” in a way, it left more ambiguity.This is such a beautiful film even as it stands alone, yet it’s not even remotely exiting or dramatic in any way, it’s just a film about how the phrase “right person, wrong time” can also be taken in a way that there is never a wrong time for the right person.

Sherlock, Jr. says that the answer is all of the above.People dream to process their emotions. Buster Keaton plays a film projectionist who wants to be a detective. The only problem? He doesn't think he can be both nor do justice to both, like the old proverb that starts the film. But, to dream is to have a safe place to deal with those anxieties. There is no need to worry about not having enough money or simply being an awkward person. Here, he even has the ability to lucid dream (an ability I wish I had) and in the process, he is in control of where he can go. People dream to sort and consolidate memories. The sheer amount of information and memories that a person collects every day is frightening to think about. Sherlock, Jr. is told as a film inside of a film that is actually a dream that reflects past memories (what a mouthful!) to help make sense of this all. Important memories stay, while useless memories fade away. Of the memories that stay, those shape how he wants to act after he wakes up. Why waste energy remembering what is useless? People dream to prepare and protect themselves for a bracing reality. After all, if Buster Keaton can perform stunts that manage to be so perfectly timed every single time, then the real world can't be so bad. The prevailing sense of optimism never leaves really. Sherlock, Jr. is pure wonder, transversing the bounds of film to enter into a world of dreams, but always remembering to be grounded in reality.

44545,"This is Andrei Tarkovsky’s last film. It would be nothing less than stupid to say he wasn’t one of the most revolutionary, precise, freeing and most likely the best director to ever walk the face of planet earth, and it would be far more stupid to say he hasn’t changed how I personally view cinema and how I plan to make films of my own one day. His films were truly like no other, he constantly has me in a trance, a weird state in between consciousness and unconsciousness that I am simultaneously terrified by and addicted to. While watching a film directed by Andrei Tarkovsky I am not thinking about anything, I barely think about what’s going on. I try, but it is futile to resist the power these films have over me, I am not thinking about anything while simultaneously thinking about everything.This film in particular, his final film is a very interesting film. It follows a man Alexander on his birthday as he learns of a nuclear war going on. It focuses on many themes, but the one I primarily want to talk about is dread. Now I think most people reading this suffer from dread, a majority of the population was born after the first nuclear weapon was used and they’ve only gotten bigger since then. The thought that one day our benevolent leaders or “dictators” could get bored and end life as we know it, is terrifying. The thought of losing everything we made, achieved, our families, friends, pets, everything gone. The reason dread I think is primarily so good in this film is due to the fact that while making it Tarkovsky was aware he was dying from cancer and that this would be his final film. It’s weird to call this Andrei Tarkovsky’s magnum opus when easily all of his films could bear that title, but it’s true, it’s a personal film about Tarkovsky coming to terms with his eventual and incoming death, something that we all will come to terms with one day.",9,the-sacrifice

It's a high concept, dreamlike film with a gorgeous score, breathtaking animation, and an excellent voice cast, and it impressively manages a smooth transition between two very different halves. For the most part, the melodrama of the final act feels completely earned, and the film's undying appreciation for love and memories--even across space and time--helps keep it grounded. And yet, there's a transcendent quality to certain scenes that gives the story its emotional heft. Late in the film, there's a stunning conversation between our two characters that is so raw, so honest, so heartfelt, that it singlehandedly makes the entire thing worth experiencing. Then, just like that, it ends, but you're still holding on to something. Maybe a moment, maybe a person, maybe just a name.",6,your-name
34615,"That ending didn’t move me, it left me feeling mad. It was nonsensical and silly, and yet it was played completely straight. We are meant to be moved by the sight of a woman being brought back to life because of the power of prayer. The woman who has been resurrected is a perfect Christian wife. She walks around grinning at everybody, is selfless in every situation and doesn’t appear to have a temper. In essence, she has no recognisably human traits. None of the other characters in Ordet feel like human beings either. Carl Theodor Dreyer invents snivelingly arrogant doctors who randomly take the opportunity to yell at God after saving a woman’s life, several weak men who go through a crisis of faith and a ‘crazy man’ who turns out to be extra godly. I felt like I was watching a Danish arthouse version of a Pureflix film. Ordet allows viewers to indulge their persecution conceiving of ridiculous scenarios in which weak people make straw man arguments against the idea of God existing. These scenes are terribly unconvincing and they stop this film from being thought provoking. It feels like Dreyer has already determined exactly how you are meant to feel, and proceeds to force this idea on you for 126 minutes. It’s unpleasant stuff. It’s only virtue is that it beautifully captures the landscape of rural Denmark. It presents a cold, harsh environment in which people are only just getting by. Survival is the point for these people. They don’t have time to furnish their houses with all sorts of knick knacks, or to place giant Jeff Koons sculptures in their backyard. Their lives are presented as fairly miserable and Dreyer avoids romanticising their situation, although we get far too many gauzy close-ups of Inger. I was pleased by the fact that the characters aren’t shot in a way that allows us to pity them or look down on them. The film is shot in a way that forces us to confront their socio-economic status head-on. It’s an unflinching look at a difficult situation and I wish that the script had given the characters more breathing room. When it felt like Kevin Sorbo could have appeared without seeming out of place, I knew that things were not going well.",3,ordet
16361,"What an outstanding film. It has evoked so many emotions in me that I haven’t felt in a while. Set in Russia, during the war the film highlights the rustic and galvanized of a gradually forsaken land, in stunning black and white. The cinematography captures such imposing shots that makes anyone marvel at its sight, going as far as using unconventional tricks for its scenes. We have seen alot films with this storyline, but this one is especially sincere. I didn’t connect with the characters, Veronika and Boris, as a couple. I believe it’s mostly attributed to me needing a supple amount of a background storyline for it to work, but nevertheless the actors did a great job. Veronika stole the show though, given the relatively small runtime, the director honed her as a three-dimensional character and it worked. You can see and feel in her, the very epitome of loss. I was not a fan of the timeskips after each catastrophe, I felt like it was contradictory to what the film wanted to express, but I respect the artistic choice since it may be past the runtime. The ending pulled my heartstrings quite a bit. It was such a sad, and hopeful sight. It has been a long time since I cried on a film, this one just made my tears well up because I never felt so seen by its depiction of loss. A very personal thing to me, and I didn’t know a film would translate it for me.

However reading the wiki it was remade with Jason Statham playing Nick. I am for some reason very curious about that movie now.That is the shitty part about it is this movie could have actually been good, there were parts that had good bits. Burt was great, cast was really into it but the story was corny as hell and the action scenes were piss poor. I watched Sharky's Machine a few months ago, it makes me wonder what could have been if Burt directed this himself or if Robert Altman (the originals director). This could have been one hell of a revenge noir movie. Instead it feels like a made for TV movie done poorly even by 80s standards.

(Sometimes the split is horizontal, not vertical, pulling the horizon into sharp focus while leaving the foreground disturbingly murky and undefined.) The camera movements have a perverse edge to them, either pulling back from motion toward it as if recoiling or pursuing from behind in a manner redolent of Raimi-Cam played at normal speed, a stalking, invisible predator hunting down harried villagers. The stylization never really tips over into escapist fantasy though, and when it does, Klimov filters it through negating documentary footage, the only real fantasy for a victim of the horrific brutality on-screen found in the wishful thinking of being able to turn back time. Even then, he cannot consummate his fevered desire when it demands he become like those who have destoryed him.",8,come-and-see
29444,"So, I watched Where is the Friend's House? this morning and wow, it's an incredibly interesting and meaningful film. I was truly impressed by the simple yet gripping story it tells. Now, the ending might stir up some controversy, but that's what makes it all the more intriguing!One thing that really stood out to me was the strong message of caring for our friends throughout the film. When Ahmed sets out on a mission to find his buddy and return his notebook, his genuine understanding of just how important that notebook is to Mohamed and the potential trouble Mohamed could get into without it shines through. it shows us just how important friendship and looking out for each other really are. I mean, Ahmed's determination to help his friend, even when it seemed like a small task, was truly inspiring.Can we take a moment to appreciate Abbas Kiarostami's unique storytelling style? The gorgeous rural setting and stunning cinematography create such an authentic and visually appealing atmosphere. Trust me, I got completely lost in the beauty of it all.Sure, there were a few moments where I wondered about the characters' choices, but I actually liked that the film leaves room for different interpretations. It gets you thinking and sparks some great discussions about the themes it explores.Overall, I highly recommend watching Where is the Friend's House? It's a film that's definitely worth your time. If you enjoy heartfelt stories that make you ponder life's little moments, then this one's for you. I genuinely enjoyed the whole experience, and I'm pretty sure you will too.July 2023 Ranked • abbas Kiarostami ⊷➢ Ranked",8,where-is-the-friends-house
24283,"Somber, gut-wrenchingly real and impeccably acted. The Pianist tells the incredible story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish man who survived the holocaust and the nazi regime with the help of some good samaritans, some good luck and perseverance.By using his own memories and experiences, Polanski manages to make a realistic, impactful and objective look at this man's incredible, heartbreaking, powerful, tragic yet ultimately uplifting journey. Polanski never once caves into easy sentiment or cheap hectoring to fully portray the horror and hopelessness of the time. It is truly fascinating. Adrien Brody gives his all. His work is extraordinary. He's committed, harrowing and indispensable. A performance for the ages. At the end, I found myself crying. All of this actually happened. Unimaginable horrors. Nazis gassed women and children and stuffed pillows with their hair. Buckets of severed heads. Experiments done to babies. Humans turned into soap. Mountains of bodies in mass graves. The Holocaust remains as the most disgusting, infuriating, embarrassing, diabolical event in human history.

28707,"Christopher Nolan switches out his bad dude cynicism for cry-per-half-hour sentimentalism and tough guy utopian science in which we are our future gods. For all of his capacities as Hollywood's leading blockbuster auteur Nolan can't help but turn what reads like a straightforward story on paper into a filmic mess of bizarro mood shifts and environmental indifference (most obvious in his nonsensically edited action sequences and ruthless location shifts). On a formal level Interstellar falls apart when the director attempts parallel storytelling (I could care less about 'plotholes') and this new thread highlights his inability to build a character beyond made-for-trailer one-liners as well as his penchant for reducing them to fuck-all if and when it suits, e.g. Casey Affleck becoming 'farmer asshole' and Jessica Chastain becoming 'lady in love with Topher Grace' all of a sudden. The film's emotions are juggled awkwardly because nobody can predict how much they will weigh: early on they're used to trick us into caring about what's to come, later they're background noise, later still they're instrumental in detangling something about a black hole and a bookshelf, and after that they're weirdly subverted in a scene that didn't need to be there any way. Issues such as these, Matt Damon's late-inserted villain, and the film's run-time are all symptoms of the same problem- Nolan has been given what no artist should ever be given if he/she wants to improve at their craft, and that is everything- the rare and lethal combination of critical praise, fanboyism, and box office success.",0,interstellar
79083,"I have NEVER intermittently cried that long during a movie. This movie telegraphs where it's going from the beginning. I mean, look at the poster. There are no delusions of sudden windfalls of cash or changes of heart. For me, that feeling of inertia is what gives this story life. Unlike Tokyo Story, which was clearly inspired by this, the future of the elderly protagonists are completely at the whims of their children. In a vacuum, their children's' decisions could seem callous. But, similar to Tokyo Story, McCarey makes their actions feel not melodramatic but normal, because in reality they are normal. That lack of judgment, and instead acknowledgement of inevitability, is really special and poignant. And yeah the last 30 minutes ruined me. The faded memories, admission of shortcomings, and seeing these people happy together, it was so beautiful.

13429,"God moves in mysterious ways.Something that I much more appreciated than really got into, yet this is absolutely a film worth watching at least once. From a visual perspective, I become most interested with how The Passion of Joan of Arc uses mostly close-ups of the character's faces in nearly every shot, and the accentuate the power of these shots even more, no one in this movie wears any makeup. Seeing the flaws and imperfections in the faces of everyone here helps hammer home the film's concepts that much more. On that note, it's a helluva story to watch unfold, something being done in the name of God when you're more than anything nearly beating the faith out of someone. For being someone that thinks Joan of Arc is a very cool historical figure, I had not known very much about her demise prior to watching this film. I would have to look into it more from here, but based on this movie alone, it's fascinating for me to think about how some of the most interesting people in world history face the most grisly and tragic of deaths. The acting from Maria Falconetti is incredible, sporting eyes you won't soon forget after watching this. The silent nature of the feature also adds more than it takes away, and the score that accompanies nearly every moment is completely angelic. Might receive a higher rating upon another visit.

673,"It is horrible, what happened.I don't want the easy release of thinking that there are strictly good and evil people - I want to know how all-in-all normal people, not monsters, commit monstrously heinous crimes. The alternatives, of just having throat-stomping scenes one after another, feels to me like an evening at the feelies. Afterward, all I'm left with is the same rage and hatred that fueled the acts, but pointed at a different target.I want a movie that holds us, as human beings, accountable. It feels dishonest to be left off the hook, to be left saying ""Nazis were terrible. I'm not a Nazi."" What is that situation that created this capability in them - could it be created in me? Because it feels like a large part of what makes that change is the same anger and rage I feel toward the unadulterated evil men in this movie. It feels like movies like this contribute to that sort of dehumanization.But, maybe I'm wrong. I've struggled with this, and I struggled after 12 Years A Slave as well - maybe this is just my privileged view of always having movies be for me, or people like me, to explore ourselves. This movie may not be about what's going on in the oppressor, but strictly about forcing people to see the oppressed. Maybe there is a value in people who have been through trauma being able to simply show that on film. Maybe the fact that it is hard for me to watch is just me trying to look away from the trauma and the cruelty and the oppression.Maybe the value comes in simply saying ""This happened. It was unthinkable, and impossibly cruel, and yet, it was done to us."" Having the thing that happened seen and recognized, without muddying it with any possible rationalization or complicated antiheroes, maybe there's something healing in simply saying ""This was done to us."" Maybe there is a value in seeing and feeling that unmitigated rage and uncomplicated violence that these people have felt, to understand that they really could not and do not care who the oppressor was or what makes them that way. To ask an oppressed person to also understand the things that make up their oppressor probably deserves a big ""Fuck you.""In the recent debate over HBO's planned alternate history of the confederacy, they seemed blind-sided that people would not want that show. I'm sure the intent was to do just what I'm asking - to look into how humane committed inhumane acts, to put it in today's world in order to grapple with it more openly. But, it's possible to be so wrapped up in a world that never was threatened by evil, that you become deaf to those who still deal with it on a daily basis. Those who were outraged didn't need a show exploring the complexities of the thing when they are still living with evil and its tendrils every day. Maybe I'm also that sort of deaf?I want to understand what's behind evil, not to rationalize it, but because the people who so often have perpetrated it throughout history have looked and lived and been raised like me. I don't want to forgive them,  I don't want to sympathize with them - but I do want to get at what has made it possible, to grasp what makes it still possible today. But, when someone has treated you as disposable, when you live each day under laws and realities that laugh in your face, maybe all you want is for evil to be called out by name, and for those who it has pushed down to finally be recognized. Maybe thinking or discussing or trying to understand is the same as blinking or looking away. Those of us who have, through no quality of our own, avoided that sort of suffering, perhaps, should simply be quiet for once. Maybe discussion and dialogue don't have a place here, at least not yet, not until we've come to where the evil occurred, and truly seen what was done.I don't know. I guess that's the point. I haven't known.",1,come-and-see
49329,"i walked in expecting to loathe this, given i regard swiss army man as one of the worst films of the last decade. but while that film's obnoxiousness and moronic attempts at pathos were more or less immediately obvious, i was really surprised to find the prologue of everything everywhere all at once winning me over. that goodwill evaporated gradually over the course of the next hour, and by the final 90 minutes i was wondering how i'd been tricked so easily. i guess it comes down to the fact that the reasons i expected to hate this movie are a far cry from the reasons i ended up, if not quite hating, at least strongly disliking it. i really expected this to be annoyingly and exhaustingly hyperactive, a collection of quirky and wacky imagery in search of anything to say. the movie is exhausting for sure, but it's mostly because of how brutally long it is and how mercilessly it turns every throwaway gag into an extended emotional catharsis. i thought a lot of those gags were good! and then the film spends a good five minutes each of its ridiculously bloated finale making sure that every stupid joke gets wrapped up with a neat little bow. it's a particularly modern screenwriting disease, where even attempts at surrealism are forced into a tidy three-act structure. by the time evelyn was making up with her daughter (a moment that frustrated me because queer daughter/mother stuff is very esther-pitched so it SHOULD have hit me hard) i just didn't care anymore, because it came at the end of an interminably long sequence of evelyn making up with every other major and minor character, a series of conversations so punishingly rote you could almost call it parody. to go a little longer on it, the daughter stuff really bugged me because it's just so offensively half-baked. she gets a line to evelyn about ""the pain of having you as a mother"" but the film really glides right over the idea that an alternate evelyn was so abusive to her daughter that she induced a reality-destroying mental breakdown. i get that the film is from evelyn's perspective and i did appreciate that even the main one is depicted as kind of a shitty narcissist but idk, seems sloppy to make the pain a mother inflicts on her lesbian daughter the crux of your film while sweeping it under the rug so desperately! if it turns out neither of the daniels are even gay i'll be madder.people called this movie original, but i'm not seeing it. i think the recent moderate cultural obsession with multiverse movies comes about because they're a neat metaphor for pastiche, and everything these days is pastiche. what good is a multiverse if it doesn't all cross over and come together, after all? this film is pretty clear about the stuff it's ripping from (the score quotes the main theme from the matrix at one point, leading me to the infuriating revelation that the daniels are ""the only good matrix movie is the first one"" people) but that doesn't make it any less dull to see the parade of references play out. there is some small novelty in seeing what will probably be the only film ever to reference both in the mood for love and ratatouille, but that only can take you so far. i really only saw this at all because i saw that it was the most popular movie on this website ever, and i heard from several friends who found it moving, and i thought well damn maybe there's SOMETHING here. if there was i didn't see it. this thing had completely vanished from my memory by the time i got home from the theater. what enjoyable moments there are are completely drowned out by the long, long, long, long ending. it's better than swiss army man. maybe by their next film the daniels will have upgraded to ""fine"". they certainly showed flashes of mediocrity here.",2,everything-everywhere-all-at-once
67068,"Kobayashi Ranked Does anyone in the history of cinema have a better decade than Masaki Kobayashi's 1960s? Coppola's 70s and Kurosawa's 50s certainly come close, but the number of consistently astounding films Kobayashi released in the 60s may trump them all. Samurai Rebellion is just another entry released during the unrivaled peak of this auteur's career.Masaki Kobayashi is a filmmaker who wears his philosophy on his sleeve. His films aren't complex, but they are thematically deep. What remains constant throughout his filmography is his mantra: this world isn't meant for good people. Harakiri, Samurai Rebellion, The Human Condition: what do they have in common? Gross, unchecked, unpunished, injustice. There is no retribution for our moral protagonists. There is only a brief glimpse of life before death, unrealized dreams and the oppressive structures our characters rebelled against are the only things left standing. In Harakiri, we see Tsugumo succeed in his shallow revenge before the cruel gears of bushido churn onward, his sacrifice but a brief hiccup in the total authority of 16th century Japan. In The Human Condition, we see Kaji's torturous adventure bring him to the point of insanity as he teeters along the frozen edges of Siberia. The irony is that in this insanity he has found some sort of reprieve from the oppressive world, both natural and manufactured, around him. And then he dies. Here, in Samurai Rebellion, Isaburo's life was that of a slave: to swordsmanship, to his lord, to the uncompromising customs of filial piety and bushido. On the final eve of his life, having since rebelled against these horrific power structures, can he finally declare himself ""alive."" Then, wielding his signature irony, Kobayashi comes along with guns and an army and everything else power can afford and peppers our protagonist with bullets in the film's climax, leaving all his aspirations for reform and justice in a pool of blood amongst a windy field of barley. What makes Samurai Rebellion different than The Human Condition and Harakiri, is that Isaburo's unquestionable moral correctitude (is that a word?) gets not only himself but his entire family into deadly trouble. In Kobayashi's prior films, we witness sacrifice made by individuals, with individual consequences. Here, Isaburo makes a sacrifice with considerable disregard for his family's reputation and position. Even after he has relinquished his power, he still pulls the strings, commanding his son not to give in to their lord's demands like he himself did for twenty years. His son's passion ignites a fire inside him, a fire that consumes his entire family in the process. It's a hefty little wrinkle Kobayashi inserts here, and in my opinion takes Samurai Rebellion's message and puts it above his other masterpieces. While Harakiri and The Human Condition act as shining examples of the power of the morality play, Samurai Rebellion feels the most realistic and morally debatable. Despite containing Kobayashi's most nuanced take on his oft-retreaded themes, what holds Samurai Rebellion back from perfection are its mildly unfulfilling moments of heavy-handed melodrama and a glacially slow first act. The build up is worth it, and the worst bits of melodrama are surrounded by excellence, so I'll keep any deep-dive into these criticisms to a minimum.All in all, Samurai Rebellion is another masterwork from a master craftsman, one of whom we need more of in today's landscape of cinema. We're already cynical. What I think we need are more tales of good people living in this kind of world, a world not meant for them.",8,samurai-rebellion
29050,"74%""I don't know. Thousands of years ago it crashes, and this thing... gets thrown out, or crawls out, and it ends up freezing in the ice.""Basically, Carpenter's cult horror film ""The Thing"" is a wintry Earth-based version of ""Alien"". Admittedly, I really like Ridley Scott's classic, so it only hurts more to say that The Thing left me quite a bit unsatisfied. Without a doubt what Carpenter has done here is impressive. By that I mean first and foremost the practical effects he and his team crafted together and that in the 80s. But the source of inspiration is clearly visible and I just had the feeling that the film lacks originality. Above all, it also takes the almost exact same problems from Alien (that I noticed) and continues them disastrously. And somehow it lacks a skillful suspense that I was waiting for all along. Also atmospherically the film could only convince me at times. In the whole it just doesn't want to work here, as many people can call the film a classic and masterpiece, as many say, I have no idea. One aspect in which both films have the same weakness is the supporting characters.  It always seems to me like they don't give a damn about them and they are just fodder for the aliens, which is true, but they treat them that way. The men of the research station are too poorly fleshed out and sometimes seem really strangely bland, without any charm. We don't get the chance to meet some faces at any time, because of course the main star (obviously who it is) has to be the main star. During the movie they mention a lot of names and I was sometimes completely triggered because I just didn't know who was who. They could have just as easily been called Doctor, Engineer, Flamethrower Man, Fireman, or Good Looking Guy of the movie and I would have figured out on my own which name goes with which character.All in all, the aliens are not only highly creatively designed but also slimy, disgusting and vomit worthy - as they should be. Carpenter stages a horror film the likes of which would probably not exist nowadays thanks to ""great"" computer technology. You can hardly find wet hands and an accelerated pulse, which is actually what I expect from this genre. All this is enough for a good film, but does not make a masterpiece for me.

Given this excessive display of emotion, it is frankly very difficult for me to be interested in the story or even care for the characters. As a result, any commentary on marriage and relationships, unhappiness, dissatisfaction and social expectations, or any criticism of American society at the time, are of little importance to me.

""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" is two hours spent in the company of the most repugnant married couple ever, being privy to a battle royale between them in which every grievance and regret accumulated over the course of their marriage is exposed to a poor young couple who stumbles into their home for drinks, much like the innocent victim who stumbles into the lair of Jigsaw in a ""Saw"" movie. This movie is the emotional equivalent of torture porn. It would be powerful stuff if either Richard Burton or Elizabeth Taylor seemed to possess any naturalistic acting tendencies. Instead they shriek and shout at each other over and over and over again until the intensity becomes boring, grating. This is a very hard sit. George Segal and Sandy Dennis fare better as the younger couple. They seem more like actual human beings than whatever Taylor and Burton are. Even during the rare moments when one of them starts to do something that feels genuine, raw or real, the other will bluster and trample all over it, rendering it nothing but hollow screaming, of which this film has a great deal.

32583,"One year into working on his passion project Boyhood, director Richard Linklater expanded into the second part of another, much longer in the making experiment that shatters the dimensions of cinema itself and reaches its way into the deepest recesses of our emotions. With the first part of his Before Trilogy Before Sunrise, we are introduced to Jesse and Celine as the spark of their mutual respect and connections begin to take shape. Now, nine years later with Before Sunset, we run into another meetup between these two long lost friends, after only knowing each other for a day and separated by years and distance. The conversations initiated in Sunrise are continued but with a different tone about them. These two aren't the same people we met in the last installment. They're much older, a little bit wiser perhaps, and it's clear through their emotions and expressions that they've been through some serious circumstances between then and now. But the subtle romanticism in their relationship is always there, despite Jesse having been married during their time apart and having a child of his own. Their conversations always range on current events and sociopolitical topics (as is the typical nature of Linklater's artistic features), but there's a forlorn expression hidden behind Jesse's smiling face that makes it obvious he wishes he could have stayed behind before. His words reveal that Celine stil occupies a very large part of his memory, essentially quietly overtaking the place that his wife should be in. One would think that Celine should be disturbed by Jesse's nonchalant yet emotional expressiveness about his own feelings, and yet there's no doubt in our minds that she would feel exactly the same. A brief tender moment late in the film shows Celine lovingly about to reach for Jesse's head just before pulling it back before he can see it. It's a brilliant bit of body language that is far more telling of Celine's own emotions than anything else she could say during this 80 minute runtime could have revealed to us. It's always interesting to wonder about what could have been. What could have turned out completely different in Jesse's life had he stayed in Vienna with her instead of going forward with his natural life obligations.But for a few brief moments in the fading hours of the afternoon and evening, Celine and Jesse forget a lot of their current affairs to focus on each other. They're back to that same freely conversational position that they found themselves in during the last film, albeit with much more at stake in each other's lives. It's revealed through dialogue- unfolding with stunning long takes that follow these two characters as they meander the Parisian streets- that their lives occasionally intersected at brief moments between their longer encounters; and it becomes clear as they become more and more aware of each other's happenings in the past nine years, that this is entirely a conversation on what could have been. Maybe Jesse was meant to never leave Vienna and start life anew with Celine. Maybe their coincidental occupational moments are signs that there's something greater at work between them in their lives than they would have thought. Before Sunset is a rumination on what could have been- a melancholy glimpse at star-crossed romantics that slowly reveals the pain of what each of them had missed in an instant.",9,before-sunset

87968,"At this point, each new Wong Kar-Wai movie is just another opportunity for me to think about what it is that I don't like about his style. In Happy Together, I found the ever-moving camera and often too intimate close-ups offputting -- but of course that alone is hypocritical; I just praised American Honey, which did the same thing. The problem is in some nuanced detail I'm missing, or some particular combination of elements. And maybe now I've figured it out, or I'm at least on the trail of one thing that bugs me. It exists somewhere in the intersection of how scenes are filmed and how they're edited together. Essentially, I can tell there is actually tight control behind Happy Together, but nonetheless, it feels disjointed. Messy. Haphazard. I'm not discounting the work involved in creating the ""free, loose"" style, because I know that if scenes were actually hastily slapped together they wouldn't get that feeling; it requires deliberate effort. Regardless, I think that's what bothers me. It pushes me right out, distancing me such that even when the shots get beautiful all I can think is ""yeah I see you showing off"" when in any other movie I'd love them. Through my eyes, Wong Kar-Wai's films are a gorgeous vase that has been shattered into thousands of pieces and glued back together. I don't even mean badly, the person gluing it did a damn good job, but it's always going to be a vase covered in cracks and missing spots now. Essentially, the film is linear and not actually difficult to follow, but it always feels rough and like it's missing spots. As if at any point it's going to fall apart into all those pieces because someone forgot to put proper support into it. It's uncomfortable airing complaints that make me sound this boring and rigid, but the point isn't that I think movies need to be all nicely structured, it's just that the way Wong Kar-Wai does it puts a wall between me and any sort of connection in most cases (I do like Fallen Angels a decent bit and Chungking Express slightly less, but the style is still to a smaller degree my problem with them). Kar-Wai isn't wrong to do these things; it's just subjectively not what works on me.The acting is great, the cinematography is beautiful, there's a nice soundtrack (Frank Zappa!), it serves as a good exploration of a toxic relationship, and yet I am fighting back the urge to type ""I WANTED IT TO END"" every moment I'm complimenting the things that are genuinely fantastic about it. I still think the low framerate scenes look abysmal, though. We all have to have a few famous, great directors we're not all that into.",4,happy-together-1997

It's so on-the-nose that it's very laughable at points. Ah wells. And I do ""get"" what Wilder was going after here, I'm just not onboard with the crowd of admirers of this film that seem so willing to take this trip with him. To me, it was just plodding and pedestrian and a whole lot of noise with little effect. Plus, we all knew how it was going to end and I just didn't care past the 45-minute mark. Kirk Douglas' character is so unlikable that I checked out very early in this one. He's so misogynistic and almost seems to literally hate women that it's a bit too much to get past. I was rooting for Kirk to get killed in that mine the entire time. But it's just unsettling to see the woman treated so horribly and have zero wrap-up to her story, all of which is a fault of the director. Just distasteful. Color me jaded, but I am not in the majority here (obviously). I couldn't get past the clear misogyny of the filmmaker and the utter contrivance of the plot. Go figure.",1,ace-in-the-hole

Concentrate on the three pork slices. They play the key role, but stay modestly hidden. First caress the surface with the chopstick tips."" Old man, - Film Club Ranked: boxd.it/3M2sqThe weird thing is, I don't even like ramen. The basic story of this ""noodle western"" concerns a woman named Tampopo running a struggling restaurant. When two noodle experts agree to start helping her she begins intense ramen training in order to make the perfect culinary dish. This overarching story is interspersed with a number of small and unrelated subplots that are seamlessly blended into the film. My personal favorites are the woman who squeezes everything in the super market and the spaghetti eating course but everyone will have their own that they like the most. I found Tampopo to be very well paced and entertaining from beginning to end. It's a food epic... it's a food spectacular... it's a food soap opera... it's Tampopo... and it's fantastic. If they gave out Academy Awards for food pornography then Tampopo would be the run away winner of 1985. There is so much great footage of food here and I don't believe it is possible for me to want Ramen more than I want Ramen right now. I've never seen a film so dedicated to food related stories and the general art of securing ingredients, preparing a meal and thoroughly enjoying the meal...in the right and proper way. I feel like I gained weight watching this movie but what I really gained was a heaping helping of wisdom... yeah. In Tampopo, what Juzo Itami has created is a movie about dedication, obsession and finding community. I really love all of the scenes where people are eating food, or doing other things with food, in gross ways. The sound design emphasizes the weirdness but boy are you seeing people enjoy food. Even though it's a little unsettling it accomplishes giving the audience that tactile sensation of food and so it's effective filmmaking. Also though, I genuinely admire this for being a film about people figuring out relationships and helping each other. There is true kindness to this film that I appreciate. In general I really appreciate the performances in Tampopo and would generally speaking identify this as a performance based film meaning that the acting is what sells it the most. Nobuko Miyamoto does an exceptional job with the role of Tampopo. She does great work evoking feelings of desperation and dedication. She seems so frazzled the whole time and has a sincerity to her performance that makes you root for and hope that the meal finally turns out right. You feel this even though she sometimes does nefarious things to gain parts of the recipes. In general the supporting cast is really exceptional, driving the subplots especially.",6,tampopo

11208,"How are we supposed to believe the sand planet is the most awe-inspiring place in the universe after venturing into the Austin Butler Gimp Dungeon?Just as tawdry as the first…now a little more watchable. The script is still terrible and Zendaya and Timothee’s chemistry is a solid notch below nonexistent. There are liberties taken from Herbert, which I admire, but they are the worst kind of deviations this adaptation can take; the psychedelic weirdness inherent to the story has been warped to be palatably drab. Lea Seydoux’s brief horny witch stint was the only piece of the puzzle that I was fully engaged with — in large part because that whole Harkonnen planet sequence represents one of the few rare examples of formal audacity (along with an actual embrace of the bizarre) in this two-parter’s 5+ hour runtime. Beyond that, Villeneuve is too safe, too puritan and too self-serious to really see out the potential. Thus, this second chapter continues the predecessor’s streak of being a cold, shallow, brutalist space opera too reliant on massive sets and obnoxiously loud soundscapes to tell an effective story. I find myself going back to a quote the best photography professor I ever had once told my class: “If you can’t make it good, make it big.”",4,dune-part-two
15713,"When watching popular and beloved movies there is a huge risk of being greatly disappointed, which unfortunately was the case for me here.I overall still liked the movie and thought it had some shocking moments with the ending being quite a twist, but I found the movie slow and I often struggled to stay engaged.I thought Nawal’s story was interesting and I would probably have preferred only to see her flashbacks, since the twins searching for their brother and their father didn’t seem to go anywhere and it only really showed how no one wanted to talk to them because of their mother and her past. We also got to see all the things that happened to Nawal through the flashbacks before the twins learned about it, which also ruined part of the reveal for me.The story is great and apparently based a lot on true stories, but I didn’t care much for a lot of the long buildup. There were few highlights throughout the movie, but the ending was really the part that hit the hardest.The movie was really well directed and Denis Villeneuve is simply just a great director, who fills the movie with nice shots and imagery, but as I said I didn’t feel very engaged in the movie.",5,incendies

And what a perfect place to be, the cinematography and shots is nothing less then spectacular. I could rest my eyes on every shot for minutes without tired eyes.What the deeper meaning of the film is about I find difficult to define. I liked the escapades of the main character, Marcello, through the film. An adventures man traveling restless from one exciting experience to another. He searches for connection to his father, his fiancée, in addition to friendships and love from numerous women. Never quite finding what he is searching for, easily bored and on to the next chapter.

I am judging people for enjoying and recommending this.Everything Everywhere all at Once is being positioned in a way to make viewers feel smarter and more well cultured for having seen it but this is a film for babies.I should've known better from how much of a steaming pile of shit Swiss Army Man was. Sometimes good filmmakers make bad films, but It's very rare people just completely lose their entire sensibility. But enough of y'all were moved by this, that I overlooked the Daniel's past transgressions, and man I really ought to trust my gut.A certain type of person is going to respect this more and  pat theirselves on the back for watching something with subtitles, that is centered around a minority experience,  but I have never seen anything more quintessentially American in subject. Everything Everywhere All at Once is wish fulfillment of the lifelong promise that you are a unique special being at the center of the universe. If you still believe that, truly, if you still internalize that, I have bad news for you, you've watched too many Disney movies and you're too American to be saved.Everything Everywhere All at Once, also exists as a hard timestamp for the marvelalization of indie cinema. We do not need more multi-verses in film, we do not need a24 to have the same sense of humor as Deadpool. That's probably the biggest bummer  of this experience, the theater was packed, with hip young people on a Tuesday night, a significant  amount of people clapped at the end, and it was all for this fucking garbage...Everything Everywhere All at Once substitutes vague feelings, and pop spirituality for an actual point of view on the world and being alive, and this is how Malcolm Gladwell becomes a best-selling author man, y'all dont know how to critically think. Sure a lot of us have emotionally unfulfilled relationships with our parents, but vomiting that up onscreen does not necessarily make this an effective piece of art, it just means we need to work on that, possibly in therapy.

It culminates in the most romantic grand kiss in teen film history, and romance has hardly anything to do with it, and there was no dumb pointless kiss anyway.

49207,"Before Zhang Yimou's films started to become over-stuffed, jingoistic parodies of their own stateliness (e.g., Curse of the Golden Flower), he was a master of his own kind a quietly ravishing visual storytelling. Here, the camera remains stationary most of the time, but within these static shots it captures images of great vividness, opulence, and emotional intensity.Inside a palatial complex of nestled houses in 1920s China, shot as a labyrinthine and secretive edifice, hushed and lifeless and often covered by snow, the rooms come alive as expressionistic tableaux, usually fused with lush reds, passionate spaces hidden beneath calm veneers. And that visual language extends to the framing of Gong Li as well. The film's first shot is a static close-up of her face, reminiscent of the final shots of Mizoguchi's ""Fallen Women"" films, as she tells her mother that she's decided to agree to marriage with a rich man, even if that entails becoming one concubine among many. ""Let me be a concubine. Isn't that a woman's fate?"" It's a startlingly confrontational image, her 19-year-old character already wise in the ways of the world but determined to assert herself nonetheless, but at the end, chinks slowly appear in the armor, a few stray tears streaming down her cheeks.The order of the outside, even its cruel rigor, as the servants repeatedly remind Gong's Songlian about the need for upholding tradition, while passionate games of deceit and control play out between her and the three other concubines behind closed doors. A film of immense emotions, bursting at the seams of confined and controlled spaces. And ultimately, over the course of her first year as the ""Fourth Mistress,"" Songlian's story becomes nothing short of a chronicle of the death of the heart, learning just what the woman's fate she thought she knew actually entails.Writing for Slant, Steven Boone nailed the ending of the film, its great triumph but also its critical misstep, so I'll just quote him regarding that:""Songlian’s carrying all of feudal China’s crimes against women on her back inevitably breaks it, but not before her rage gets some of her sisters in the struggle killed, and only after she seizes an opportunity for revenge by using this fading society’s hysterical superstitions against it. Zhang closes with the film’s first overtly lyrical use of camera motion, a slow dolly that had me stomping my feet to Chinese opera music like it was Dead Prez. Then, a symmetrizing final close-up that fades to black on Gong Li’s haunted monument of a face. Then Zhang stitches on an unnecessary coda that over-explains and stylizes in the lazy, heavy-handed manner he had resisted up to this point. Trust, Raise the Red Lantern is still a sturdy classic worth seeing [...], but you can grab your coat at that perfect fadeout. Closing on that note, it’s one of the most beautiful indictments of a society’s character ever put on film.""",6,raise-the-red-lantern

60142,"***Vague spoilers for all of Evangelion***After 15 years of work, the Rebuild of Evangelion reaches its conclusion with Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time and it sadly doesn't pay off. The film isn't bad by any stretch, however it simplifies down Evangelion and doesn't have the impact. It tells a good story, but it does little more than that.Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 presents a different kind of Evangelion. It is an epic and one of the longest animated films in history. The first act is full of small character moments, as Shinji must accept that people do like him and move beyond his depression, and the clone of Rei goes on a quest for identity. Shinji must learn to accept responsibility and must gain the confidence to make decisions.However the most striking difference between Evangelion: 3.0+1.0, compared to Neon Genesis Evangelion and The End of Evangelion, is that Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 prioritises plot and externalities rather than becoming a finale dedicated to inner struggle as the original did. Unlike The End of Evangelion, it isn't a metatextual examination of its own viewers nor an investigation into psychology that cared little for the actual plot at hand. Instead of small internal struggle, Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 turns its character moments into big events, of sacrifice and combat. In many ways, it reduces itself down to a simple ""stop the bad guy"" story. Shinji is just a ""good guy"" and the darkness he had in the original is gone, he is no longer weak, lonely, or creepy. This isn't a film of Shinji's failure, but instead his success. The Rebuild series places the conflict between Shinji and his father Gendo much higher in its priorities than the show did, culminating here in an interesting switch. The lonely emotions of Shinji in The End of Evangelion are given to Gendo instead here. His inability to fit in is depicted beautifully, with a charcoal animation of his life that is the highlight of the film. Perhaps Hideaki Anno's perspective on life has changed, which is why he now follows the father over the boy. But what I will say is that stripping Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 back to a conventional story and switching to a simple sympathetic villain angle creates something that has none of the bravery of the show's finale or The End of Evangelion.My biggest problem with Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 is that it made me feel very little, whereas The End of Evangelion seemed to pierce my entire soul. Perhaps it is age. But I also think this ending lacks the raw energy and experimental nature of The End of Evangelion. This is a smoother movie, with less rough edges, but it was the rough edges that made the original special. Doing a version that looks more modern and makes more sense doesn't mean the soul of the work is carried over. What was fresh in The End of Evangelion is simply rehashed or referenced here, and all these new spins on those ideas ultimately provide less. The final act does get trippy and weird, but it's almost too late to save it. Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 is dense in wonderful ideas and concepts, but my connection to them felt missing. All Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 ends up being is a big collection of Evangelion ideas, placed in a slightly different order, with a few twists, and nothing that matches the originality of The End of Evangelion. My final complaint is that I also dislike the increasing reliance on 3D animation, which creates a less textured look and leaves things feeling weightless. At the end of the day it just looks worse. The End of Evangelion had some clunky animation, but it always felt ambitious and passionate. Visually Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 just feels like what I'd expect from an anime film of this budget, with no ambition.Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time is a strong slice of sci-fi anime, with tonnes of character work and a good conclusion to the strands started in the previous three films. However it cannot compare to The End of Evangelion or the show, and its decision to move away from psychology and experimentation, and to embrace a more generic story, leads to something significantly weaker and less artistically interesting. I don't dislike Evangelion: 3.0+1.0, but I cannot imagine any reason to return to it when a perfect version of Evangelion already exists.Still, the ending's beautiful and I would die for its happiness.2021 RankedEvangelion Ranked",6,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time

It's the kind of movie in which characters frequently describe the obvious or state the simple facts of their feelings, and often as ham-handedly as possible. Rather than weaving a complex tale of two brothers whose lives reverberate against one another despite great spans of time and distance, its parallel narratives are shockingly linear and simplistic, with internal and external conflicts proceeding in lockstep and lacking dynamic tension. While director Marco Tullio Giordana eschews the sensationalism of soap operas — opting instead for a static tone of precious emotionalism — he offers no creativity in terms of form or style. Bereft of visual artistry, The Best of Youth is stuck in a relentlessly repetitive series of TV-quality establishing shots and close-ups.

28076,"It took a while but here I am.The acting in this movie is truly incredible. Jack Nicholson, Will Sampson, Brad Dourif, Danny DeVito... they really all played their roles beautifully and created such believable characters. That being said, it's probably the only positive thing I have to say about this film.I didn't enjoy the story and the whole premise of the film. The head nurse is made out to be this ''evil'' person, but she's really just a product of the system she works for, in the times she works in. Did I get attached to certain characters and wanted them to thrive? Definitely, but I believe it's only because the acting was that good.I think blaming everything on Ratched is a cop out. Let's not forget McMurphy is only at the institution because he thinks it's an easy way out of being convicted for statutory rape. Did he deserve the ending he got? Probably not, but he was extremely disruptive, full on attacked the head nurse and therefore deserved some sort of punishment. In simple terms, the guys fucked shit up and unfortunately there were consequences. Am I sad about Billy? Of course. But I don't think blaming Ratched for his actions is fair.I can see why this movie is so beloved. On a technical aspect, it's incredibly well done and beautifully produced. However, the story didn't sit well with me. It didn't make me happy, and left me with a sour aftertaste.The bottomline is, McMurphy should've just served the very short prison sentence he was given instead of get himself declared insane.",4,one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest
21079,"Palme d’Or Winners Project, 1984The broad empty landscapes of dusky Southern American seem impossible to fill, such is the scope and size of the land. Yet one man has walked for what seems like forever, a solitary figure burning with quiet determination, pervading everything around him. With the remnants of home laying far behind life can only move on when this journey is at an end.The mystery that lies underneath this man's sad, deep brown eyes is in no hurry to reveal itself. Four years spent wandering figuratively and literally through the wilderness has left it buried deep inside, its burning coals the only thing to sustain him for so long. Any tears have long been dried out by the unforgiving sun, his memories threatening to dry and crack under the heat.Emotions are the driving force of this beautifully written adaptation. Like this fragmented family we have to be patient and wait for our rewards carefully constructed across the sparse narrative. There is so much yearning between these people who need to be reunited, even if it is for a short time, a level of restlessness that only comes when souls cannot be satisfied.What makes this feel so earnestly real is the absence of any cheap tricks or ploys tricking us for an emotional connection. Harry Dean Stanton was plagued with doubt over his ability to be the focal point of the film yet there is no-one else who could possibly have played this role. Travis' story is all in that face. It feels like very little acting is happening, almost as if Stanton is injecting his own soulful pain into this man's life.Ry Cooder's poignant score and Robby Mullers simple, evocative photography inform us of the characters almost as much as the words they deliver. Nothing feels underdeveloped by Wenders, no dry rock left unturned in telling us their tale. We may want more for Travis by the end but it ends on the perfect note with the road once again set out before him.",9,paris-texas

Tarkovsky’s films are always challenging and profound intellectually, but with the exception of Solaris his films haven’t hit me too hard emotionally. The Sacrifice, on the other hand, absolutely wrecked me. It’s such a beautiful exploration of hope and despair, asking how much we are willing to sacrifice for the ones we love and how far humans will go to maintain hope.

In my head I am a recurring guest on ‘The Graham Norton Show’. He was so good as playing an unhinged character that is trying to hide their unhinged-ness. The overwhelming and unnecessary politeness really did it for me. I am glad his monologue was actually funny, I do not think I could have handled the second hand embarrassment if he did not deliver. I did want to watch this film after seeing Francesca Scorsese’s Tiktok about asking her Dad to define Gen Z slang words and using ‘The King of Comedy’ to explain ‘slept on’.",6,the-king-of-comedy
89334,"Federico Fellini is certainly an interesting director to say the least and he clearly has something going for him but so far, this being my second film of his, I have not been enjoying his work at all. I wouldn't say these are bad films, thus I'm giving it a 3 and not a lower rating, cause if I was to base my rating purely on my enjoyment of the film, I'd rate it a 1.5 because this was such a slog to get through. Maybe Fellini and I just don't mix or maybe I'll eventually have to give him another chance, either way 8 1/2 is no masterpiece in my mind, rather but dull and repetitious slog of another man's clashing philosophy with his creative work and his life and a bunch of other stuff I'm too lazy to get in too. Would I recommend 8 1/2?

55074,"After adoring Nights of Cabiria, and loving 8 ½ , it seemed like the appropriate time to take another dip into Fellini’s pool with a film that many consider their favourite.I had no foreknowledge going in that this is what influenced The Great Beauty, a film I detested so much that I walked out after about 15 minutes ( actually walked out twice, first after 10 minutes, and then, after deciding to give it another try and continued, walked out again after another 5 ).  I was positively giddy watching the opening scene of ‘Flying Jesus’, there was a big smirk across my face.  It wasn’t just the symbolic imagery, but also the wonderfully creative cinematography.  Of course seeing Marcello’s chase helicopter swerve around to visit a bevy of privileged bathing beauties, only to have them cast him off, further increased my mirth.  I could tell I was going to love this one.The skewering of celebrity and religion as we continued the first act was familiar from the previous films I’ve seen, but this time with the added element of the paparazzi.  Lise and I looked at one another at some point and agreed, this is where The Great Beauty drew its influence.  While I hated … HATED the opener of The Great Beauty, here I felt I was being more gently guided into the over the top hedonism of celebrity and privilege.  I thought the party scene was great fun, where I equated The Great Beauty opening party scene with a migraine.  So far so good, and I’m thinking a solid 4 stars at this point.  Here is where we took our first quick break.  I was surprised to see my better half was less than enamored.  I did notice, though, that what we had watched so far seemed to be too much of a good thing.  I remembered Fellini being more compact in the previous outings.We returned to his run-though of religion, and the false celebrity and popularity in its name.  Again, I had seen it before, and I was now starting to get the feeling that perhaps he was getting to be a bit overindulgent and repetitive.  When we moved onto the third act, where Marcello mingles with aristocracy, I was solidly thinking that Fellini was just talking on too much, and I was seeing more and more of the same.  My mood and rating were beginning to wane.  I wasn’t that surprised that when we reached the sybaritic Cha Cha club scene with Marcello’s father that my better half wanted to bolt.  We took another break, and I commiserated that my opinion had dropped considerably in what, I had thought, was the third and final act ( foolishly not checking the runtime before embarking on this cinematic journey ).  As I had bolted from The Great Beauty, and Lise went back down to take one for the team, I felt it was my turn.  This wasn’t really too much of a hardship, as I didn’t hate at this point by any means.The little hissy fit scene in the roadster with Marcello and Emma was a bit overdrawn, and the reversals a bit contrived.  I already knew about that struggle that Marcello was facing, especially because of the somewhat disturbing revelation by his friend Steiner in a previous scene.  I’m at about 3 stars at this point, but things aren’t looking good.I thought that this was the end, though.  I thought conclusions were going to be drawn based on the previous scene, and there would be a tidy and insightful epilogue.  No, apparently not.  Although we already spent time with the overindulgent aristocrats, it seems that wasn’t enough.  We had to have the ‘break in’ party.  This is where I truly started to equate La Dolce Vita with that opening party scene in The Great Beauty.  I was now starting to hate this film with every fibre of my being.  My finger quavered over the stop button.  While the entire film is misogynistic, this was charting new territory.  I’m in the ½ star territory right now.  This is the most indulgent I’ve seen Fellini, and probably the most indulgent scene I’ve watched in recent memory.Now, onto the new Steiner scene.  I really don’t know what to say or how to feel.  It didn’t make me feel more ill will, but, it certainly didn’t make me feel better about it.  I deplored the message, but it was a message, and you can’t deplore a film delivering a position.  It certainly was poignant, especially with regards to the paparazzi involvement.  Heartbreaking, really.  My biggest problem is that it seemed to be a position without balance, but I think now that was Fellini’s intent.  We’re up to two and a half stars now.The final scene, a now familiar roundup, offered that tiny, tiny, glimmer of hope, but by far the most diminutive of the films of his I have seen.  It’s also the first where the outcome is clear.  I appreciate how he ended it, even though I would have preferred if he had kept to the style of his previous outcomes.  Although a first impression, which may change on a rewatch, I think this would have been a much better two hour film rather than a three hour film.  I get that ‘indulgence’ is the central core of the story, but function doesn't necessarily have to follow form.",5,la-dolce-vita
79873,"adorably sadAmour is a film that brings us closer to the daily life of an elderly couple, their complicity, their acts of affection, their disputes... their life, their love. But senescence soon takes its toll, illness grips the woman, and a shadow darkens her entire peaceful existence, putting them to the test.Each scene exudes subtlety and intelligence, one can even say that it is one of the most moving reflections on love that I have seen in cinema, because it is more radical, more sincere and more tender. Because it escapes from falsehood in the same way that it approaches the abyss of what true love means, just at the moment in which the word is most tested, also demonstrating that in the moment in which we live , deeper and more urgent debates are necessary about what the dignity of the human being is. I love how this entire film is the way Haneke sees love, and it is the complete opposite of the previous one I saw from him (The Piano Teacher), despite being totally different, I loved both! I'll wait in a few days to see CacheIn short, it is a film that, although it is slow, very slow, is worth visiting even once. A piece of great cinema, a piece of real life trapped in celluloid that makes you smile, terrifies and shakes every fiber of emotion. A film not for everyone's tastes, but of undeniable quality, Haneke creates an essential work.#6 film of year with 200 films ☆",7,amour

48570,"As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in. I’m going to divide this review into two sections to satisfy all possible inquiries into the matter. Let us first deal with Alfonso Cuaron’s Children of Men insofar as relates to the source material, P.D. James’ novel. To be blunt, it is a flaccid, impotent adaptation. Cuaron can’t mess with the core symbolism, simply because it’s inherent to the story in a very fundamental way, but he does his best to suck out as much of the Christian content (non-flattering and otherwise) and replace it with political yammering and a vague, crazy-sounding spirituality (the single exception to this being the soldiers crossing themselves.) The ending of the novel is one of the most theologically and spiritually uplifting sentences I’ve ever read. I felt no such transcendence with the film.Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, let’s talk about the movie apart from the novel... yeah still disappointing. Similar to my experience with Gravity, I was impressed by the technical craftsmanship on display, with the lovely cinematography and production design, all the while feeling almost absolutely nothing. Cuaron, in my humble opinion, lacks a feel for both the spiritual and the emotional. Sparks of interesting symbolism (Jasper, a weed-smoking Simeon?) get frustratingly muffled by shallow, underdeveloped characters (a problem that would’ve been greatly alleviated by simply adhering to a couple very, very basic plot points from James’ book, but I’ll shut up about that.) Theo is not very interesting. Kee is not very interesting (also I hate to say it but Clare-Hope Ashitey’s performance leaves a lot to be desired.) UGH. I didn’t hate it, but the let-down is real. I’m going to stop rambling now. Somebody please get Denis Villeneuve the rights to Children of Men.",5,children-of-men
43115,"It's weird trying to summarize why this movie is so great because it's been done by so many people before me with much greater results than I could do. It's always a good thing when cinema causes feelings of joy out of the audience, but sometimes, it's even better when a film enlightens you on the sad brokenness of the world in which we live. More specifically, Bicycle Thieves is about unfairness — some people have it well, some people don't, and others work hard for things they will never receive. This film points to the things we often take for granted, and how easily the most necessary things in our lives can be taken from us without a hint of preparation or remorse. You might feel hatred for the hardships you endure. Some of us rejoice in suffering because trials produce good character; others find themselves overcome by it, losing sight of morality in desperation before quickly becoming the thing that caused their harm in the first place. Vittorio De Sica and Carlo Montuori make exceptional use of lighting and staging without any fancy sets or camera techniques in this neorealism-led drama, opting for a visual style that, paired with a marvelous screenplay, invites the viewer into the bleakness of our reality that we often try to ignore.

17003,"This is a lascivious gimmick merely intended to shock and titillate the audience, no more no less. It mechanically follows the exact same plot from the novel on which it is based; what’s new is the sexually explicit imagery that Park has added onto to his own sexual liking.What’s truly repugnant about this picture is that it tries to masquerade as a “feminist” film when it really is just another grossly gratuitous flick. The newly added scenes that contrast men and women serve as a shallow excuse for Park to pursue whatever kinky lesbian scenes he’s dreamed of filming; Park seems to be shouting, “Look how well I understand women! Men are pigs; women are beautiful! Lesbians rock!” So, even when he shows the girls sixty-nining or scissoring together for a long while, it isn’t to be seen as obscene for it is all part of his way of elevating women. Riiiight. I think Park is too delusional to see it himself that when he says he understands women/lesbians, he really means that lesbian sex gets him off.And I don’t know what it is with lesbian films of late (helmed by male directors, by the way) that have a tendency to vilify men in their lousy attempts to celebrate lesbianism, which is absolutely unnecessary and downright untruthful: some women love men and enjoy having sex with them.

20907,"A roadtrip through the Mojave Desert, lost memories & trying to piece together what happened - setting up a mystery to be uncovered. It sure is a hell of an interesting premise. Travis is introduced to us as this quiet, lost, unassuming and traumatized man, who doesn't really know what happened or where he is, let alone how to interact with society. It is a sympathizing portrait of a man who's probably lost it all due to an unfortunate circumstances and has been gone for so long that not even his own son views him as a father. It's quite tragic, really. His brother and sister-inlaw extend their utmost sympathy and understanding for him, giving him a place to stay, taking care of him and trying to help him recover his memories. They push Hunter to bond with him and try to make the two reconnect. Everyone is quite careful and considerate, really, as no one knows what happened but everyone thinks it must've been awfully devastating and traumatising. And the film maintains this caring and sympathizing tone for him throughout its runtime. I've noticed a way too convenient pattern long before the reveal of what actually happened between Travis and Jane. The film takes a lot of emotional shortcuts to deepen our sympathies with Travis. At first he doesn't talk, but after a short while, he does. He doesn't really know how to interact with society anymore, but after a little while, he is able to be function in society again. Hunter is highly skeptical of his sudden appearance and hesitant of acknowledging him as his father, but after a while acknowledges him as a father and even goes as far as to go away to a roadtrip to find his mother one day after school. Everything seems to line up for Travis without him doing much at all. Despite the film's penchant for sitting with the shots of scenery, it doesn't seem to have the patience to sit with uncomfortable emotions and situations regarding Travis. It creates a weird phenomenon where not only the film strays from making Travis uncomfortable, the characters in the film do the same - everyone and everything is walking on eggshells around him.Now the pattern wouldn't cause me such discomfort if it wasn't a setup for what the mystery, the 4 year long disappearance of Travis, ultimately was about, and what it means for Hunter and Jane. Let's take it from the first time we see Travis interact with Jane. He finds her workplace and searches for her in it, until he manages to talk to her in one of the booths. When he asks for her, he asks for a person who is very young (something we'll come back to later). The reveal of Jane (Nastassja Kinski)'s character, as spellbinding as it might be framed with the set design and her costume and look, doesn't take long to reveal a certain side of Travis. It isn't long until he asks very intrusive and jealous questions that are completely sex worker-phobic. But it doesn't stop there, as this moment reveals a piece to the puzzle of the mystery. It's Travis' destructive jealousy swelling up again that was a contributing factor to the demise of their relationship. In this moment, 4 years removed from what happened, in a time where Jane has made a new life for herself whilst still supporting her son from afar financially. Meanwhile, Travis was gone for 4 years and contributed absolutely nothing to their family, but has the audacity to become angry and jealous, espousing sentiment to want to know all about her life and exert a certain amount of control, if not at the very least shaming for what she does, at her. It's a moment revealing how Travis never truly dealt with emotions and notions which contributed to the erosion of their relationship. And as if that wasn't enough, it leaves Jane in a position below Travis, for what she does is unrespectable in his eyes, revealing how her sacrifices and hard work mean nothing to him.I was feeling quite uncomfortable at this point already as I had quite the idea of what the cause of Travis' disappearance was. But nothing could've quite prepared for the second booth talk they were having was framed. Before Travis tells the story, he turns himself away before saying anything about it. A moment that I see read overwhelmingly as deeply empathetic and caring about Travis' emotions whereas I personally see it as a cowardly one because he can't own up the person he has abused. Whilst they both had their child living with them, mind you. It's another choice emblematic of how much consideration the film gives to Travis. Meanwhile, Jane is faced towards him, eager to listen and understand. As the story is told, we get to see a lot facial expressions of Jane as she slowly breaks down due the memories coming back to her. They're painful ones, deeply rooted in her conscience and reliving them in her mind puts her through a world of hurt - a hell of his creation. Here's where we get the full story of what happened. About how they met when she was really young, underage even, and how Travis was overly jealous and playing emotionally manipulative tricks on her. How she got pregnant and started 'becoming a person full of anger', something he describes as something very hard to live with and that he couldn't understand. After all this time, he still hasn't for once put himself in her shoes, how it must've felt to be pregnant with a child from someone who emotionally abuses you. And that isn't all. Once Hunter entered the world, Travis started physically assaulting and restraining her. He describes how he chained her to the bed with a bell so that whenever she would try and escape this domestic hellscape, he would hear and be able to run after her and bring her back, trapping her over and over again. It's omitted how Hunter was alive during all of his and how even if he has a very young child at the time, it must've been left an impression on him. Children notice when things go awry in their household, especially when it is this apparent and visceral abuse. It contextualizes the hesistance of Hunter embracing Travis as a father, but it is never touched on by the film itself, or mentioned by Travis at all. For he is wholly consumed by telling his side of the story in order to make her remember everything and tear her down. It is his act of repentance. He views retelling what happened, him dating, emotionally abusing, getting an underage girl pregnant as an older man, and domestic abusing and trapping her in their trailer (!) as him coming to terms with what happened. It is a moment framed with such emotional weight, but to me the majority of the weight and response is to be carried by Jane. She is the one who is reliving memories of her abuse, and when it's her time to respond to him, she tells him how she felt bad about all these years and how she hears his voice in every man, proclaiming an atmosphere of forgiveness and a wish for reunification. So much so that when Travis tells her that she should meet Hunter in the hotel, she wants her to come with him. The film views Travis telling her what happened, mind you without any sort of introspection or explicit confession of guilt and sorrow, as him being absolved of his injustice, ready to be embraced by the victim of his abuse, with the promise of recreating their family dynamic. It's another moment emblematic of how little the writers cared for anyone but Travis, because to frame years of domestic abuse with sympathy for the abuser whilst making the victim the one who wants to make up and forgive this way is absolutely horrific.And here's where I want to talk a little bit about domestic abuse. How being stuck in the same place as your abuser without being able to escape is one of the most horrific things a person can experience. To see no way out, to be denied agency, an escape, let alone a life on your own away from constant abuse, hurt and control. In a lot of cases the feelings of love one has for the person who abuses you, that you've developed by things starting becoming this awful, make things even more complicated. It creates this contradiction, this painful contradiction in your head that might make you think the abuse you're suffering is a sign of love, a sign of care. And even if you don't, you might be stuck in this toxic feedback loop where you think things might get better, that if you behave a certain way they expect to you, that they'll leave you unharmed, unscathed so you may be able to go through your day and sleep at night. But the thing is you don't sleep well at night anymore for a long time. Much less so if you're chained to a bell that alarms your abuser of any move you make. Most DA victims don't have the means to escape materially either, as the finances are controlled by your abuser who has access to private information of yours. If you have a child with them, it complicates the issue further because they will witness the abuse and therefore take collateral damage psychologically, if not physically, too. It's an absolutely horrifying situation to live day in and day out. For someone to overcome the intense psychological and physical abuse DA puts one through is an indescribably difficult task. Because not only does it require escaping the environment you're stuck in, it requires learning how to live without the constant fear of pain and repercussion, of someone scrutinzing your every move and punishing you for them, even if you didn't do anything wrong. The way it conditions you to behave in your daily life and around other people, the sound of a door opening or the keys in the lock. The way it makes it impossible for you to have a good night's sleep in fear of danger, for your nights haven't been quiet in a long time. You can never truly get rest, always have to watch out, because the fear and trauma won't stop lingering, haunting you. It is something horrifying and deeply damaging to have been through domestic abuse. And here is where I come back to Jane, a person who is managed to escape her abuser after all she's been through. Jane is such an incredibly strong and brave person. She built up her own life and is making sure to give financial support for her child. She has managed to cope with the pain she's suffered and is moving forward. She removed herself from her abuser as far as possible. She created a life free from him, and decided her son would be better off with a loving couple who will care for them as if he was their own child. And then comes Travis, not only uprooting the life of his own child, his brother and sister-in-law, but of the person he has tormented and abused for years on end. Whilst she was pregnant, whilst they were living together with their child. And this happens in a film where his disappearance is framed as a mystery, where everyone is kind and understanding to Travis who looks like he's been through a lot. A film that spends two hours sympathizing with him only to give us an emotional climax where is absolved of what he's done because he's remembered what happened and made his victim relive the traumatic experiences. And in the end, he doesn't even have the courage to look her in the eyes when saying all those things. It's such an emotionally manipulative trajectory and conclusion, and I feel so terrible for Jane, who is given little to no consideration. For who being reunited with her son is supposed to be the 'make up' gift. It is a film ignorant of the sacrifices she has made a woman who has suffered emotional and domestic abuse, for her child, and how much it took for her to free herself from Travis' tyranny. For the film to equate it as 'two lost souls trying to find their way back to each other' or assigning even a modicum of equal blame or fault to them is not only thoroughly misogynistic, it's dismissive of victims of domestic abuse. The fact that she was underage when they met only makes this worse. I can't for the life of me abide such an emotionally manipulative and disregarding framing. It's a film wholly consumed by its sympathies for Travis, which takes every emotional shortcut possible to make us root for him, despite the fact that he's someone who preyed on an underage girl, domestically abused and trapped her in a trailer with their own child. It is wholly morally irresponsible and misguided in its sympathies. And no 'beautiful cinematography' or shots of the Mojave Desert could make up for this, if anything they reinforce the insidious and manipulative nature of the film which ends up making people root for Travis.Last but not least, I want to highlight something that happened to Nastassja Kinski that isn't widely known: what Wim Wenders put her through when she was a mere 12 years old. A child. He went ahead and sexualized her in one of his movies, Wrong Movement (1974). Read about it in the quote below from an interview with Nastassja Kinski with The Telegraph in 2001.""At 12, having been talent-spotted in a disco in Munich by Wim Wenders's wife, she appeared topless, and the victim of a grown man's half-hearted slap, in Wenders's Wrong Movement (1974); at 14 she played the young nun, writhing in lust, by whom the satanist Christopher Lee pined to have a child in To The Devil A Daughter (1976); at the same age she had the lead in Wolfgang Petersen's Reifezeugnis (1977), playing a schoolgirl who has an affair with her teacher; two years later she was, again, a naughty schoolgirl in The Passion Flower Hotel (1978) – ""I'd like to find every copy of that film and burn them"" – and, that same year, she appeared naked with Marcello Mastroianni in the execrable Stay As You Are. Had she, in some way, felt abused? ""Let's put it this way,' she says: 'If that was my daughter, I wouldn't allow that. I wouldn't allow certain people to say certain things or to try certain things.""Now, excuse me, for I am too thoroughly sickened by this film and what Wim Wenders and others put Nastassja Kinski through to keep on writing about this. I hope I made my feelings and thoughts clear. Thank you for reading.",0,paris-texas

34667,"Although Dreyer refuted interpretations that Ordet concerns a triumph of religion over science, it’s more persuasive to see the depicted miracle as age-old transcendence just happening to be in the present, than any validation over then-contemporary mores or practises. Certain it is medical science as practised here is a mere tool of life (or death), one that has as much practical benefit as a horse-drawn cart or the frequently deployed coffee pot. Higher things reside elsewhere; science has it’s place (the coffee pot having more reliable benefits too).That The Doctor is frequently sidelined with The Pastor is a telling one. Neither (both nameless) can quite explain away - nor gets the chance to - the mystery unfolding on their watch. There are modern parallels here. That religion, certainly in most Western societies, has largely been routed in favour of The Science can be partly explained by the readily simplified: something apparently evidence-based with little-to-no room for the intangible or unknown. Not so much what happens to the soul upon death as is there a soul to start with. It’s the overweening triumph of the didactic: if I can’t point to it, it doesn’t exist.Yet science isn’t The Science (it’s harder to say the same about the ordained tracts of religion). What should be an ongoing series of questions - challenged and refuted ad infinitum - is nowadays presented as read. This is most egregious in the adamant stupidity of those who say ‘The Science is settled’, a doubly fallacious statement. Irrational rationality at best and dangerous with it.As I write, the alarm of this situation is explicitly exposed with what can only be called Scientism, something enjoying the best of both worlds with a hammering confidence in refutable evidence (barely worthy of the name) that nevertheless bewitches and befuddles a populace with a fervour The Devil would recognise if not instigate. It’s a parlous state of affairs. With the interpretable presented as hard fact, the need for people to believe in something - anything it would appear - comes into sharp relief. Yet there’s seemingly no room for the thing that might provide refuge if not a way out of this mess.

12734,"Included In Lists:Criterion Collection - #217Here I am at another Yasujiro Ozu film, the atmosphere feels familiar, the characters feel lived in, family and modernism once again becomes a prominent aspect of this story of disconnection, regret, appreciation, and loneliness. Much like any other Ozu film, the balanced quality to its storytelling, unwilling to simply take on the perspective of a singular character provides a rich and broad texture that many filmmakers stray away from, possibly due to the difficulty of undertaking such a method of storytelling, but Ozu is a master of such a stroke, amplifying such ideas and sincerity through his precise and detailed imagery, the camera constantly positioned low on the floor, at times taking on the perspective of a room’s furniture, backed up against the wall with a wide point of view, staring up into its human subjects, glorifying his domesticated characters that exposes them and mirrors reality that traditional cinema have long denied from such archetypes.Tokyo Story explores the dissolution of children from their parents, seeking for opportunities and glory in modern Tokyo only to reach slightly above mediocrity, an outcome that is recycled in much of his films. Their parents from a rural town take on a rare trip to Tokyo, to visit their children and see the sights that they have long been missing. Unfortunately the lives of the children are hectic, appreciating their visit but unable to find a proper space within their time to give them the proper tour, to the point when the siblings have decided to rally up cash to send them to a spa that unfortunately backfired due to the youthful and night thriving life that the spa revelled in. The wife of the parent’s deceased son, Noriko Hirayama, has remained single all this time, and is the only one out of the two blood-related children living in Tokyo to give these elderly visitors the proper time of day, showing them the sense of gratitude that is simply lost in the cynical lives of their children, almost seeing them as an inconvenience.Though through Ozu’s lens, the children cannot entirely to be blamed, as its elderly characters have noted and the chosen imagery of its shots have emphasised the consuming nature of Tokyo, a place that instils hopes and dreams to the point where its residents become self-absorbed and distant from their roots, it has become a labyrinth only navigated with confidence by the youth, a place that certainly intimidates the older generation, fearing of becoming lost in its intricacies; Noriko may not see herself as a saint as she notes to her father in law the occasional selfishness of her ways, but through our eyes, and Ozu’s, she is, as she shows effort in providing these elders the respect they rightfully deserved, and is aware of her own shortcomings even if her soul is currently losing the battle.Ozu achieves a sense of sorrow for the conditions of its characters, especially towards its elders, without having to amplify the film’s drama, moments appear almost seemingly familiar from our own reality, yet we identify with it more so than a film that wears its emotions on its sleeves due to our reactions being self-generated rather than manipulated by an outside force, a testament to the master craftsman of a filmmaker and the lasting power of the cinematic form. Despite it all coming off as natural, the performances could still be easily appreciated, as it is difficult for actors to emote with a naturalistic flourish whilst remaining focused within their roles, achieving a variance from the roles they have portrayed from Ozu before, but constant in their excellence.Tokyo Story has all the ingredients it needs for a perfect Ozu film, but it all becomes stretched to a length that I felt is unjustified and lacks the emotional enveloping experience that The Only Son has left on me, which so far tied with An Autumn Afternoon has only increased my affection over time and regarded as the strongest of his work. Nevertheless, a strong entry Tokyo Story was, filled with empathetic emotions, thoughtful ideas, and strong performances from Ozu’s reliable cast.",7,tokyo-story

60976,"Everyone knows of the Nuremberg Trials. After the Nazis were defeated in World War II, these trials sought to hold accountable those responsible for the war crimes perpetrated by Hitler's regime. The bullets are done flying, blood is no longer spilled on the battlefield and the question instead becomes one of whether or not execution remains appropriate for the atrocities they have committed. It's an inherently interesting idea with complex themes on a very human level, and Stanley Kramer's Judgment at Nuremberg sets out to dramatize the events for the film audience. Centering around the trial of four judges who served in the Nazi regime, this picture uses their specific trial to work through its themes and ideas.These trials have always been one of the more interesting aspects of American history for me, and I think that those kind of morality issues that are brought up are absolutely fascinating. To what capacity should these men be held accountable for their actions? Is ending their lives really more humane than the thousands of lives that they were responsible for ending? Can you punish those who were following the admittedly horrific laws of their country? How can you put this level of an atrocity into a quantifiable term of punishment? How can someone get up and defend these people on trial? How can the people on trial themselves justify their actions?All of these questions are ones that could spark great debate and Kramer's film, as written by Abby Mann, seeks out to address most of them throughout its extensive 180-minute running time. Mann's script seems to focus itself primarily on these themes, rather than the characters themselves, which makes the occasional diversion into more character based plots feel awkward and dragged out. The questions are certainly interesting, but what's most compelling is how you answer them and Mann can't find a way to make the characters who are doing the answering to be nearly as interesting.The film casts its attention on a large ensemble of characters, but the primary focus is on Judge Dan Haywood, head of the Tribunal of men to pronounce sentencing, who is played by Spencer Tracy. Tracy does fine work throughout, particularly in his final courtroom speech, but there's a lot of time with him outside of the courtroom engaging in an awkward underdeveloped plot with a Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich) that is uninteresting and really hurts the film overall. Mann's attempt to give some character development outside of the courtroom is a nice idea, but the execution is really lacking much depth and I couldn't help the feeling that the film would have been served much better if they had kept the action entirely in the court itself. It certainly does get hurt by that lengthy running time and you could have cropped a good half hour at least out of the exterior scenes that would have helped for it to be paced much better.Pacing in general is another problem with the film, as even in the courtroom scenes I never felt like they were really building to anything. The case as they depict it doesn't have much in the way of a rise, and it seems more that the trial scenes are put together almost at random. It creates this very strange inconsistency where one scene will be incredibly gripping and the next won't measure up at all, that instead of building towards the climax just ends up being more of a roller coaster of ups and downs. Those questions that the source material asks would make it hard for any film depicting them to be uninteresting, but at times I couldn't help but feel like they were trying their best to do just that.Where the film does shine primarily though, is in its marvelous cast, which is one of the better I've seen in some time. As I mentioned earlier, Tracy is a superb lead, but the spotlight is often stolen by the more theatrical members of the group. As the head of the defense for the judges, Maximilian Schell takes a potentially detestable character and makes him astonishingly compelling all the way through. His mix of arrogance, intelligent and rage is intimidating and at times shockingly convincing in his arguments. He's balanced up against Richard Widmark's work as the head of the prosecution, a really manipulative and off-putting sort whose contrast to Schell makes for an interesting undercurrent where the ""good guy"" isn't necessarily the one you are rooting for in court.Burt Lancaster portrays Ernst Janning, one of the judges on trial, and out of that group he's the only one who gets any major character focus and through him they build an interesting study into a man who seemingly knows what is right and wrong and yet somehow found himself in the middle of these horrific acts that his regime carried out. He crafts a surprisingly sympathetic work that makes a human being out of someone who could have easily been depicted simply as a monster.The two performances that impressed me the most though were two witnesses in the case, played by Judy Garland and Montgomery Clift. As these two are put on the stand and forced to recall the terrible memories of the crimes committed against them during the Nazi reign, the two actors devastatingly display the kind of lasting impact that these experiences can have on a person. Both of them come into court hoping to put away these men and when they are sitting in a room face-to-face with them, the fear and reluctance to speak is palpable. Each of their characters is unique, with Clift's being questioned for mental competence and Garland's for her sexual behavior, but both actors really disappear into their roles and create real characters who resonate long after their appearances on screen.Judgment at Nuremberg, as a film, had the benefit of a story that was already incredibly interesting to me but I often felt like they weren't able to tackle it in a way that capitalized on that. I often found it too drawn out or inconsistent, with side plots that ultimately went nowhere and weren't able to address the themes nearly as well as some of the other elements of the picture. The cast is tremendous and really provides for many highlights throughout, but it ultimately doesn't do much to justify its extensive running time. The themes are always interesting and leave a lot of questions for the audience to discuss or reflect on once its over, but from a narrative standpoint there really is a lot that could have effectively been cut or trimmed down. I can't say that it's a bad film as there is so much going for it, but I can't say it's a very good one either.",4,judgment-at-nuremberg

60353,"Evangelion stuff rankedI suppose my main issue with this film is that it's even more of a convoluted, jumbled up soup than all the other entries, except this time not in a good way.In the original series and its alternate ending and rebuilds there were loads of options. You could either focus on the human politics element, the teenage drama element, the robots vs aliens action element, the religion vs science element, and as you were shifting your focus around all these you're able to explore the details of each layer and how they connect to the rest of the piece and come together to form something profound.With Thrice Upon a Time they travel through all these layers at once and as a result you can no longer focus on one part that interests you because it's muddled with loads more uninteresting stuff. Everything that you might want to try and focus on is intertwined with so, so many other things, as if you weren't allowed to look too closely in case it all starts to feel too shallow at this point, which this series/franchise has always been anything but.There's some interesting stuff here, I liked Shinji and Rei at the village. I liked learning about the village. Anno's brief work at Ghibli really came across during this part, and I enjoyed just being whisked away to a more slice-of-life situation with these characters for a change amidst all the high stakes, violent stuff. Unfortunately, just about everything else did nothing for me.Everything feels weirdly over-explained to the point where none of it means anything anymore and I don't get what the hell is happening. It all ends with so much mumbo jumbo and doesn't give any of the characters a fitting resolution. Rei is simply tossed away like halfway through the film after being the best part of it. Mari continues to not make any contribution to the story in any way, Misato is just... there, and what the hell is up with Asuka? Is she a clone?

The Apu of this movie is far more interesting than the Apu of first one, but that is no fault of the first movie.

The friction between parent and child, especially mother and son, gets some spotlight and I found that interesting.Can't deny the excellent filmmaking. Ray is a pure humanist director, interested in the minutiae of life without putting it through the wringer of any conventional genres.

Every time he is painted as the bad guy (usually by the people who say shit like ""All lives matter"" and ""Not all police officers are bad""), it simply goes to show how ahead of his time he was and how unprepared the country is for justice and equality. I hope one day people will realize just how right he was.

I was intrigued!And then the narrative flips to the second story...😑The second story didn't work for me. Not the sentiment. Not the humor. Not the irksome California Dreamin' on repeat. Didn't care about Faye's quirky, annoying ass. Didn't care about the cop's weird, reading-letters-is-too-hard, I-talk-to-inanimate-objects ass.

Through-out the whole film, you could pick a scene or shot that you’ve seen before just because of how many people were inspired by this. I’m mainly talking about Blade Runner. I don’t need to go into details but I think it’s pretty obvious how much this inspired the look of Blade Runner.  I was stunned by how ahead of its time it was. The effects and the editing really took me back. I couldn’t believe I was watching a film from the late 20s. This includes the set design as well. There is a reason why so many people talk about the sets in this film (they are incredible). Every single set piece, room, landscape was so impressive. From the miniatures to the massive factory floor, each and every shot was perfect. I also noticed how much acting has changed over the years. Obviously I know that it has changed but this was one of the first times I really noticed how theatrical these earlier films are. It’s helped by the grand score but the body language and how extra they had to make everything seem because of the non-existent dialogue was really fascinating to me.My rating is primarily based on how influential this film has been and how important it is in cinema. I say this because I really struggle to get into silent films. Even though I found the whole production really impressive and the story was compelling enough, I just found my self drifting away from it. I struggled to stay interested, unfortunately.(This has easily got one of the coolest posters on Letterboxd)",6,metropolis
5871,"The Human Condition: I | II | IIINo man is an island. Everyone is involved in the game of life. The dilemma of Kaji in this first volume of The Human Condition presents a horrific situation to be forced into, not of choice necessarily (though will shall become the deciding factor of this journey) but of circumstance, the doings of men who disregard all other life in lusting for the honey of success. And yet! They are dumbfounded to respond to the threat of all threat: love. From the tender patience of Michiko through her suffering with Kaji to the marching of prisoners for their fallen comrades, it sure does cause quite a tidal wave to malice’s well-kept beaches. For one person to bear such punishment for their heart in others… Love—it’s simply incapable with human nature. It’s something more.Immensely hard to watch for the sake of my care for its characters—no, its people—and yet immaculately designed to make one flinch with disgust and shout with joy, it’s one of the most involving cinematographic experiences ever committed.

84818,"What a beautifully constructed film. The intricate film-making creates such an immersive experience, the audience real delve into the life of the characters, which in this case is quite a heart-breaking place to be, despite its striking reality. This is especially effective in such a contained setting, which is just one of the many brilliant directorial decisions made in The Father. You see this is really a very simple film. There are only a few characters, which gives more room for each to be fully fleshed out, which allows us to engage with each person and their role in the story a lot more. The narrative is told somewhat in a linear manor but fuddled up and moved around to reflect the state of mind of Anthony Hopkins’ character (sort of similar to that of Memento) and that’s it. Only that isn’t it, although technically so little is done so much effect is made, this story benefits so much from simplicity because there we have so much. So much raw emotion and so much heart-breaking realism. You really feel like you are in this world firstly as a viewer, but then you begin to question yourself and your own perception and sense of being and when everything becomes clear at the end of the film you instead think of the people around you and not yourself. You think of those close to you, your family or anyone who is slowly losing touch with themselves and the world around them, only able to hold onto a few fragments of their memories. And that hits you like a ton of bricks. I watched this with two of my friends in the cinema a few weeks ago and all of our reactions when the film had finished was around the lines of “I want to call my Mum… I want to check up on my Grandad. … I miss …”. That’s impact for you. I think that gives you plenty of reason to watch this film if you are emotionally stable enough to be taken through the ringer quite a bit.

3005,"Parasite is one of the cheap efforts that came out trying to exploit the short-lived 1981-3 3-D revival fad that was inspired by the surprise success of the abysmal Western Comin’ at Ya. A whole host of other 3-D films came out but it was a hard stretch to find a single film that was even vaguely watchable, let alone good, amongst them.Parasite was the second directorial outing from a young Charles Band who, along with his father Albert, would later found both Empire Productions and Full Moon Productions, production houses that specialised in low-budget, occasionally enterprising, genre films, including the various Ghoulies, Trancers, and Puppetmaster series.Parasite has been designed as no more than an earthbound copy of Alien. The physical look of the creature has been copied directly from H.R. Giger’s chestburster, while the film comes with similar references to shady corporations wanting the creature for weapons research. Stan Winston’s cheesy parasite effects provide some low-level 3-D schlock shocks – there are some occasionally entertaining effects of parasites dropping into the audience’s faces, even an impaled pipe dripping blood out of the screen. Unfortunately, Band’s direction is dull to the point of indifference. Moreover, he makes no use of the 3-D other than to keep popping things out into the audience’s faces.Hero Robert Gloudini is an actor of remarkably little affinity for the profession. A twenty-year-old Demi Moore, in only her second film role, plays the love interest.",0,parasite

24286,"A masterpiece by a controversial filmmaker accused of sexual assault.The main reason I watched this film was my love for watching Adrien Brody’s performances. I love how he embodies the character he plays. I had known about this film for a long time, but couldn’t find the time to watch it due to its long runtime. After years of keeping this movie on my watchlist, I finally decided to watch it with Saptarshi. We both watched it for an hour and a half and then engaged in a conversation about how good an actor he is.This film is from the perspective of a Polish Jewish pianist, showing how he dealt with the situation and managed to stay alive when the Germans were trying to occupy Warsaw during WWII. Random people were being murdered on the streets, buildings were destroyed by rapid explosions, and all the Jewish population were taken to the Treblinka death camp where they were exterminated.Despite the fact that the first half of the film was a bit slow-paced, it completely absorbed the essence of the Holocaust. The second half followed the story of Władysław Szpilman who hid himself, starved for days, begged for help, and lived in the ruins of Warsaw. Brody flawlessly portrayed his character and was awarded an Oscar for the best actor for this film. It’s hard for me to articulate how I felt watching him portray Szpilman. The pain of losing touch with his family, fighting for life, and struggling to stay alive is not something that can be portrayed without having experienced it before. But Brody immersed himself in that character and gave us this outstanding performance of his entire career. His eyes were perfectly able to express the deep suffering he had to go through to stay alive, which made my heart flinch. I can’t emphasize enough how much I loved his performance.The somber orchestral background music in this film perfectly complemented the events unfolding on screen, which made me comprehend and connect with Brody’s character on a deeper level. I will watch this movie again someday just to witness his exquisite performance one more time.",9,the-pianist

Countless scenes and individual shots were visually brilliant, and the film on the whole was a treat for the eyes.The story on the other hand didn't grip me quite as much. Perhaps it was the affair-based context, or a more general disconnect from the characters, but this wasn't a film that I'd consider as one of the best of all time.

It shows condemnation of warfare through the brutal suicide mission and corrupt trial portrayed in this film, whilst also showing the reality of war and its effects on the soliders.I haven't been a fan of other Kubrick films I've seen; 2001, The Killing, and I thought The Shining was OK. I think the reason why I resonated with this one is the central theme presented here. The soldiers being scapegoats for the incompetence of the generals/commanders and these individuals in high positions believing they're doing a great job in the war effort, yet it's the soliders who are actually facing the consequences was really interesting. I loved the set designs, and I think the visual effects were great, especially for the time. The pacing was great, and the combination of battlefield/courtroom scenes allowed for some really versatile storytelling and kept the story engaging. The music was great, the single beat of the drum whilst the men are walking to their execution was so impactful at creating tension and being able to create such uneasiness with a simple sound is really outstanding in my opinion.I didn't think there would be a Kubrick film that I would really enjoy but looks like I found one here.",7,paths-of-glory

I haven't been sleeping well of late, and today was already a full and fun day with a day out round Liverpool and front row seats to see the Everyman Rep Company's production of The Sum. Plus a few drinks. Then it was the Doctor Who season finale, and all the excitement of a finale not being utter bin juice for a change and David Bradley popping up at the end as the First Doctor. Can't it be Christmas yet? And hey, this is only my second Tarkovsky...Anyway, what I'm trying to say was I was probably too knackered and my mind was probably too involved elsewhere to fully appreciate what everyone else seems to universally acknowledge as a masterpiece. Which is why for much of the running time I looked rather likes this;¯\_(ツ)_/¯And then I got annoyed with myself for being like that. I should be able to get these things, right? I'm not saying I'm Alan Billy Big Bollocks Yentob or anything like that (again; this is only my second Tarkovsky. Like a dick, it's taken me 37 years to watch anything of his) but I'd like to think I had enough about me to get this. But it turns out Mirror's intention is to be incomprehensible, and then I breathed a sigh of relief. What did strike me about Mirror and how it deals with memory in an organic, non linear way, is that it's very much like the kind of thing Terence Davies would go on to do over here (and I'm reassured by the fact that it took me two watches of Distant Voices, Still Lives to realise it was a masterpiece and Davies was a genius, so there's time for this yet I guess). But Davies used music to forge some kind of path through his work, whereas Tarkovsky here seems to be relying on newsreel footage. Intriguingly Tarkovsky considered music to be vitally important to how he structured film, obeying the laws of music as his organisational principle. It's a beautiful, but bewildering film....when you feel like you have a handle on it, it disappears like smoke or goes off down a completely unexpected path.I like the comment film critic Antti Alanen made, describing it as a ""space odyssey into the interior of the psyche"". I like that because it reminds me of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like that film, I can appreciate how seminal it is, how technically accomplished and visually and aurally magnificent it is, but I can't understand it. And if I can't understand it, it places a barrier between me and the film itself. I can't love it and that's why I've rated it as I have done.And now I'm going to bed.",5,mirror

I went into this knowing that it's one of the principal movies made about the world of ballet, although that list is a very small one. I know for a fact that this picture didn't create the tired tropes about artists as tortured, miserable creative types who are also often assholes just because they exist in a world where that kind of behavior is tolerated. But those tropes are definitely on display here, and as the film began I was quickly losing my patience with it.The big production that takes up the middle third of the movie raises the film to an entirely different plane. It's arguably the best example of ballet ever put on the big screen, although it did re-emphasize my belief that ballet isn't the best medium for telling a story, in this case a fairy tale (as for fairy tales, they are some of the greatest, most powerful and strangest stories ever created, which I've been saying for years; check them out).And then there's that last half hour.

Mr. Okayama has suffered severe disfigurement to his face due to an accident at work. He’s sarcastic and bitter about his misfortune, and it’s hard to say whether his marriage is suffering more from what the accident did to his face, or what it did to his personality. He enlists the services of a doctor who makes him a special mask that is so lifelike that he looks to be another person entirely. The characters talk about this, not as a way for our character to try and live a normal and happy life, but as a sort of “experiment” to see whether this mask will take on a life of its own. “If my fears prove true,” the doctor says, “masks like this could destroy all human morality.” (O...K...)Every time the movie would start to get interesting, we would suddenly be back with Mr. Okayama and the doctor talking about the mask, and whether the experiment was working like the doctor had envisioned, and some other philosophical shit about what it all means (and all of this feeling very repetitious by the end), but I never did feel like they were proving anything at all with their “experiment” or revealing any ugly truths about humanity, either.There is a side story involving a pretty lady with a big burn on one side of her face, and I expected the stories to somehow intersect, but they never did.

56024,"Like Arsenio Hall once relayed to his talk show’s talent scout, after watching Radiohead complete their set of ‘Creep’…’You didn’t tell me they were gonna be like that!’I was not expecting this mid-80s revengeamatic to be so layered or capable so much potential — unfortunately much of what makes Heat exceptional goes mostly underdeveloped. I’m not the first to point to professionally mediocre helmer Dick Richards as the principle gaffe here; but really, even preceding Richards’ unremarkability is Elliott Kastner (who’s career is noted for Euro-schlock aesthetics, barebones productions, rising property/talent acquisitions, and swindling at least one administration at every mini-major(s) studios — burgeoning throughout New Hollywood (and East Coast), dodging Guild(s) censures for repeatedly failing to disburse residuals (or balance sheets) to their members.Otherwise Heat is mostly remembered for…1) Screenwriter William Goldman’s script (adapted from his own novel), and2) Reynolds knocking out director Dick Richards…“When I was hired to star in Heat, the trades handled it like any other casting notice, but for me it was a godsend. Heat was adapted from William Goldman's novel about a gambler who gets in trouble with the Vegas underworld. Until producer Eliot Kastner called in mid-1986, nobody in Hollywood had wanted to offer me a job. I was damaged goods, yesterday's headlines, and though the town loves comebacks and gives awards to survivors, it loathes fire sales.By the time Heat came along, I was a powder keg of anger. Perfect, if I can use it. Unless you have a constructive outlet for such fury, though, it'll come out in some horrible, uncontrollable manner. A heart attack, a fight, somewhere—it has to.Well, the picture's main ingredients—director, writer, and star formed a pretty volatile stew. Altman and I had been dying to work together for more than twenty years.* He'd offered me M*A*S*H in 1969, but I'd been in the hospital, recuperating from parasites I picked up in Asia. When we met in Vegas I realized we might have to wait another twenty.-----* note: In actuality it was Carol Burnett who had been promoting Reynolds to Altman for years, insisting he really ought to work with the actor (albeit still prior to Reynolds induction to Top-tier box-office performer; Or rather, '...more than twenty years [ago].')-----""I don't trust him,"" Altman said, referring to Goldman. ""He smokes a pipe."" Jesus, I love Altman, loved him then and still love him now. But William Goldman smokes a pipe! Who cares?""Listen, Bob, you and I have known each other for a long time,"" I said. ""What the fuck has that got to do with the fact he's a great screenwriter?""""I can tell,"" he said. ""He's one of those guys with the pipe and the sweater who won't change a goddamn word.""""Well, what do you want to change?""""I like to improvise.""""I know,"" I said. ""So do I. But only when it's shit. This is good."" The crux of our discussion concerned a clash of styles, not anything personal, but unfortunately this difference surfaced pretty late in the game. On Friday night in my suite at the Sands Hotel, two days before shooting was scheduled to begin, Altman continued airing his concerns in a now-infamous meeting with Kastner. It ended with Bob hitting the producer with a beer bottle. If I'd done that, it would've cost me $9M. Bob said, ""Sorry, Burt, but I can't work with this asshole.""This left the picture without a director, and Eliot vowing to stay on schedule.""We've got the crew on Monday,"" he said.""We aren't going to get anybody,"" I countered. ""What self-respecting director's going to step in without any preparation, take another director's locations, cast, script changes, and so on? Unless he's desperate for a picture. Desperate!""But Kastner had already lined up Dick Richards. I hadn't heard of him. With evident sarcasm, I asked if he was a TV director.""No,"" Eliot said. ""He did some really great movies."" ""Which ones?"" I asked.""The Culpepper Cattle Company, "" he said.It was among my favorite westerns. But I also knew that Hal Needham had directed 75 percent of the picture. I'd also heard that one of the guys on the film had a terrible fistfight with the director.""He also did the remake of Farewell My Lovely,” Kastner said of the film he also produced.""Great,"" I said. ""Mitchum hit him. Not only hit him, but he dragged him onto Pacific Coast Highway and said, 'Let's see if you can direct traffic.'""""Well, he also did a film with Hackman and Catherine Deneuve,"" Kastner said.""Say no more,"" I said. ""Hackman hit him, right?""""Yes,"" he admitted. ""And so did Deneuve.""""Catherine hit him, too?""I repeated this fine resume. Three pictures, four punchouts.Sounded lovely to me. Eliot then pointed out that Richards hadn't been hit on his last movie. I asked who starred.""Martin Sheen,"" he said.""Martin Sheen?"" I asked incredulously. ""He thinks Hitler is a good house painter. Martin's like Jesus. He wouldn't hit anyone. Listen, I'll make it easy. I don't want to work with someone who's been hit by almost every actor in the business.""Needless to say, budget considerations won out and Richards showed up on Monday full of enthusiasm and ideas. He couldn't refrain from talking—talking to everyone. But everyone heard a different Dick Richards. Sweet to the producer, he criticized extras, verbally abused crew members, and took advantage of others in all kinds of bully ways. He made the wardrobe lady his private clothes cleaner. I hated his type, and told him so.# # # # # # #note: of all Reynolds’ gratuitous, vaguely specific, Dick Richards' personalty traits, there really is a consensus here (amongst principle talent and execs alike): Dick Richards is…1) notoriously indecisiveand, overwhelmingly2) not amenable to below-the-line crew/staffers.If you're the production designer, camera operator, line producer, etc. Richards values your input; Otherwise he’ll dismiss all others as teamsters or grips (regardless of actual rank). This is primarily why a surplus of Stuntmen, co-stars, focus-pullers' anecdotals regarding Richards’ natively narrow outlook. Example:“According to assistant director, Henry Lange, “Toward the end, on Farewell, My Lovely (1975), Mitchum did not like Dick. He got mad at him. Part of it was because Bob and Dick just weren’t the same kind of guys. One morning, Bob’s talking to the grips and Dick comes up to him and started talking about the scene and how there are various shades of gray he would like to see if he can bring in. And Bob says, ‘You want to suck what?’ And Dick sort of walked away. Bob would only do that if he felt you didn't respect the crew.""Excerpt From: Robert Mitchum: ""Baby I Don't Care.” by Lee Server# # # # # # #“I watched him slowly undo the cast, including Peter MacNichol and Howard Hesseman. Then one night he started in on me. It was during a scene in which the boy in the movie gets killed and dies in my arms. I wanted to play it exacty as Goldman had written, going for the most impact. However, Kastner and Richards began the trouble by debating whether or not it would be good for the box office if the kid died. Then Richards wanted to shoot the scene in a convoluted manner that veered entirely from Goldman's intent.Unable to make up his mind what he wanted, Richards decided to shoot it two different ways. That was total bullshit. It was easy to know which ending Richards was going for. I took offense. Was he going to print both? Was I going to have at least an opinion?""Let's not play games here,"" I said. ""We disagree, but let's work it out to where we're both happy.""To make a long argument short, he got in my face and jabbed me with his finger on my chest I counted four times. Others swore <out an affidavit> that it was only twice. Regardless, I didn't realize how much anger I had stored in me. The punch traveled only about eight inches—from my chest to his chin. He was about four inches taller than me. But it was like a bazooka, loaded with all the frustration and rage of the past two years.I didn't even see him fall. Assuming we'd take five, I just turned and walked back to my trailer. A few minutes later, the makeup guy and assistant director came and asked what I wanted to do. Irritated, I sighed ""Oh shit, he was wrong but you can't hit people anymore,"" and walked back to apologize. Richards, though, was still out. In fact, not only was he splayed on the pavement, the crew had outlined him in chalk like a body at a crime scene.I thought he was dead. At which point, Vegas being Vegas, the two off-duty police officers who guarded the set approached me.""When he threw that punch at you,"" one of them said, ""you had no choice but to—""It's okay guys,"" I said. ""I appreciate it. But I nailed the asshole.""Later that night I went to Richards's hotel room to make another apology. He was having dinner with his only two allies on the picture, Kastner and the art director. Kastner did not look good. I didn't waste time saying I was sorry.""I lost it,"" I said. ""No matter what you said, I shouldn't have hit you.""""What are you going to do about it?"" Richards asked so smugly I sensed he'd rehearsed this moment""What do you want me to do about it?""""I want a car,"" he said.""A car."" Well, I thought, just keep your head, old cock. ""Okay. What kind of car?”""A Jaguar,"" he said.""Okay."" Now just keep your head, old cock—so what if it's a forty-five-thousand-dollar car? ""A yellow one.""""Okay, a yellow one."" Keep your head, old cock.""And I want a ribbon around it And I want you to give it to me in front of the crew.""Once again, they had to separate me from Richards. I wanted to hit him so hard he'd have to roll down his socks to take a shit I was trying, I explained, trying very hard to be nice, but he was such an asshole it was almost impossible. However, the next day I ordered his Jag, a yellow one, and apologized in front of the crew. As soon as I finished, he disappeared. Later, two Teamsters reported having seen him take a swan dive off a prop truck. After being helped up, he complained of headaches. He also couldn't see.Richards went back to LA. Production shut down until Kastner got a director to finish up a lackluster movie that nobody-neither those in it nor those who went to see it—gave two shits about.In the meantime, I received a call from noted LA. attorney Howard Weitzman, who now represented Richards. As soon as I heard Weitzman's voice, I knew Mr. Richards was going for the major bucks.""I'm a big fan,"" Weitzman said. ""But you're on the other side and we have to work this out.""My lawyers were O'Melveny & Meyers, a wonderful, staid firm. They had been handling my stuff for twenty years. The problem was, Mr. Weitzman proceeded to kick their ass. My punch ended up costing me and my insurance company $500,000. It was the costliest one-punch fight in my history. Hell, for $500,000, Tyson can have two on me! If nothing else, though, my performance both on and off the screen quashed any doubts about my physical health. That's the good news. The bad news is, I was suddenly perceived as a crazy, moody mental case. Gee, it felt good to be back in the movie business.Excerpt From:  My Life by Burt Reynolds.

60107,"Bye bye, all of EVANGELION - and good riddance.The Eva Rebuilds are pointless. They are the end product of the banal hyperfixation that all major media franchises will eventually suffer, the most extreme, self-aggrandizing, and utterly worthless endeavor that any filmmaker at Anno's caliber has ever undergone.These movies are primarily stories about Evangelion itself, about the iconography of the series and about the meaning that is constructed from the narrative building blocks that have been created  - but that alone cannot justify their existence. Evangelion is self-reflexive to it's core, and it always has been. Evangelion was self-reflexive in the very first episode, when it flipped the script on it's genre by embracing the discomfort of it's premise (and turning it's core icons of the EVAs themselves into utter monstrosities) from the get-go. Evangelion was self-reflexive in how it constantly presented the audience with discomfort and complexity at every turn, every easy joke and obvious trope being used either to dismantle the tenets of it's medium or to enrich the story it told in a way that was just plain better than those had come before - along the way, essentially rewriting the book how serialized anime narratives would be told going forwards as well. Evangelion was self-reflexive when it slid into metanarrative in the end of the series, and out of the realms of an internal reality in End of Evangelion, making the story a story not just about the characters in Evangelion, but how we process the messages they impart - and the transactional relationship between author, creation, and audience that turns this art from images and sound into a world full of life, character, and genuine purpose. There was nowhere to go when Evangelion already went everywhere, when it already told perhaps the most totally complete, self-aware, and richly realized story in all of fiction - and when you don't have anywhere to go, all you can do is go in circles.We never needed the rebuilds. We didn't need this ground to be retread, these characters and their misery and trauma to be reincarnated just to stretch out the borders of the frame, to stretch out the threads of this narrative beyond their breaking point. 3.0 is the closest these movies get to being worthwhile, because it warps all of these images (so tired and worn out as they are) into a nightmare of themselves, an apocalypse of infantile attachment for which their creation lies entirely on those who were unwilling to let go - on all those who couldn't let an ending be the end. Thrice Upon a Time is where art goes to die. It is the forced regurgitation of every meaningful image that this series has produced, so many characters and scenes and moments that I hold dear, that have genuinely formed the way I view the world, turned into a convoluted spar between action figures. All the revelations of this story are either revelations experienced 24-26 years prior, or convolutions of convolutions so absurd that they cannot be intelligible in the slightest. Technoreligious cyberbabble explains away every plot beat as quickly as they arrive, so that we can have Another Impact in another Evangelion another time, so it can rehash the boundaries of fiction and reality (but this time, with 20 years of nostalgia to muddy the waters).These characters are not characters anymore - not really. Rebuild Shinji is Sparknotes Shinji - all the core beats, but none of the flesh that makes the bones have value. Ironically, it's 3.0's plot contributions that are most interesting here, especially so far as Shinji is concerned - but even those are essentially left by the wayside in order to get us to the closing hour of the film. The rest of the cast fares far worse - they are only fleshed out so far as to either retread the original story within this new hyper-sterilized tale, or to react to the context of the original with some of the most poorly realized writing I'll ever see (Asuka especially being such a confusing and shallow mess of a character that it makes me genuinely sad knowing how rich her incarnation in EoE was). Anything that happens here has already happened before for the better, or should never have happened in the first place - and when this ridiculous fucking plot is unbound from any pathos or character (beyond the symbolic release from the symbols of Evangelion that EoE accomplished in 1997), it just makes the neverending escalation of nothingness feel infuriating to witness.The most interesting stretch of the movie was in it's opening act. For once, this world was not held hostage to all that has come before - instead of the Evangelions looking to the series's past, to a prison of memory and nostalgia, it gave us the chance to move forward with Eva, to find a place in the world among these symbols, forever loose among the world, and far beyond the control of any one person to undo. There is no release from Evangelion when this movie exists in the first place - only if the Rebuilds had never been made could this story have been properly laid to rest. Instead, these symbols became reanimated, lifeless husks of all they once were, action-figure characters telling an action-figure story in an action-figure world.I hate that I hate this movie. I hate that I can't connect with these characters, with these symbols that have so deeply shaped the very essence of who I have become. I hate that I can't find the resonance so many other people have found in this. More than anything, I simply hate the fact these were even made.Every Rebuild made is a Love and Pop or Ritual or Shin Godzilla lost. Every Rebuild made is the stagnation of Hideaki Anno as a creator - an artist who challenged himself and his audience with shockingly original stories told in shockingly original ways, plumbing the depths of the human spirit and testing the boundaries of film as a medium and art as an experience in a way nobody else ever has. Even if I did adore this film, I still would rather this project had never begun, that he had simply left Evangelion as it was, a complete work that didn't need to be ""rebuilt"" in the first place. Insisting upon Hideaki Anno, the creator of Evangelion has robbed us of Hideaki Anno, the boundary-pushing and genre-testing artist, who could flip between a guerilla camcorder story about the capital exchange of sexuality to a richly layered story about the ways that art and humanity shape each other in the span of just 2 years. The Rebuilds were always a creative dead-end, even at their best - and even if just for that reason alone, I hate that they were made.Evangelion ended on July 19, 1997. Evangelion ended with the End of Evangelion, and near-everything that this film accomplishes was done better 24 years ago. Evangelion ended with closure and completion, the resolution not just of it's story but of it's images, a story told in totality that ended in totality. Anything else is made in retrograde, because there is no point in rebuilding something that is already perfectly complete.",2,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time
52696,"""I know what gold does to men's souls."" - HowardThis was suggested by Sushami as a part of the film of the week for the Film Club. He's got exquisite taste while being a fine gentleman. His reviews are short but informative enough to generate interest. Make sure to give him a follow. He kind of deserves them. If you want to see all of the films I've watched for the Film Club, click here along with my ranking of each.Well, it's nice to know where one of the most iconic lines in film history originated from. ""Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"" I'm paraphrasing, but still.Greed. ""Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate..."" A quote that remains poignant to this film and to this day. We watch greed corrupt our party and it particularly affects the main character. We see extenuating and external circumstances beforehand change his way of thinking. It's the buildup and psychological journey that the main character specifically goes on that really hammer home the tragedy that this story is. Like Siegel said in his review, ""the real gold was the friends we made along way."" Yeah, I know that sounds like a meme or a joke, but again like Siegel said, it definitely applies here. The friendship these three build while trying to strike it rich is what they should cherish instead of the financial repercussions. They should treasure the social wealth they find instead of the physical.The black and white cinematography was good and the score was pretty good as well. The script was fantastic; it's fast-paced and the characters' back-and-forth would often feel quippy when it's clearly not. The dialogue between the characters made all of the characters feel rich. The film was funny, but more often than not, it had some pretty dark humor in there and that surprised me, especially for its time. The action was good as well. Something that really shocked was the fact that a pretty decent part at the end was completely in Spanish with no subtitles and even when I turned on the subtitles they weren't help either, so good on the film for doing that.The cast overall did a pretty great job. Tim Holt (Bob Curtin) was good. Humphrey Bogart (Fred C. Dobbs) didn't disappoint and Walter Huston (Howard) was absolutely incredible and deserving of his Best Supporting Actor win. He was really entertaining and delivered all of his lines with a lightness to them and bullet point precision. The pacing could've been better. Maybe I was just bored. Yeah, I think that's it. I took a little nap while watching it and rewinded it back to the part I fell asleep at. The fight choreography was also not that good. While the film was ahead of its time for certain elements, it also felt like it was released at the right time. The story felt like something from that period, you know what I mean?It's pretty good pick, Sushi and I'm thankful that you suggested it!

62225,"''I cooked the potatoes too long.''What's so special here? I get what it's going for—operating primarily as a critique of ingrained female behaviors causing their own unhappiness in an increasingly liberated society, the female impulse to provide (whether natural or socially inflicted) often becoming a series of involuntary petty martyrdoms; secondarily operating as a critique of the mundanity of domesticity, and the addictive but ultimately self-destructive nature of rigid daily routine—but isn't that a little bit thin for the film's over three hour runtime? And if the film's thematic content is stretched too thin by the film's runtime, then what does that runtime actually add?Past a point the mundanity is no longer reinforced by dragging scenes out for minutes at a time. Instead, the viewer disengages from the film and the film itself becomes the chore rather than the events portrayed on-screen. Beyond that, the runtime feels contrived. Three hours and twenty minutes. Long enough to be excessive and artsy, but not long enough to be truly difficult. And short enough to be shown in cinemas instead of as an exhibition in art galleries. Would the film—as it stands currently, with its 'longer runtime reinforces mundanity therefore it's more effective' ethos—not be more effectively committing to its concept by being 6 hours long? 8 hours? 12 hours? Maybe even a 24 hour piece played on a loop in art galleries?As it stands, the runtime feels like an affect. An aesthetic choice designed not to vibe with the concept, but primarily to appeal most directly to a very specific arthouse demographic. As for the rest of the film's aesthetic? It's just nothing special. I enjoy the voyeuristic. static security camera style to the directing—each room having one or two perspectives that remain unchanged throughout the film. It feels as if there are dozens of cameras set up all over the house, and we're just following Jeanne around by switching from camera to camera. I also like the unexplained flashing light in the living room.But beyond that, what's really going on here?The dialogue is bad, the outside sequences are ugly, the ending is tacky, and there's nothing else going on visually beyond the CCTV gimmick—and Akerman fails to really do anything interesting with that beyond the scene with the woman in the grocery store.And this could all potentially be fine, but the film fails to achieve the hypnotic effect achieved by many other mostly static films, so the lack of interesting aesthetic considerations is a problem.The film is also clearly not going for boredom—despite what many reviewers claim. Mundanity and boredom are not the same thing. Mundanity is seductive, subtly oppressive, but comfortable.Akerman clearly wants the viewer to be sucked in by the mundanity. The constant motion, rising intensity, and numb but incessant activity. There's an inertia pulling Jeanne along, and Akerman wants the viewer to be pulled along by it too. Calling it boring, even as a compliment, is an indictment of the film, showing that Akerman failed at what is seemingly her primary intent with regard to viewer engagement.And where is Akerman's staggeringly intricate attention to detail? It's often mentioned, but i fail to actually see it. Is it just the picture of Jeanne's husband on her bedroom desk in the film's final few minutes? Is that what passes for impressive attention to detail? Because the house is otherwise no different to any other 70s house, and no more specifically indicative of Jeanne and her deteriorating mental/emotional health than any other house would be. It's just a house. I enjoyed the way the camera explored it, but the house itself is hardly interesting.And then, further calling into question Akerman's attention to detail, there are two scenes where pieces of filming equipment (little flapping wires on boxes) are visible at the bottom of the screen, a scene where a yellow boom mic peeks in on the right hand side of the screen, and a scene in the kitchen where the boom's shadow and reflection are visible on the window and wall.These aren't little peeks either, the boom and filming equipment all remain on screen for upwards of 10 seconds each. Four seperate scenes. Not something easily missed by a filmmaker with a uniquely intense attention to detail.And this isn't even getting into the dozen or so shots that are inexplicably out of focus.Fact is, Jeanne Dielman isn't as clever, deep, or pretty as everyone claims.It's a relatively uninteresting 3h20m cinema verite piece about a woman making dinner, prostituting herself, and shopping.It's not really any different to Andy Warhol's long shots of nothing much, except it has a very loose narrative throughline.That isn't to say the film is awful—i feel like a denser film with more developed conceptual content could be interesting—only to say that I completely fail to see what makes Jeanne Dielman even close to being one of the greatest films ever made.Speaking of failing to see:I think that a good number of the people who've logged this film—often with 5 star reviews—haven't even watched it.Many of the reviews mention the now infamous scene where Jeanne drops a potato. To the point where it's something close to a meme when discussing the film. For some people it's all they know about the film.But which scene is that exactly? Because I didn't see it, and neither did my fiancée who's seen this film twice now.As far as we can tell, there is no scene where Jeanne drops a potato, and yet dozens of the top reviews—reviews hailing this film as a timeless masterpiece that they've watched again and again—mention it.But...There is no scene where Jeanne drops a potato.",2,jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles

22453,"20 minutes in, and I already knew how much I was going to hate this movie. The violence is childish, the acting overdone, and the script runs entirely on exposition, but surprisingly, none of these things are my biggest complaint. What's most despicable about this movie is its treatment of the female characters, reducing each of them to objects that are beaten, raped, and, in a particular moment of disturbing irony, physically written on. They also faint at the sight of blood and say things like ""It hurts so much. But I'll endure it"" or ""I want to make you feel good"". When the story doesn't need them, it locks them away in prisons or murders them off-screen, returning to them only when the time has come to make them the center of a clumsy, contrived plot twist. The only thing that's remotely accurate about this movie is its title, as it seems like the people who created this are nothing but a bunch of boys who, despite having aged, have completely forgotten to grow up.",0,oldboy

8799,"Morricone, bless you. Even in a movie this putrid and painfully uninspired, he managed one of the great theme tunes.Giuseppe Tornatore could have saved us from a lot of his bullshit if the kissing montage at the end was all he had, because frankly, the rest of the film is an unbelievable, badly acted piece of sentimentality porn which wears glasses so rose-tinted that anyone not in tune with his vision could mistake those roses for blood.Jesus fucking Christ, this was unbearable. Toto the kid is one of the least sympathetic kids ever, and the movie tries to cover it up because of his love of the movies. Because NOTHING in the world could possibly be more important than movies and the cinema, right? Who needs education, or discipline, or empathy, or the safety of others? Taking a random video of a random girl in public is perfectly fine, because HE LOVES MOVIES. Persistently lying to his parents, stealing from Alfredo, and doing great harm to his sister - that's all fine as well because HE LOVES MOVIES. This movie also tries to convince us that a raucous crowd-mentality, an encouragement of piracy by theatres, pollution of the streets, among other things are also somehow fine. There's a fucking scene where some dimwits in the front row are masturbating to the screen, and besides a laughably weak slap or two, the guard largely lets them off. But this is all fine too, because this is the MAGIC OF THE MOVIES(TM). This movie is just utterly delusional - it adds importance to movies and the movie-going experience, because by doing that, it adds importance to itself by proxy, as it is a movie about movies and the movie-going experience. What a lazy and horseshit anti-art approach - it comes close to the nadir of creativity. It's not a coincidence that the vast majority of the actually watchable segments in ""Cinema Paradiso"" come from footage of the older movies themselves. Even in their shortened form, they still exhibit more creativity, wit and soul than this.This film abuses nostalgia in the worst possible way because aside from the final sequence (in which Morricone does so much of the heavy-lifting), Tornatore brings nothing interesting to the table. His directorial decisions are baffling to say the least. The army scene isn't long enough, the waiting outside the window has only a thread-bare relationship with the story Alfredo tells, and some scenes are so fucking corny that I can't tell if it's meant to be reality or a badly put together fantasy sequence. The atrocious writing doesn't help with matters, either. Perhaps some of this is remedied in the extended versions (I saw the two hour cut), but frankly, I don't want to put myself through this again. It felt like the 172 minute cut while watching it.I'd be more forgiving of this film if it were either a) better written, or b) not so reliant on the classic movies shown. It doesn't say anything about those older movies because so much of ""Cinema Paradiso"" is reaction shots of badly behaved theatre goers (ironically, while trying to advertise the magic of the movies, this film exposes everything that is wrong with theatres and theatre audiences). Seriously, large sections of this movie are an extended THEATRE-GOERS POST-WWII REACT TO OLD MOVIES skit which is extremely painful to watch due to just how little cinema etiquette is demonstrated. And yet the movie appears just fine with it. Because it's the MAGIC OF THE MOVIES(TM). I love the cinema, but get fucking real.",1,cinema-paradiso

32805,"""Hey dan i really want to get into movies. Where should i start?""""Oh, you should definitely check out some of Andrei Tarkovski's filmography. He's a brilliant filmmaker that should be a great start for any of new cinephiles. His best work is mirror. You should definitely check that out i highly recommend it""""Oh cool okay thanks 👍""""😈""Mirror is a very personal film about memories, thoughts, and surrealism, that was also a semi-autobiography of Tarkovsky himself. The film conveys the parallel lives of a Father and Son, who are both the victims of lost-childhood. The film is narrated in a very original format, a dream suddenly intercuts the reality and vanishes without any indication. And as usual Tarkovski added some poetic narratives that is already being his trademark in most of his filmsFrom what i see, this is a type of an experimental film, that film can be use as a form of medium to express anything the artist wants to express & turned them into a beautiful work of art. When watching some of Tarkovski's films, you don't think rationally to comprehend some of the sequences, you just got to let it flow to understand the beauty of Tarkovski's filmography. And here's what i feel when watching mirror: 🗿Tbh, i find it hard to rate some of Tarkovski's filmography. So i always gave him 4 ⭐ because it's at least the most respectful rating i could give to him. After watching 3 films of his, i think it's safe to say that Andrei Rublev is my personal best from his because the story is not really complex as this & stalker.

39507,"Still Walking probably is the most relatable Koreeda film (imo) for everyone knows Asian parents and grandparents are quite hard to deal with sometimes. (every single film this man made is relatable, so that says a lot)What's quite distinctive with Still Walking is that it made me quite miffed at it's main characters (a rarity for a Koreeda film) one moment and the very next moment made me sympathise with the grief they carry with them. I don't know if this makes sense but except the kids and may be Ryo's wife(to an extent) none of the characters felt loveable to me, yet I could relate to their emotions. I've seen and heard people like them around me. There's no ideal protagonist here. Every character is a mix of what it means to be flawed, selfish, judgemental, a little regressive and that's some clever writing. For every opinion that bothered me, someone had a counter-opinion that calmed me.  Koreeda is so nuanced as he deals with a tampered parent-child relationship, loss of a child, ageing, generation gap et. al and I love him for that.

88391,"I had extensive conversations with friends about the recent changes on Letterboxd, and they helped further formulate my thoughts on the Spider-Verse movie(s). It's understandable to address and appropriately handle the orchestrated, inflammatory ratings that were driven by fandoms or reactionary sentiments, but it appears that the changes aim to reconfigure the top films list into a film canon that replicates and caters closer, although marginally, to the general consensus of those who possess cinephilic sensibilities. It reinforces the homogenized film taste that said consensus is largely informed by; much of the acumen and authority of globalized cinephilia is already influenced by a predominantly ""white"" and male film culture in both their demographic and the development of their ""tastes."" It doesn't help when we don't exactly know how these ratings are now being calculated, considered, or accounted for. Not that the list is significantly different from before, but devaluing the scores from Letterboxd members only because of the region they belong to (i.e. global south) would result in lowering the scores of the prominent films from those regions, only making the list more exclusionary and, therefore, less interesting. Of course, one has to wonder how Letterboxd tries to be ""responsible"" to ensure that the weighted rating continues to be accurate and ""fit-for-purpose."" How are the changes designed to mitigate against the scenario of a film being beloved in one ""region?"" How do they define a ""region?"" And why does this, in particular, require mitigation? Letterboxd itself recognizes that the community has exponentially grown and expanded far more than initially expected, so it's also important to realize that any given consensus would significantly change from a diversified and expanded voting pool. And the list itself is dynamic, always a snapshot of the times at those times, and never representative of the times to come until they arrive. It should not be the same 250 films or the same rankings across multiple decades, even years. But canons, for any given time or place, are useful for a variety of reasons, especially for an individual's access to and personal development of their own ""canons,"" their favorites. Though it's important to recognize the manner in which works are judged, praised, and compiled for a canon, and how said canon functions, forms, and fulfills particular roles for a culture and a history. Therefore, challenging canons can be as important, as useful, and even as rewarding as creating ""canons,"" personal or otherwise, as all of them demand the humility to open themselves for change and difference. Yet the various forces involved with the canonization of films have been profoundly shaped by the current post-cinematic media landscape, where everything is digital, interactive, networked, mobile, processual, algorithmic, or aggregative. Everyone and everything is capable of accessing and processing more data than ever before, but that also includes corporations. The aforementioned post-cinematic media landscape is contemporary in that it occupies a position of an ongoing, uneven, and, in some sense, an indeterminate historical transition, and yet what is absolutely certain in the current organization of the (American) culture industries is the profit motive behind accessing, processing, and recycling ""content."" Enough replication of a ""content"" would result in the augmentation of its own ""canon.""Corporations, undoubtedly, are provided with or given access to data on what is trending, on what is generating engagement or attention, or on what ensures certain financial guarantees. Such structured information or accumulation of data has been previewed, packaged, prepared, or processed by the measurements and modelings conducted by media or data analysts, the information gathering and business strategizing by the market researchers, and the consolidating of ownership rights by the intellectual property lawyers, as they pledge their loyalties to said corporations in securing access to content belonging to a ""canon"" the corporations ""own."" Corporations, thus, not only have greater access to (private) databases but also the toolkits for approximating the best product for mass consumption. And in the current post-cinematic media landscape, the way in which content creation shapes consumer behavior is almost if not as important as the way consumer behavior shapes content creation. How does a consumer respond to a given content or the contents within the content? What does the consumer experience when they engage with content? Are there expectations the consumer develops that future content can ""satisfy"" to boost engagement? Of course, corporations understand that consumers are aware of the ideas associated with the production of content within the current media landscape, even if they don't fully grasp the entire scope of production or a specific level of one. In response, content will also contain content that encourages consumers to form more concrete ideas on the production of content itself. Regardless, all of the consumer's behavior towards content will be stored and later studied for the creation of future content that maximizes engagement further, all for the sake of making more money. Considering the sophistication of the productive forces, institutions, databases, property rights, technologies, and studios that are collaboratively owned by Columbia Pictures, Sony, and Marvel, transmedial movies like the Spider-Verse are expected to exist to not only generate revenue but also reinforce its content ""canon"" as a means to secure cultural and financial relevancy (hegemony). It's also expected of Spider-Verse to further develop its relevancy in the further development of not only its multiverse conceit but also the Lord and Miller specialty of industrial metacommentary.The combined inclusion of multiverse plotting and metacinematic devices is enough to suggest that the movie is not just informing its viewers that they are watching a work of fiction but also disclosing how much of its storytelling is informed by its awareness of the viewer's knowledge of Spider-Man's position within pop-culture canon, history, and iconography. The movie knows it's a movie, but it also knows that viewers may know that the movie knows. This would encourage viewers to recognize not just the text or the subtext but also the metatext. But the movie is intellectually and emotionally dishonest with the metacinematic multiverse apparatus because it develops an interpretive direction that operates under flawed presumptions.Consider the scene involving Gwen encountering the Italian Renaissance-themed Vulture inside the Guggenheim. Upon observing the works of Jeff Koons (a real-life fraud and a real-life caricature of the ""art world""), The Vulture questions if they qualify as ""art,"" to which Gwen responds by saying, ""We're talking about it, aren't we?"" The Vulture, then, slices the head of the infamous Balloon Dog (which Koons once declared, with a nebulous description, that it symbolizes ""human experience""), toppling over and spilling out hundreds of smaller Balloon Dogs. Gwen, then, adds that ""it's more of a metacommentary on what we call art... but it's also art."" Like all superheroes, Spider-Man possesses a history of thoroughly moderating popular reaction to approve of any semblance of exceptional interventionism with extraordinary authority, all for the purported sake of protecting and preserving universal order. The universal appeal of Spider-Man, however, is that anyone can be a Spider-Man, but what are the implications of this message if one were to consider the iconography, history, and mythology of Spider-Man and all of its representational forms? What are their relations to the ideas and images they facilitate in Spider-Verse? What does it mean when Gwen tells her father that he is a ""good cop,"" and that if he didn't take the badge, someone who shouldn't will? Finally, what does it mean when Gwen refers to her mask as her ""badge?""If The Vulture is meant to represent an older era of art, art history, or art criticism, then Gwen's response questions the content and legitimacy of historical canons, suggesting that the works of Jeff Koons could exist as art and belong in a canon. But ""art,"" along with ""canon,"" is a descriptor that remains largely neutral and nebulous without context. It's important to question the content within existing canons, as what is excluded or omitted from a canon is presumed to have failed at meeting the rules for qualifying. But the rules, or the canon itself, can be flawed, though oftentimes, the works could dilute the ""quality"" of what canons are believed to represent. All of this suggests that the concerns for canonicity are far less about canonical exclusion but more on recognizing why canons emerge, as they oftentimes emerge not for the sake of maintaining standards of merits but mostly from fulfilling the needs of specific groups by whom and for whom canons are formed. This is why representation should matter, but how it challenges notions of ""art"" and ""canons,"" along with how the representational politics facilitate such a challenge, matters more.It's more accurate to suggest that Gwen isn't really challenging The Vulture for questioning the legitimacy of Koons' work as ""art."" Rather, Gwen is defending and, thus, protecting the laissez-faire attitude towards art and canons. This, ultimately, is vulnerable to surrendering itself to the coercion, exploitation, and violence behind producing the inequitable outcomes and unequal exchanges in not just the production of ""art"" but also its ""canonization."" There is a reason why globalized cinephilia is profoundly influenced by a predominantly ""white"" culture. There is a reason why Koons' work is valued so greatly (there's also money laundering involved in the art world, but there's no need to go over that). There is a reason why Gwen defends the property of Jeff Koons to exist in the ""art world.""With all of this in mind, especially given the metacinematic multiverse apparatus, it would be fair to assume that Spider-Verse wants to posit the following: 1) Spider-Verse is art because anything can be art and 2) Spider-Verse can challenge and, perhaps, belong in a canon, or that it can create its own. One could argue that no one or nothing possesses the special right to establish ""canons,"" but there are specializations and disciplines to discriminate among art, as this is all inevitably a matter of power and politics. Therefore, there is a particular obligation to correct or challenge not just a canon but also an art that either belongs to or wishes to belong to a canon; however, a correction or challenge from one individual--whether they're a specialist or an ordinary admirer of an art--may not necessarily be what it is for another. Though the disagreement in their interpretation of art (or canons) is rooted in their evaluation of what qualifies for being ""honest"" or, rather, what provides clarity--an extended understanding--to the position that is representative of being ""honest.""What makes Spider-Verse dishonest ""art,""  however, is that its metacinematic multiverse apparatus--given the material conditions that led to the movie's creation--is never intended to ask the right questions about ""art"" or ""canons."" Instead, it utilizes exhaustive measures to workshop and optimize the recognizability and familiarity of content that has been subsumed on the basis of its trending history in a post-cinematic media landscape. If mainstream superhero films were already meticulous arrangments of intellectual property, then it shouldn't come as a surprise for a transmedial movie like Spider-Verse to reprocess the aesthetic, stylistic, political, or ideational content that, in their digitized forms of keywords or ""images,"" possess enough of a digital footprint such that conversations (content) will generate and enable corporations to study this consumer feedback and store their findings for future content production. Content is arranged such that they functionally serve only as stimuli that reinforce the nebulousness of the central story's declarations of ""challenging canons"" without ever asking the right questions regarding how canons are determined, how they're challenged, and for whom and for what do these challenges matter. Miles asking ""Who decides that?"" is not sufficient to qualify as the ""right question"" because he is asking to participate in either becoming accepted into a flawed Spider-Man canon or on the mission to create his own canon that would replicate the false mythologies of the Spider-Man canon, as it would only serve to ""correct"" the mythologies without ever radically challenging them, because otherwise, there would be no mainstream Spider-Man project.If Spider-Verse embodies what ""transmedia"" represents in a cinematic format (in reference to the interaction between different forms of media and the manner in which they lead to content convergence and the transfer of content of one form of media to another), then it shouldn't come as a surprise that the movie has been profoundly influenced by the mechanisms of Internet and Internet culture, where content proliferation lends itself to any given media's toolkit for recognition (search) optimization. For a movie that claims to confront ""canons,"" the contradictions emerging from the aforementioned arrangement of content ""keywords"" such as ""antagonizing fascists,"" ""political action,"" ""self-mythologizing,"" ""a metaphor for capitalism,"" ""anarchist,"" and ""Rest in Power"" are only symptomatic of a corporation's singular goal of maximizing engagement. The contradictions, of course, mostly arise from the subtext associated with Spider-Man's history of mythologizing the heroism of the American police, built upon a culture and inheritance of institutional violence that fundamentally opposes many of the ""content"" the movie incorporates. Of course, resigning from the police force won't ""fix"" the system if 1) the police still exist and 2) the canonical structure of the superhero police analog is reliant on rescuing or ""replicating"" the false heroism of the police.But because the multiverse conceit relies on the metacommentary device of the Lord and Miller trademark, it invites viewers to exhaust the textual, subtextual, and metatextual interpretations of the various elements within Spider-Verse's content, which in and of itself is content for future use. Yet the insidiousness of the metacinematic multiverse apparatus is the storytelling and aesthetic mechanisms built for anticipating any form of content interpretation. Spider-Verse contains such contradictions because the self-awareness implied by the metacommentary exists to ""reflect"" but deflect critique; the dramatic, thematic, and emotional orientation of the movie's content is one where it can appeal to any individual's already existing sensibilities and disposition. Whatever critique develops can and will be stored to apply a more sophisticated corrective approach to Beyond to, again, refine its mainstream appeal and reinforce its content canon. Such a canon is more concerned with the engagement of the viewer than the mode of engagement that should take place, never concerned with truly challenging canons because such efforts will contradict their mission to appeal to as many viewers as possible.Canonizations are processes involving multiple participants that collaborate but ultimately compete with each other, an incredible dynamism that is vulnerable to surrendering itself to the codes established by a singular institution. If a highly corporatized product, one that only exists to anticipate and react to consumer feedback, could be allowed to exist in a canon, what does that say about the canon itself? If such a corporatized product wants to declare itself as ""art"" only on the basis of the volume of consumer feedback it generates, what does that say about the definition of ""art"" being used?TO BE CONTINUED...",1,spider-man-across-the-spider-verse

22116,"Sergio Leone is the king of Western and “Once Upon a Time in the West” is without a doubt another timeless classic from the master director. It starts with one of the coolest and most iconic opening scenes of all time and what follows is a film full of more iconic scenes. This has to be one of the most stylish and beautiful looking movies I have ever seen. Every shot looks cool as fuck. Now also add an engaging story, four fascinating characters, and Ennio Morricone’s legendary score, and you have a near perfect masterpiece. The movie is 166 minutes long and I wasn´t bored for a second.People often debate, which one is the better movie: “Once Upon a Time in the West” or “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”? I am undecided. On the one hand, I think that “Once Upon a Time in the West” is even more stylish and better crafted, and I like the score a bit more (though the score is perfect in both movies). On the other hand, I find the characters and story of “The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly” a bit more interesting. I guess that means it is more or less a draw. What I know for sure is that both movies are masterpieces that I will revisit a lot in the future.",8,once-upon-a-time-in-the-west
52240,"So thus came the day when two young Danish filmmakers Thomas Vinterberg and Lars von Trier, along with a few collaborators/followers, sat down and said:SO YOU SHALL NOT: - The shooting should be on location, props and sets must not be brought in;- The sound must never be produced apart from the image or vice versa;- The camera must be hand held;- Must be in color, special lighting will not be acceptable;- Optical and filters are forbidden;- No superficial action like murders or weapons;- Temporal or geographical alienation are forbidden;- No genre movies;- The format must be 35mm;- The director must not be credited; And so the Dogma 95 was born…A movement working under the philosophy of “Less is more” to let filmmakers surrounded with challenges of limitations to let them struggle hard so they can reach an explore their own power of creativity, so they could get away from the gimmicks of Hollywood filmmaking that was infesting the world.Well they do made it look that way at first in here it’s first Dogma film, The Celebration, especially in how crude and dry the style is presented with its parched visual and the camera being placed like a modern found footage gimmick, with everything seemingly being shot by a 5 dollar camera you could purchase on a gift shop, selling that extremely naturalistic realism.But when you look closely as The Celebration unravels itself, this is a pretty well written theatrical narrative, played as a farce and with heavy undertones of melodrama, and packs a STELLAR cast of what the best of Danish cinema could deliver. So by the first Dogma 95 film, it just immediately sabotages its own established rules from the get go, that on itself already looked more like a provocative style than anything in the first place – nothing out of the unexpected coming from Trier. Though none of that really matters when the overall result really goes beyond any established rule in dogma’s doctrines and Vinterberg’s The Celebration stands far taller as a pretty irreverent comedy that is both hilarious as uncomfortably dark, while carried with a surprising amount of heart, and so its 100 minutes becomes an entire experience that you get yourself glued the screen just to see how far its ridiculousness and self-mockery of its somber line of drama will go.It starts out pretty funny already, immediately working as a messy version of a slapstick comedy of manners that is dripping in irony and dark undertones that keep everything so deliciously engaging in its sharp precise interactions and remarks that reveal all the trivial characteristics of the crowd of characters running loose in the environment and letting us know exactly who will be the main players among the three brothers and the father, looming like a shadow above everyone even when he’s absent of the screen.But right after the dinner starts and the big mike is dropped, cards are thrown in the table in a major reveal underneath all the perfectly quirky family, and the thing becomes even more darkly hilarious as hugely gloomy in its eccentricities, carried by a complete feel of embarrassment and awkward tension running throughout every character, sometimes to hugely uncomfortable degree, but never less engaging as it constantly remarks the real feelings at play of the situations, emoting from the characters in palpable reactions that fell just too real, that even makes you question slightly if this isn’t some documentary footage.Helped by that hand held and low color grading looking like it was shot in an old Polaroid and makes the film almost look like stocked footage from an old family video,  which hence gives the film’s intent of exploring dirty secrets being exposed all the more clear. Vinterberg and editor Valdís Óskarsdóttir bounces between the characters with a heavy kineticsm that never loses track of the main action, and yes it increases the level of anxiety that is shared by all characters.Thomas Bo Larsen steals the scene as the scoundrel brother that wants to make a good pose next to his father just to hide how much of a miserable looser and disgusting womanizer he is, Paprika Steen hides a immense a lot of pain under her more free-minded drunk behavior but she has a heart well cleared out during the film, and Ulrich Thomsen carries the center of the film with an ambivalent demented honesty amidst a nest of lies and hypocrisies of which he just feels suffocated to be around.Unraveling through the big conservative family system picture that gets undressed on stage and reveal all its ingrained prejudices, power plays within the family, and lots of physical and emotional abuse imploding left and right, and most of the family just turning a blindfold over them whose ambivalence is played for the uncomfortable laughs, and Vinterberg brilliantly exudes the unhinged level of absurdity present in the humanly real.When Thomsen’s character brings the big bombshell involving the family patriarch, and most of the family just takes it as a bad taste joke throwed by a drunk needy individual, and where the only people that helps and believes him are literally the staff members preventing everyone from leaving the house and staying to confront the shit throwed in the fan – some take it as a read of allegory of censorship against a hard truth to be accepted whiting the patriarchy established peace, and that antecedes a lot of the discussions that run through today in the me-too movements of opening against an inflicted abuse no matter how much shit the world is willing to throw back at your truth refusing to be accepted.But it's so good and commendable that the film just doesn’t take itself upon just this or other factors that may arouse political innuendos because it never becomes any preachy with those layers, instead, what you got in The Celebration reveals a human and sincere dramatic study between laughter and disturbing facts, people like us that are capable of affection and abuse, as we are all in the same bag of tendencies that our own desires arouse and we are the ones who choose where to take them. And if one goes beyond unimaginable limits, it results in trauma and abuse capable of harming and poisoning a soul, and in this veiled truth being exposed on its naked face, it is the strength that cinema is able to reveal when the efforts to such are high to achieve. So in a way, the Dogma really had its effect after all!And even after all of that, the film actually ends on a surprising touching note simply because Vitemberg has some real heart and treats all its characters, even the most despicable ones, as flawed humans facing their own nature, and play everything as this ridiculous comedy, and it works in all those levels. It’s not polished nor fully well realized through its drama – a lot of the main climax points take abrupt turns, but the overall execution and the formidable acting, just makes it an unforgettable and strong experience to sit through. A must watch indeed!",8,the-celebration

44629,"At any given mid-level film festival, audiences are almost guaranteed to come across a very particular brand of familiar ""festival film"". A slow, ""simple"" film with sparse narrative, usually set in some ""exotic"" (i.e. non-American/Western European) location, about the everyday lives of ""common"" (read: poor) people, full of ""lyrical"" and ""naturalistic"" cinematography and relatively little dialogue. The film's protagonist will more often than not be a child, through whom the audience can observe with ""innocent wonder"" the simple, rural lives of these people. Critics will invariably praise the film for it's ""warmth"" and ""humanism"", and almost as inevitably the film will be pleasantly unremarkable and largely forgettable. Even more so than the work of Yasujiro Ozu (more or less the patron saint of this style of minimalistic ""humanist"" cinema), Satyajit Ray's Pather Panchali plays like the template for this entire all-too-familiar brand of ""respectable"" art house cinema, for better or worse. All the aforementioned hallmarks are here, and while the film probably deserves credit for spawning so much acclaimed international filmmaking, this type of ""humanistic"" neorealism almost never fails to underwhelm me. I found myself often bored with this, for many of the same exact reasons that I've never cottoned much to Ozu's work, or De Sica's, or Kiaorostami's, or Naomi Kawase's, Victor Erice's Spirit of the Beehive, Tran Anh-Hung's Scent of Green Papaya or even Charles Burnett's Killer of Sheep to name just a few prominent and well-loved examples (all of which surely have some of Ray's film in their cinematic DNA).I worry that any criticism of this film runs the risk of sounding like Francois Truffaut's infamously unenlightened response that he ""didn't want to see a movie of peasants eating with their hands"" (just imagine the shit storm of social media outrage his remark would have been greeted with today, had he been writing for, say, The A.V. Club). And yet, while watching the film my mind did return yet again to Orson Welles' famous quote ""I know that directors find serious and sensitive audiences for films where people sit around peeling potatoes in the peasant houses."" I, too, know that there are people who thrill to this type of naturalistic ""humanism"", but at this point in time I simply cannot bring myself to give a shit, as essentially well-executed as the film may be.I hadn't seen one of Ray's films in a long time, but I've actually seen a number of his '60s films back when they were streaming on Netflix  in horrendous quality. At the time, they struck me as a somewhat cruder and less sophisticated counterpoint to the innovations and trends happening in European art films of the period (so shamefully Eurocentric of me, I know, I know). And while nothing here feels as clumsy as the symbolism in a film like Nayak, I didn't actually find Pather Panchali to be an improvement over those films, even with Criterion's impressive restoration. The newly crisp visual quality certainly helps somewhat, but I still don't find in Ray the same level of formal innovation that makes Ozu's like-minded work (just barely) more engaging. Sure there's some nice ""lyrical"" imagery of nature, but Ray doesn't show any particular aptitude for how he shoots things (aside from a somewhat bewilderingly disjointed sense of spacial continuity). He seems to use the camera mostly as a recording device.For what is ostensibly the first installment of the so-called ""Apu Trilogy"", I found it rather remarkable how little Apu actually does in the film, beyond looking at things with wide-eyed ""innocence"" or whatever. Not that he's particularly terrible or precious as far a child actors go, rather he doesn't actually serve much purpose in the film's overall narrative. With Apu's role more or less reduced to looking ""cute"", and the Auntie's to being ""endearingly"" crotchety (or something), the film is ultimately more than anything about the relationship between the daughter, Durga, and their mother (the father spends most of the film away from home for inexplicably long periods of time). Although, as studiedly understated as the film is, the ""story"" doesn't really matter a lot of the time. That is, until someone dies, something that I thought Ray handles... awkwardly, if not exactly embarrassingly. More than anything, it just feels a bit tonally off that the film so largely undramatic should occasionally fall back on some pretty generic melodramatic tropes at times.I don't want to imply that Western audiences only lavish praise on Ray's film due to some sense of ""white guilt"", but I do have to wonder how much a certain knee-jerk liberal impulse does kick in when confronted with a film concerning third-world poverty. Is it okay to admit that you find films like this dull and boring? Again, I'm sure there are people who genuinely respond to the gentle, low-key ""warmth"" that these films are generally touted as possessing, but does that really account for how unanimously this film has become canonized? Of course, like I said above I feel pretty much the same way about Ozu's films, or Italian Neo-Realism, so one should probably take what I say here with a grain of salt. Maybe I am just a cold, unfeeling, and obliviously privileged white American dude who can't appreciate the subtle poetry of rural Indian life on display here. I dunno.Anyway, I guess I'll just be over here enjoying a movie about upper-class white people reciting clever, funny dialogue. Never mind me.Rating: 40/100",3,pather-panchali

35639,"Should I be moved by a father who forces his daughter into an arranged marriage and calls it a sacrifice? I know this is ""sign of the time"", but there is a reason why Japan is still one of the most misogynistic countries among the supposed developed countries, despite its rather early onset of feminist movements, one of which happened merely two years before the release of Late Spring.Similar to the equally maddening Only Yesterday, it's not necessarily the misogynistic tendencies, but the directorial choices that rub one the wrong way. In Only Yesterday, the female protagonist, despite an unhappy, semi-abusive upbringing and toxic family, ""happily"" rejoins home. In Late Spring, the case isn't as extreme, but it's nonetheless a story built on the same tradition that exploits women. Putting aside the fact that the father bosses his daughter around like a maid, the story heavily relies on the arranged marriage plot device to emotionally speak to the audience, and paint the father as a saint despite his decaying idea that a woman could not enjoy happiness without marriage, even an arranged one.Setsuko Hara is for me the saving grace of this highly misguided production. Unlike Tokyo Story which depicts sentiments that are both timeless and universal, Late Spring is no more than an ill-informed documentation of an ugly facet of the past, and the present, that should've been eliminated long ago.",4,late-spring
56644,"Silent cinema is an admitted weak spot in my film-watching experience, I haven’t seen much of it at all. My knowledge of it doesn’t extend beyond my schooling and higher education days, where I watched one Chaplin film for Year 10 English class (I don’t remember which one it was though), and the standard silent cinema they treat you to as a film student at university (Buster Keaton films, A Trip To The Moon, Meshes of the Afternoon, etc. as just a few I can think of off the top of my head). I always remember liking what I saw, but never really going beyond what was expected of us to see as a student, or exploring more of what is essentially the birth of the medium that I love so much. I really appreciated finally seeing another silent-era film, even if it was just me watching it for the film club weekly pick. It’s always something I’ve realised I need to explore more of, so consider my interest piqued! There is a lot to unpack in Modern Times, from the commentary on the Great Depression, to the political undertones, and Chaplin still managed to shed light on such heavy issues with his signature slapstick comedy. I also got an impression, in some instances, of the film being an implied comparison between the silent-era and the talkies, with some sequences perhaps alluding to a reluctance to move on with the “modern times.” We get small glimpses of sound effects and voices, and Chaplin’s singing performance, but often it is implied that silent film can still very much tell a story better than a sound film can. I really liked this one, rather than just simply appreciating it, which is something I think I often did with my experience with silent film (appreciation vs. enjoyment are two very different things). It’s definitely inspired me to give more of a chance to this era of film, and I absolutely hope to see more of it.",7,modern-times

Additionally, one of my favourite parts of it is Al Pacino’s performance as Michael so I was even more excited to watch the sequel as there’d be more of a focus on him.In the end, I can’t say exactly what I was expecting but I can say I was nowhere near as engaged as I was in the first and it produced none of the shock or emotions in me like the first did.Maybe I just wasn’t in the mood but yeah, long story short, I was kinda disappointed by this. Still hold the opinion that Apocalypse Now is a better film than either of these.Also guys, completely unrelated question about Twin Peaks, would it make sense for me to start with Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me or is that like a sequel?

69785,"Exhibit #168 as to why I am so different from everybody else in the world. For the life of me, I cannot friggin’ understand why people prefer, or even like, the 1972 glacier-paced and deliberately wallowing just to wallow in pain Andrei Tarkovsky Solaris over the heady and subtext-literate Steven Soderbergh 2002 remake.He was a pseudo-intellectual nut when Tarkovsky said Kubricks “2001: A Space Odyssey” lacked emotional depth in favor of technological invention, per the reason why he wanted to make his own sci-fi. So basically, put in more humans that jabber on nonsensically and pontificate incessantly. That was Tarkovsky’s way of putting a human face on sci-fi, per evidence.The very long prologue of Tarkovsky’s Solaris does indeed do that. I suppose he thought it was super to put in a bunch of wonky scientists to vaguely discuss a team of disturbed scientists and a planet that cannot be explained by basic physics. That’s prologue. When we finally get to a secondary cast member as a scientist driving his car down endless Russian highways, I was lost, because I drifted out and had come back and was unsure what was happening and why Tarkovsky was showing us this.Anyway, caught up to speed again when psychologist Kelvin (Donatas Bonionis) journeys to space and comes aboard the spaceship to make contact with the lost scientists. (It is a very unsatisfying space travel scene, done with arty special effects. If you like arty special effects, then cool for you.)Kelvin succumbs to the same hallucinatory effects as the others were. With him, manifestations of his dead wife (Natalya Bondarchuk as Hari) come back, and she’s a self-destructive, self-loathing, self-doubting manifestation. Or is she real? Well, she gets more “real” with each resurrection.And…..and….and….the movie lost me again when Kelvin and Hari have emotional encounters with each other again. Why is it so bothersome to me? Because it’s so heavy on the ennui. It’s all pain and despair and wallowing in failure and you don’t love me for this and you don’t love me for that and when are you going to love me—all of it done in that heavy art film kind of ponderousness. All pretentious heavy dialogue, and all these abstractions on topics of marriage and love, I mean goddamn! Is all this really saying anything honest about the human condition? I know dysfunctional married people, they don’t talk this way. I don’t think they ever did. Yes, I’m aware there is a limitation of how human Hari is, anyway. Still, why does she talk like such a typical ponderous art film from that late 60’s and 70’s period? Perhaps because this is a typical ponderous art film from that period.We get to the dreamlike and surreal conclusion, done with such woozy and fantastical visual design (so okay, the film does have its remarkable images), all of it pregnant with symbolism. But to me it’s ersatz symbolism. Doesn’t mean much.",3,solaris

78999,"“I detest cheap sentiment” — Margo ChanningMaybe I’m a black-hearted monster, but I kind of hated every minute of this. So much so that I’m actually mad at Criterion for working so hard to save this rare McCarey misfire from the obscurity it so totally deserves. Mawkish and moralizing, it asks us to feel sorry for a couple of doddering milksops who, at 70, have apparently given up completely on life and each other. Their kids are even worse, but the fact that the two leads, played with grating petulance by Beulah Bondi and Victor Moore, have so little fight left in them that they just resign themselves to abandoning their fifty year marriage (because, apparently, the husband was too lazy or proud to accept the caretaker position his menschy friend offered him) does not inspire a load of sympathy. In fact, by the time this film limped to its wan, dispiriting conclusion, I started to wonder if McCarey wasn’t actually trying to leave us with contempt for this pack of feckless sad sacks.",2,make-way-for-tomorrow
48949,"How difficult it is to talk about Raise the Red Lantern because it is at once a film that's so clearly about the patriarchal oppression of women in many modes of living, a stark yet honest demonstration of how systems that pit women against women serve to both profit off of and delude those they subjugate. Of how adherence to order and enthusiasm to please are natural human compulsions that can be manipulated and abused. Mistresses, lovers, courtesans and concubines, they exist in a state of constant competition and artificial scarcity for the sole benefit of the master.These same things can also be said of capitalistic systems as well, in how a tiny fraction of a fraction of the world owns more wealth and resources than the rest, in how the majority of people must compete against each other to survive, in how denial of the system is more difficult than adhering to it. It's not hard to read the mistresses as a stand-in for how the un-wealthy interact and vie for the interests of those above.""Good or bad, it's all playacting. If you act well, you can fool other people; if you do it badly, you can only fool yourself, and when you can't even fool yourself, you just can fool the ghosts.""But at the same time I don't want to rob Red Lantern of its critical female perspective into constructed misogyny.

2897,"2018 Horror x 52 ChallengeTask 39. Creature FeatureProgress: 6/52This is a pretty solid B-level creature feature type film, so as long as you're expecting that, you should be entertained. It's the type of film that spells ""director"" as ""DIrector"" in the credits and gives zero F's because who needs editing? You can tell it's a dystopian movie because the costumer raided their local Goodwill. Honestly I'm kinda surprised MST3K never got hold of this one, but there are just so many bad movies out there in the sci-fi genre that they probably just ran out of time. The acting is really poor, and my guess is most people tune to this since it was one of Demi Moore's earlier efforts. Spoiler alert - she's not good, although if you've seen her later movies you'd already know that.The characters are all pretty bland, although there is a black guy with a pretty sweet ponytail and runs the local tavern, which serves canned fruit, canned beer, and canned soup. Oh and today they have fresh lemonade. I guess lemons are scarce, which does make sense because I don't think the desert is typically a very hospitable gardening area.The special effects are awesome, and by that I mean they are not good but they are super fun in all their bloody, gooey majesty. Also when Demi Moore's character gets some blood on her face it looks like she was learning how to apply lipstick for the first time, and failing badly. The parasites are alright looking, but not as cool as I was hoping. But the real disappointment is that they didn't take front stage - instead we get too much time dealing with the other characters.So hey, for an 85 minute schlockfest from the 80s, really a pretty fun time. Definitely the type of movie you can have on while you're doing other things, but try to pay attention anytime the parasites are on screen at least!",4,parasite

69886,"we reach a specific age in our lives where everyone scrambles in a panic. suddenly people apply for life insurances, make investments, set aside for retirement. some bind themselves to mortgages, some to marriages. all at once, it's all they can babble about, at times even laced with schadenfreude, other times just with enough condescension. they race each other to a so-called milestone after milestone, while a few—with little to no opportunities, no ounce of luck—do nothing but age; day after day from 9 to 5 working at a desk, reporting to incompetent bosses, living from paycheque to paycheque. in a blink of forty years, society turns a blind eye on their liver-spotted, stooped, geriatric existence.Umberto D. despairs and frightens with such a harrowing (non) future. the inescapably cruel repercussions of old-age income poverty bring the threat of homelessness and the possibility of losing one's sole raison d'être (here it’s the love and companionship of a dog). these misfortunes are not in any way caused by idleness, vice, nor lack of drive but the insufficient pension and unavailable financial aid from the government; the apathy of vile, heartless lessors. at its height of desperation, we see a fumble with pride over the crippling state of hunger, of sickness; we also see the appeal of a different end. society continues to stare, to judge, only for it to look away as if it didn't see anything in the first place. how easily discardable people are when their contributions and usefulness to the flawed economical systems of society are over. how unknowingly immediate and almost expected unfairness is to people who belong in the lower classes.it is seldom for a film to realistically rattle me with the anxiety and uncertainty of ageing then scratch me with the retirement years worry. I think we already do enough of that in our bedrooms during sleepless nights and listless days. it seems the more we ignore the future, the quicker it arrives. this avoidance stops with Umberto D. one verse of the future is here. however, its tedious wanderings of displacement are not only its drawbacks. its edges also trace that of de Sica's other film, perhaps his magnum opus, Bicycle Thieves. the similarities are discernible. hence the depth the film aims to engulf itself in its denouement, together with its familiar tears, familiar expressions, becomes a mild, weak, almost ineffective strafe of emotions. but this verse is inevitably effectual. sometimes, it seems the only currency of our worth is the work we do.I don't know what I'm worth though. I don't even know how I will get old. how about you? are you certain of any of this? don’t answer. let’s go back to the comforts of our avoidance for now.",6,umberto-d

43731,"I will start by expressing my adoration for Tolstoy's original novel. It's realistic and intimate characters, musings on history and sociology, and philosophies on life and death are something so intensely characteristic to Russian literature that I was obviously skeptical as to how such a cultural behemoth could be cinematically conveyed. Nevertheless, I was looking forward to seeing if it could be done.Well, it succeeded at translating the skeletal structure of the novel - the general plot points and characters were all there - but failed when it left out quite possibly everything that makes War and Peace the romantic exploration of love, honour, and purpose that it is. The relationship between Prince Andrey and Natasha was half-baked and emotionally void - bar maybe Andrey's death, but this likely comes from knowing his internal conflicts from the book. It occasionally touched on Pierre's search for meaning, yet without showing the audience anything about his struggle with religion or his bravery during the invasion of Moscow, he appeared but a husk of his novel persona. The book is famously known for being dense and boring, but this film version was truly a slog. The cinematography felt like an afterthought, and the acting was stinted at best. Going in, I was cynical about the American and British casting, and I found myself getting pulled out of the Russian setting constantly. The three main actors unfortunately felt uninspired and staged, which is a shame because they're all great in other films.I can't deny I was expecting a lot more regardless of its Western-centric cast and limitations in scope, but I still aim to watch other adaptations to see if it really is possible to portray War and Peace cinematically.",3,war-and-peace

25524,"I NEED TO SIN!Love Exposure is a film that I can’t really make heads or tails of... I mean, I understood what was happening, and I think it has a lot going for it, but there’s really no reason the story should be stretched out to a 4 hour film. It’s painfully melodramatic, and while it’s interesting, there’s no way in hell something can stay this interesting for 4 hours. The goofy nature of the film remedies this a bit, but charm can only bring you so far through something like this.While it may sound like I hated it, I believe it’s a pretty great film overall. There’s hardly ever a misstep, and there’s some really fantastic moments in it. The presentation is arguably the best aspect of Love Exposure. From the cinematography that sways from being charmingly amateurish to excellent on a dime, to the soundtrack that really enhances some of the best moments in the film (albeit getting repetitive after 4 hours) Love Exposure does a lot to keep you engaged in the exceedingly bizarre ride that it portrays. The ability to tell a story this hectic, and still be able to make it cohesive is definitely a high achievement indeed.Essentially, I’m conflicted. While all these great things stand out, the length remains this films greatest enemy. A lot of the lesser moments feel as if they drag, and they make this 4-hour epic feel less than stellar at times. The story being told here could have EASILY been 2 1/2 hours, maybe 3 from cutting all the unnecessary dragging. Would I recommend it? Sure, if it looks like your kinda thing. It’s like a Takashi Miike film, but a lot easier to watch. Just beware the time of this beast. A segmented viewing is probably the best experience you can get from this. While I’m still puzzled on my feelings, I feel that a strong 6 is a good score for this until I either rewatch it, or think about it more.

33259,"Wow. Just a perfect film. So meticulous and observant in the gravitas of covert resistance. It’s methodical, cold, oppressive, and often confusing, but that’s more than likely Melville’s intention: to create an atmosphere as grey and hampering as fighting fascism on your own home soil, where you don’t know who is on your side. Obviously, we know that WW2 ends with Nazi Germany’s downfall. But to the resistance members of this film, 3 years from the war’s end, they are fighting a battle for their own country’s autonomy against the most unimaginable callousness of the human soul without any arbitrary accolades or celebration...and no clear end in site. No honor, no glory— just the crushing weight of resistance on your shoulders. Knowing Melville’s involvement in the resistance, I can tell this is clearly a very personal work of his. And it sucks that this was released in such a political turbulent time as late 60s (read up on the ‘68 Paris strike and riots), so it never really reached contemporary domestic or international acclaim upon its release— but as time has grown its been seen as Melville’s masterpiece. Melville is still a filmmaker I need to accumulate myself with, but I have no doubt in saying this might be one of the finest movies I’ve had the pleasure of seeing.

72431,"The biggest illusion in The Prestige is the illusion that it's actually a good film. Nolan always has a great talent for coming up with really interesting concepts but he often sucks at coming up with interesting characters and conflicts to explore the concepts with. There's lots of potential in a film about two magicians in Victorian London who are fiercely competitive, trying to steal each others' tricks and sabotage their shows. And then that combined with a transportation machine which works by creating an exact copy of yourself in a different location and then destroying the original - have you technically just killed yourself? What happens to your consciousness? Will the copy really be you? How do you dispose of your original body?On paper this film sounds like something I'd really enjoy but Nolan just fails to put anything interesting into the presentation of the story and his characters are flat and generic and failed to capture my interest or sympathy in the slightest. Again Nolan lazily falls back on killing protagonists' wives to give them some depth and motivation - seriously dude get some imagination!! The female characters in this film are pathetically written, just objects for the men to fight over and use to hurt each other. It's boring we see this sort of kidnapping/killing of wife/daughter propelled shit in every other film - it's sloppy and boring please stop! And just like in Interstellar, Nolan fails again and tells rather than shows his audience everything. There was some fun in the spectacle of the magic tricks and Nolan does begin to explore some interesting themes on teleportation and magicians but only a little bit. The film parades itself as a twist and turn taking thriller but the actual reveal was a bit of a let down and I found the whole thing just a bit uninspiring to be honest.",1,the-prestige

62562,"letterboxd.com/pinheadlarry145/list/martin-scorseses-film-school-the-85-films/The first stop on my journey to becoming a Martin Scorsese Certified Cinephile is the post-war city of Vienna; where Carol Reed's audacious noir masterpiece The Third Man takes place. On the outside looking in there are many enticing elements to this classic film apparent before you even press play. In addition to its groundbreaking cinematography it also has Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles acting in the respective primes of their careers. Orson in particular has a way of physically and nonphysically taking control of any film he appears in and this one is no different. His character in The Third Man, the American Harry Lime, begins as a mere whisper in the wind. We learn a lot about his character post mortem from his best childhood friend Holly (Joseph Cotten) and his longtime Russian refugee lover. She recalls (mostly set to sombre string music that really plucks at some melencholy chords) how secure he made people feel and how he always knew how to have fun. But as his best friend Holly knows he had a darker side. Which is why the circumstances of his accidental death come with some skepticism. We learn fairly early on that this is not a friendly city. No one is who they seem and when you want to find the truth, it may cost you your life. Holly's quest to find out what happened to Lime and why he was called here to this ravaged city is what I would consider to be a masterclass of film noir storytelling. Its paced fairly well even by todays standards and knows when to slow down to get to know certain characters as well as when to take off into high flying chase sequences. Some story/character nuances present in the film also surprised me all things considered. For example Orson Welles character entrance with the cat chewing on his shoestrings was so damn cool. Might be one of the coolest character entrances ever. I'll say it again, Welles' presence controls any film he is in. Once he is introduced it changes the dynamic of the film entirely. Harry Lime and Hollys meeting in the ferris wheel (which is one of the many spectacular technical scenes) as well plays a pivotal role in how we are supposed to feel about these characters. Like the main character Holly we are pulled in many different directions on how we are supposed to sympathize with these people. Even before the brilliant ending we sense that there is no way the film can have a happy ending. It wouldnt be a noir with a happy ending now would it?Now Ive spent a majority of the time discussing the plot and the characters but the real reason I was drawn into The Third Man and what will likely will be the lasting impression on me was the visual style of the film. The film was released in 1949 so a commercial project being fully commited to a distinct visual languge was still a fairly uncommon thing. Its obvious that the cinematography was meant to reflect the angst of the characters and the political landscape of Vienna at the time. We get some breathtaking night time city shots, abandonned bombed out buildings as well as illusory shadowplay. All in glorious restored black and white film. Since the stars of these old noir films are all likely dead and gone, I always get a twinge of nostalgia and sadness when watching these kinds of films by default. But this film has much more actually going on on-screen to facilitate these feelings to the nth degree. While noir is not typically my film genre of choice, I cannot deny The Third Man is a shadowy, angsty noir masterpiece that I find difficult to rate any lower than a perfect score. It deserves nothing less.",9,the-third-man

54332,"Spouse: “What are you watching this time?”Movie Obsessed Person: “A 6 hour Italian made-for-TV movie.”Spouse: looksMovie Obsessed Person: “It’s on the list.” I remember when The Best of Youth hit Netflix, it was a big deal in some circles. It currently sits at #114 on the Letterboxd Top 250 movies and has an 8.5 with 22,000 votes on IMDb. This film has made an impact on folks. It covers 4 decades in the life of an Italian family, focusing firmly on two brothers: Matteo & Nicola. In this sprawling familia epic we are introduced to our brothers at the end of an academic year. They are going before their professors for their final exams. Immediately we see that Matteo has an extensive internal life that is not shown to others, he is perhaps hiding himself from everyone. Nicola greets the world with an open mind, he seems more accepting of life on its terms. Matteo walks out of his exam when his professor disagrees with one of his opinions, while Nicola nabs an A. Matteo lashes out by going to an asylum and breaking a young patient out who has been subjected to electric shock therapy. As the brothers and two friends plan to head off to Norway for vacation, the two brothers take a detour to bring this young woman home to her family.Things of course go awry. The young woman had been placed there by her family and they were not prepared to take her in. Eventually, the police detain the woman and she is whisked back away into the system. The brothers are despondent. Matteo abandons Nicola and heads back toward Rome. Nicola forges on to Norway, but he doesn’t meet up with their friends and goes alone. At this point our brothers are literally on two different paths. Matteo abandons youth liberal optimism, joins the military and later the police force. He seems to seek external structure. While Nicola becomes a middle class vagabond in Norway, taking a gap year in school, grows a beard, sleeps with Scandinavians, and works in a lumber yard. Typical youthful rebellion stuff. I won’t go into detail on the rest. We follow them both, Matteo increases in anger and has outbursts throughout his career in the military/police, while Nicola opens up a progressive mental healthcare facility. Parents age and die. Sisters get married and divorced. Two friends pop back around eventually. A particularly melodramatic subplot with Nicola’s partner, a more dedicated communist than himself becomes a focal point for a while. Nothing about The Best of Youth struck me as bad other than the makeup jobs on the actors. When they had to age one that is either more youthful or elderly than their natural appearance, it is almost comical. It is a solid story that is well-acted. However, for a 6 hour film, it never creates enough depth in its characters. I never felt drawn into Matteo’s turmoil and why his anger seethed so deeply. I didn’t feel any nuance or purpose in Nicola’s subtle shifts of personal focus. Everything is broad, characters' emotions are stated blandly. Visually this is a good TV movie, but it isn’t more than that.

It's probably not as popular as it is for no reason and I guess if I would've seen this movie earlier in my life it would've effected me more, but I can't say that anything in this movie was new to me.

The themes of identity presented are very interesting, but they’re constantly forced down the throat of the viewer. Almost every line feels really forced, as though the movie thinks the audience is way too stupid to understand it. It comes across as a Dora episode about existentialism.I love the look and feel of it though. The stark black and white and alienating sci-fi set pieces compliment each other perfectly.

Landscape In The Mist is loaded with little moments of large impact.The story is basically “Two children journey the long road to Germany to find a non existent man they believe to be their father.”On the road, they learn the realities of life – cruelty, violence and the crude struggle for survival, but also friendship and the first stirrings of romance. In a particularly startling scene, joy and sorrow are revealed simultaneously as a horse dies before their eyes, even as a marriage is gleefully celebrated nearby. In another, the hand of a statue pulled out of the water could symbolise fragmentation (other than the obvious reaching out something that is constantly moving away from you motif), among several other things.

The vast majority of the movie is monotonous montages of household chores and a mundane life, all setting up the very last minute of the movie. Two-hundred minutes attempted to be paid off by one; didn't really work for me. Spoilers from here on out.Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles is certainly well made though. Fantastic performance from the lead and stellar cinematography. Didn't care for the dialogue though, even though there was so little. Very expository and unsubtle, often forced. Still, well made. But everything leading up to the end killed me. I do think all of it sets up the end well though. Analyzing the patriarchy (through her son), showing how the frustrating, seemingly normal life can lead to something like that, how someone can appear fine but be fucked-up; it's all solid stuff. Killing her client at the end left me shocked, but it also felt right. In that it's something her character would've done. I really liked that last minute.But again, not really anything that came before. That same character arc and set-up can come from something much more gripping and exciting, while achieving the same development. And for someone who cares and rates (mostly) based on how much a movie entertains them or keeps them interested, Jeanne Dielman is going to lose points for being incredibly boring. A lot of points. Like I said before, it's an experiment, and, in my opinion, a failed one. Very strong story and character let-down by some of the most unbearable stuff I've ever watched. I don't know, maybe this rating isn't fair, because I don't even think this is a bad movie. At all. I just despised watching it.

8996,"[42][Spoilers ahead.]Incredibly weird movie, one whose almost unanimous praise left me perplexed. The only explanation is that it's easy to mistake inherent emotional response for objective quality. Yes, children dying and cities getting bombed are tragic event that are bound to disturb anyone’s comfort zone. Duh. But precisely what is the point? Skimming through the reviews, a common denominator is viewers praising the film for its powerful anti-war sentiment, to which I reflect on my major criticisms of works like e.g. 12 YEARS A SLAVE or THE PIANIST: Do we need a perpetual jackhammer of localized, hyperfocused agony and suffering to understand that slavery or war or [insert barbaric, historical human blight of choice] is bad? This is simply an unabashed descent into misery—a concentrated, conscious effort of subsequent misfortunes meant solely to make us feel progressively shittier about the fates of our protagonists. (Fates which are foolishly undermined by the first goddamn scene, no less.) There are too many failures of reason in the story, too, e.g. the aunt might be a mega-bitch, but there’s no reason Seita, spry and able-bodied as he is, shouldn’t contribute to the homestead, even something as remedial as routine chores. Conversely, as utterly resistant as a young teen might be to helping, I refuse to accept that a guardian would consciously exile his or her adolescent niece and nephew into war-torn wilderness with nothing. But, what’s this? Seita has access to his mother's bank account, you say? Shame that he neglects to use this massive safety net until his sister is on the brink of total evaporation. In any case, show me any kid his age, no matter how stubborn or spoiled, would opt for an apocalyptic hellscape and starvation over tolerating crabby relatives and conducting occasional housework. Instead, Seita commits torturously prolonged manslaughter, and the film yet again sidesteps legitimate thorniness by having him die shortly thereafter, physically and mentally exonerated from the burden of responsibility for having killed his sister. So, not only is this just ship-in-a-bottle construction of Relentlessly Depressing Cinema, it’s cowardly, too, thanks to the cosmic absolution that waives the main character’s stupidity of any chance he might have to legitimately suffer or learn from it.",4,grave-of-the-fireflies

Akira KurosawaA wonderful transfer of the vibes of the Far East (Ussuri region, forest Taiga 🌲🍂, like a difficult, dangerous and impassable place) from the Japanese classic Akira Kurosawa, based on the novel-essay of the same name, traveler and explorer of the Far East Vladimir Arsenyev (1872-1930).1902, Ussuri region. Carrying out a topographical survey of the area, a Cossack expedition led by Captain Arsenyev meets the elderly goldman Dersu from the Uzala clan in Taiga. Dersu's entire family died of smallpox, and for two years now he has been hunting alone in these parts. Arsenyev persuades the old man to become a guide for his detachment, and during the journey a warm and trusting relationship arises between them.The taiga beauty of the forest 🏞️ and the severity of nature 💧❄️🌀 alternate together: be it a descent down the river, or the survival of the freezing main faces in a stack of quickly laid reed hay 🌾 in the wind 🌬️, on Lake Khanka.The Tuvan actor Maxim Munzuk / Dersu Uzala looks excellent on the screen (Kurosawa wanted to see his muse Toshiro Mifune in this role, but after the actor refused the project, the director was delighted with how masterfully, theatrically the 65-year-old Tuvan entered into the character, creating sympathy for to his hero. Yuri Solomin in the role of Captain Arsenyev, showed his character as a wise and good person.The vast territory of the Ussuri region: the complex world of nature, and the world of the northern gold man. Dersu, a unique personality - a man lives in balance and in harmony with nature, remaining a hardened man. An imbalance in the forest environment will inevitably lead to tragedy (“Amba” is like the ghost of fear of the Ussuri tiger 🐅, if it is not handled correctly). Dersu knows where and how animals 🦙 fall into traps (pits) for other people. Dersu shows the Cossacks these places to free the game and lay a trap with sticks. Dersu can sense enemies a mile away, as well as various settlers of Taiga, who can kidnap people and quarrel with each other. Vast nature, difficult to live in, with difficult, harsh conditions. Akira Kurosawa brings to the screen a psychological, adventure drama: “A man is too small in the face of great nature.” Magic realism of the Japanese-Soviet friendship between the Taiga hunter and the Cossack. 7.5/10",6,dersu-uzala
22003,"""Do you know anything about a guy going around playing the harmonica? He's someone you'd remember. Instead of talking, he plays. And when he better play, he talks."" What a pleasure it was for me to finally get to watch this masterpiece which I kept on putting off because of its nearly three hour runtime. I was blown away by Sergio Leone’s direction in The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, and that was the only film of his that I’d seen up to this point, but now I honestly can’t say which of the two films I prefer. This is perhaps a better film because it is set on a grander and epic scale, but perhaps not as entertaining as the other. Both films have terrific performances with memorable characters and a masterful score composed by Ennio Morricone that accompanies Tonino Delli Colli’s beautiful cinematography. Leone’s exaggerated close ups show us the dirt and the sweat coming out of these grim people’s faces and it’s juxtaposed perfectly with these extremely long shots of the vastness of the Western valley. I can’t imagine liking this film more than I already do, but it is clear that these films were made to experience them in the big screen and it’s a pity I couldn’t do so. There are also many memorable quotes in this film and I absolutely loved the screenplay. For the first 90 minutes or so I wasn’t sure what direction the movie was heading and that is what I liked about this film since it had me guessing at some of the characters motivations and where the plot was trying to go. The characters have a lot depth and not even the villain is portrayed in a stereotypical way.  Along with Unforgiven these are the three best Westerns I’ve seen so you can bet I will watch more of Leone’s spaghetti westerns in the future. The film couldn’t open in a more spectacular fashion as the camera follows three gunmen waiting for someone at a station. Once the train arrives, the men don’t find who they are waiting for and as they are walking away they hear someone playing a harmonica. It is the mysterious man they’ve been expecting (Charles Bronson) who asks them where Frank is. They’ve been sent to kill him, but Harmonica is too quick for their guns and finishes them off claiming they “brought two (horses) too many.” Then we are introduced to a recently married family man who is living on his deserted property with his three children and expecting his new wife to arrive that very day, but a group of bandits led by blue eyed Frank (Henry Fonda) kills them all one by one for reasons that aren’t explained yet. The bride, Jill (Claudia Cardinale), arrives to find them all murdered and the officers find evidence that lead them to believe that the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) is responsible. The lives of these three men all intersect with Jill’s and as the story develops the plot and mystery unfolds.  Sergio Leone had me engaged with the film from the very opening sequence and he sets the slow paced tone rather quickly. He takes his time to let the action unfold but thanks to the beautiful cinematography and the gripping score I was never bored for a minute. I was continually trying to guess what was going on and what the motivation of each character truly was. I was surprised that Leone decided to have Ford’s character shoot a young kid in a very early scene in the movie, and I can only imagine what a shocker that must have been for audiences during that time who were used to seeing Ford play the hero. Bronson is mysterious but it is rather obvious from the beginning what his intentions are. He still delivers a gripping performance as this mysterious character and when his backstory is finally revealed it all pays off. It was Robards’ character who had me guessing at times what his real intentions were. At first I believed he was going to be one of the main villains, but he delivers most of the funny scenes and was perhaps one of the best characters in the film. The breathtaking Claudia Cardinale may have not been given a strong female role, but she wasn’t simply a damsel in distress and she seemed to know what she was doing. Once Upon a Time in the West is not a straightforward revenge story and it blends several tones throughout the film having you sympathize with each character at different points of the story. Leone maintained the thrilling atmosphere for its entire runtime and the final showdown is rewarding. This is an epic masterpiece and a new addition to my favorite movies of all time list, and I’m glad I finally had the opportunity to experience it. It is a flawless film and deserves to be considered amongst the greatest movies ever made.estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9,once-upon-a-time-in-the-west

I must admit, that it would require skill to transfer this story successfully onto the screen, with all of its subplots and passage of time, so... did King Vidor manage to do it?I'd say so-so. I have seen some people complain that the run-time is way too long, however I cannot imagine trying to believeably tell this story in two hours, per say. I mean, sure, it could be done, but I just cannot imagine it. I have to say, that, while I wasn't necessarily bored with this, there are certain elements of the story that feel just so trivial and inconsequential, they are bleak in comparison to some other moments in the movie. now, I'm willing to wager that the source material probably handled that better, but overall I cannot say it was a bore to go through, just that it dragged on in some places.there were many directorial choices that I liked and it is quite impossible not to marvel at how this movie looks and presents itself. there was a lot of work put into this for sure, and the beautiful shots, so many extras, amazing landscapes, set and costume design are just great. they were most likely the highlight of this whole experience, alongside the fabulous score by Nino Rota (instantly was reminded of The Godfather's score).I certainly liked the big three, acting-wise: Hepburn, Fonda and Ferrer, I think they did a good job with the material they were given. I'd say that the script was working against them for periods of time, and while I really liked the romance subplot of Natasha-Andrei, several pieces of dialogue sounded out of place for me, not organic, if I may say so. at the same time though, I'm reminded of the good moments, which I feel like balance out the weaker ones. but it didn't really hinder the experience. these elements comprised made a decent movie, maybe not a one I'd rewatch, but one whose certain elements I'll remember fondly.",5,war-and-peace

I believe this is my first Billy Wilder movie and it’s not a great start if I’m quite honest. I’m fully aware this took place in 1950, but even still I just found myself uninterested for the largest amount of time of this film, only retaining my attention towards the last 20 minutes, which was still underwhelming to what I was expecting. I really didn’t like how the orchestra music would start playing randomly and I know the idea is that Norma believes she’s living in a play and everything is for the cameras, but it just didn’t work for me. The only other thing I thought was different in a positive way was the handleless doors.

29711,"Here is what I wrote for my Italian Cinema class:I did not enjoy this film at all.Life Is Beautiful tells the story of a Jewish Italian who does everything he can to protect his son from witnessing the horror of the concentration camp they are imprisoned in. I have no issues with first half of the film, beyond the fact that I found it mundane and unfunny, which is fine. Its satire of the racial laws of Italy and the Fascist mindset was amusing. The second half, however, is when I began to feel uncomfortable with what I was watching. Guido’s scheme is ridiculous. I understand the movie is showing how much Guido loves his son by protecting him from the horrors of the Holocaust. If the movie was even one bit honest about what actually happened though, it would have no choice but to acknowledge that Guido’s goal is impossible. Everything heartbreaking is kept offscreen from the viewer: the death of Uncle Eliseo is only implied, and the mass murder by gas chamber is revealed by a pile of clothes (which, granted, was effective). This technique of keeping the atrocities at the margin falls apart when one realises that the Holocaust was nothing but atrocity. The director chose to hide the horror from the audience, but that doesn’t excuse hiding the horror from the characters. From the very moment Giosué (and the viewer) steps off the train, it would be impossible for him not to see some of the most heartbreaking and merciless acts of cruelty ever inflicted by mankind. People were executed for the most trivial reasons. Bodies were left outside to rot in full view of those still alive. But the movie doesn’t show it. The Holocaust represents humanity at its absolute worst. It is institutionalized evil. The concentration camp of Life Is Beautiful is a cardboard castle where people can play hide and seek without punishment. The most offensive scene in the film—I can’t imagine how disrespectful it must be to those who lived (and died) in the camps—shows Giosué asking to leave the camps… but being successfully convinced to stay by his father with the promise of a prize. If the film was honest about how cruel a concentration camp really is, the scene would end with Giosué giving up on the tank and desperately wanting to leave, leaving his father to explain why he can’t.",0,life-is-beautiful

His performance is so unhinged that I honestly think he wasn’t acting. He’s just really like that and it makes for an entertaining watch. Apart from that, the acting and the camera work is great as you would expect from a PTA movie. Unfortunately, the story is what really falls flat for me. I really could not connect with any of these characters. Even in those emotional moments where I should be feeling choked up are nonexistent. There are numerous stories with a lot of complex themes and metaphorical imagery that it was hard to keep up most of the time.  I know Magnolia is adored by many people and I feel like the odd man out for not liking this movie, but I just have to be honest with you guys.

57538,"I could say the overused phrase, ""I feel like I saw a different movie from everyone else"", to describe my feelings towards Fight Club (one of the most revered films of all time) but really - I don't. I just know I hated it. Perhaps I'm an annoying ray of sunshine who can't deal with the gritty, grotesque world that David Fincher depicts in his seminal modern classic or I'm too stupid to deal with the twist or perhaps I just don't appreciate film and I don't deserve to even have a Letterboxd account or yadda yadda - all I know is that I absolutely despised it. Right from the get-go I was bored out of my mind right up till a brief interval (a period of about ten minutes) where I began to dig it but as soon as the Project Mayhem things began I again felt myself returning to a state of endless boredom. I liked the ending (Oh that legendary, almighty twist which my father spoiled 15 minutes in) but my overall feelings toward Fight Club are unfortunately negative. It's not that I like being in this camp alone while 37% of Letterboxdians out of the 60k who've seen this rated it five stars but I do seriously feel like I saw a different movie.That being said, there are some pros among a sea of cons. The three main stars (Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter, to a lesser degree) are excellent and David Fincher is a master. But even they can't save this film. Brad Pitt, at times though, is so hottt it's pretty fucking distracting. I can't lie to everyone just because it's the seventy-seventh highest rated film on Letterboxd - I loathed it, I detested it, I execrated it. I'll have to give it another shot just because I can't fathom how a film this good can be so bad. Anyone care to join my camp? December 2015 Ranked",2,fight-club

71559,"This film is such a heartfelt story, with an overwhelming love for humanity. I think this film is Kurosawa at his most hopeful, he uses the character of Dersu Uzala to portray this love of humanity, to be overly trusting, and most of the time, it pays off. Humans are beautiful in their actions, their interactions with nature and one another. This story could have easily dived nihilism, but it never reached this point. It's always hopeful despite the circumstances, and we're continually proved that humanity is something we should cherish and love.I also loved how this film tackles capitalism's effects on culture, essentially eradicating cultures and lifestyles. The part of the film where Dersu Uzala is in ""civilization"" is so eye-opening; it's so harshly contrasted with the rest of the film that you feel his confusion and anger at the system and the absurd commodification of essential goods.Week 48 of the 2021 Criterion Challenge.",6,dersu-uzala

15545,"“The play and the movie are about anger, but they don't want to provoke anger. The movie’s talking about politics, but it has to be apolitical.”“I don’t think of it as a movie about war: I think of it as a movie about family”-Denis Villenueve talking about his film where a victim of the Lebanese Civil War has his son taking away and turn into a child soldier, and sees a massacre perpetrated by Christian nationalists that turn her into a political assassin.From the Radiohead needle drop to the twist, I was asking myself what the hell is Villenueve's problem.The moment we get to the flashbacks we are so bombarded by information and the overbearing acting that it was almost hysterical to watch. The guy is just pulling every plot beat from a dead boyfriend from another part of the conflict to dishonor to being pregnant to leaving the house to having a baby to losing it because of the circumstances, and all in the space of 5 minutes of watching the character's being miserable without even allow the movie to breath and acknowledge any of them in the first place, and it’s repulsive.He’s a sadist, but one that pretends it’s actually respectful and skillful in its treatment of dramaturgy. Instead of holding to the process of dealing with the tragedy of bloodlines finding the true horror of their heritage we are never allow to perceive anything from our subject beyond of what we get from earlier preconceptions. A son starts hating his mom only to start searching her past because of her sister, but we never allow to see his perspective or any other around him sit before he starts have it challenge or make the audience realize that is what is happening on screen.And this problem extends to the portray of the Lebanese conflict as well. Because the film tries to be so ambiguous/impartial that it comes across as desperate to not offend anyone and it still does. It’s a film where we see our protagonist going from student to war prisoner, but it barely allows the ideology or reasons to dig aside from a comment made by someone who didn’t experience it like our protagonist that ends up being so superficial and neither challenges the audience or the characters, and doesn’t go beyond a sensationalist perception of terrorist atrocities. It’s a story about discovering the complicated nature of your roots yet it never allows itself to go beyond the artificial images that it creates. The twins might as well be nobodies finding about this random woman's struggle and we would have get as much emotional investment.Ok, spoilers and...(CW: rape, incest)The image of Nawal in the ground in prison might as well be the face of the director in his chair so proud of not letting himself falling in the traps of exploiting the subject without realizing that he’s just doing that. Nawal is almost obligated to carry children (again) to this world yet her dealing with it is only settle to just one sentence, one scene of her being tell to carry the work of her rapist, before coming back to the advance of the story. Hell, the big reveal is a great example of it, because Villenueve loves so much the beats as individual moments rather than a narrative at large that he barely cares what Nawal feels when she has to face after acknowledging the fact that she was raped by his own son. The process was already done without letting us experience it, and she apparently has forgiving him and she forgives him because he’s also a victim. Her individuality was taking away constantly and we apparently have to accept that she just accommodated to it. That we have to accept that we are sometimes victims, and that our experience is as much the experience of the one who oppressed us.And, sorry I can’t. Not only because we never see the reasoning, the process, the why and how she got to that conclusion, but because Nihad, who has experience the conflict at first hand (one could say even more than her as an active participant) was never allow to become something more than a monster who is implied have tortured and raped so many women and killed so many people that settling with “within the worst, there’s also Love” is such a despicable and even more naive way to conclude this story. And more than anything, the fact that he goes from one band to another without ever emphasizing this change of ideology reflects the apolitical view of the movie, and stresses this film not so much as a recognition of the victims and players of the conflict, but as a playground for the vile narrative that its director is creating.",1,incendies

29570,"This was his gift to me.Somewhat complicated feelings on this one that I think are stemming from completely logical places, but for the time being resigning myself to being mostly positive about the overall experience. I can now say I've seen a Holocaust movie that I would predominantly label as ""cute."" Not even in the twee way or with a big asterisk like I would with, say, Jojo Rabbit. It's clear Life is Beautiful is being made by a writer, director, and lead actor who truly honest to God believes that title. Roberto Benigni's own father having been someone who actually went through a concentration camp, I believe that even in the more awkward in a poor way attempts at humor and levity here that it's all coming from the best possible place imaginable. It's in some way respectable, even at worst in the Don Quixote galloping at windmills way, for someone to be this hopeful and silly even when looking at one of if not just the single most tragic and dehumanizing event in modern history. Roberto Benigni's performance in the film was to me frequently at the levels of complete Parmesan cheese that Jared Leto was as Paolo Gucci in House of Gucci, but at least here, you know, the Italian character is actually played by an Italian actor and he just naturally looks that dopey. Admittedly strange thing to say that I do overall prefer my films about this event and others like it to be on the grim and dramatic side like my recently watched The Pianist, but for this being the kind of movie that it is with the kind of subject matter it's built around, it really could be way worse. Again, it's cute, and parts of it are undeniably moving and just enveloping. It's hard to imagine someone watching this and not being won over by something in it, a music cue, a visual gag, the tragic tinge to the ending with a child still smiling and yelling from a personal victory, so on and so forth. Don't think it's one of the best movies ever made by any stretch of the imagination, but it was ""good.""7/10",6,life-is-beautiful

57958,"3000 Followers CelebrationPicked by: louferrigno, Trever Habermayer, David Wheeler, Lars Thurgood, and Henry Rowlands.Akira Kurosawa is so well suited to Shakespeare, because he too works with broad themes and human struggles. The great difficulties of being human - power, pain, fear - are exactly what both liked to explore. As an adaptation of Macbeth, Throne of Blood is actually quite faithful. Obviously the setting and context and language are gone, but what remains is the story and the themes. It may not have Shakespeare's almost literal poetry, but it has visuals so strong they almost equal Shakespeare's words. Everything is so excellently staged, with moments of symmetry, the weather becoming a portal to the world, and movement that is always precise and clear. There's evocative images of blood, bones, and deathly white spirits. The film's most haunting image comes when the Lady Macbeth equivalent, Washizu Asaji, tries to wash her hand of imaginary blood. It is an incredibly portrayed scene of torment, leading into a vicious and maddening finale. Toshiro Mifune truly conveys panic and insanity in those last moments, but his performance as the lead character is dynamic from the start. More explicit than some versions, Throne of Blood questions whether the prophecies are true or whether they become true because they are believed and acted upon. Throne of Blood is Kurosawa doing what he does best. It's perfect filmmaking designed by a master, all in service of a story that stirs our emotions.Akira Kurosawa RankedMy Top Films of the 1950s",8,throne-of-blood
3620,"Sadly I do not belong to the group of people who have great admiration for this film. While the last hour was fairly interesting, probably because it centred on the only three characters I cared about (the father, the daughter and the young boy), I struggled to find something, anything in the first couple of hours that was of interest. All I could come up with were 3 scenes as well as any time spent with Ota, the Japanese business man.1. The dinner and karaoke scene with Ota, especially when he wonders why it is we have a tendency to be afraid of anything new, and yet we wake up every morning to a completely new day without being afraid. 2. The scene in the car where the boy wonders if we only ever know half truths because we can't see what is going on behind us.3. The scene where the daughter, sitting by her grandmother, wonders if she forgot to take the garbage out, causing her grandmother's stroke.In those first two hours I had extra coffee, chips, anything to prevent boredom or sleep. I even took a short break at each hour hoping it would refresh me a little. It isn't that it is a terrible film. It is well made, the acting is good, and there are some pretty neat camera shots and perspectives (through windows, through open doorways, through security cameras). The pacing was nice and slow, which I tend to prefer. The main issue I had with the film is that I found it outright boring. If you like family dramas that tend towards soap operas then this is the film for you.  Not so much for me.The last hour was much better, but then again I played mind tricks with myself. At the 2 hour mark I pretended that I was now going to be watching a 1 hour film. Maybe that helped, although I think the last hour really was much better.I really wanted to love this one.  I'm sure it deserves a higher rating because it truly is an accomplished film, but since it belongs in my personal list of films I badly wanted to turn off, I can't justify anything higher.Part of the Sunday Mornings with Coffee series.",4,yi-yi
31208,"The medieval times are emo as hell. Ingmar Bergman’s metaphoric exploration of death is a thought provoking experience. The cinematography is stunning and the discussions about the afterlife are very well written. This film is full of memorable images and lines that will stick in your head for awhile. Max von Sydow’s face alone looks like a sculpture in the frame. The cast can over-act at times but the ominous presence of death by Benny Ekerot is great. The opening waterfront chess game with Death is captivating and looks incredible. As we meet the remaining characters, my favorite discussion comes with the painter talking about how he seeks to frighten the audience rather than please them. The movie is very much in conversation with itself. More questions regarding faith and death are asked and the symbolic imagery is amazing when the parade of people march in with crosses, praying. Death lurks in every moment as the group joins for a picnic. It’s hilarious as the dudes drink and talk about love. Another gripping image is the girl who is dying but doesn’t feel a thing. It reminds me of The Passion of Joan of Arc. Antonius then makes a recognizable sacrifice to save the others and we get to see their last supper. The biblical references are all over the place including one character actually saying “it is finished.” The final shots of the group being walked up the hill to their death are breathtaking. “Have you seen my wife?”“No, but if she looks like you, I’d do my best to forget her if I had” “It’s hell with woman and hell without them”👍56%Foreign list- Click HERE",5,the-seventh-seal

4285,"Almost feel likes it would work better as a mini series with how much it tries to flesh out in just over 2 hours with such an array of interesting characters/backstories(especially Knockout Ned who really doesn’t come into play until the third act). The narration cements the narrative structure but sometimes feels a bit heavy handed when there’s such a rich, immersive environment that speaks for itself. This is an ambitiously edited film(non linear structure included) and for the most part I think it captures the frenzied lifestyle of the favelas, one moment you’re embraced in an act of camaraderie the next your soul may be parting ways with your body.Cycles of violence are perpetuated at an incredibly young age, mirroring the corruption of the police/government. This film likes to focus more on the desensitization of such violence where death is just a normal day occurrence that can be jeered at and a corpse can be mocked by a pack of armed and rowdy kids. Some are condemned for their heinous acts while others are proclaimed heroes when in reality they are equally morally corrupt. We linger in that grey in a City of God where God is nowhere to be found.

Nothing like a killer blizzard to bring two men together, eh?

58177,"WINTER ""HIGH ART"" MARATHON #65My second Akira Kurosawa film after watching Rashomon recently, and I gotta say, I liked this a LOT more than Rashomon. Macbeth has always been my favorite Shakespeare play. I had to do a course on it in grade three (!!!!!!!) and it's always been one of those rise and fall stories that laid the foundation for stuff I would seek out later in life. Kurosawa brings his signature epic scale to the table to make something really one-of-a-kind here. Lady Macbeth was great and really fucking creepy in this version. The make-up around her eyes mixed with that evil smile is stuff of nightmares.Just like Rashomon, there's a lot of really great shots here. The lighting and use of empty space it used really well here and it makes a lot of the shots look like genuine works of art. The whole ending is incredible, but the last note it ends on is straight up brilliant.

51146,"Wolfgang Petersen's adaptation of a novel by Lothar-Günther Buchheim about the crew of a WW II German submarine, U-96.  They are put into the Battle of the Atlantic in a very dangerous situation.  This film does much to shine a light on the perils of being in a submarine during the war and the fact that very few returned home.  It also showcases that most young men at war were really trying to do what they thought was right, and in this case that many didn't believe in the cause.  They too are as horrified at the war and conditions and they don't seem to know what they've gotten themselves in to.  This particular sailing is a bit different as Lieutenant Werner (Herbert Grönemeyer) is aboard and he's a journalist covering the events.  It's also very doom laden and bleak with so much tragedy all around.  It does have very impressive effects (lots of explosions) and it feels very realistic, I mean I obviously wouldn't know but it's very claustrophobic and immersive.  Some of the cinematography seems inventive as well, it's not an easy feat to make an epic film of this calibre and have it look pretty too.

89289,"8½ is cinema in its purest form.About 30 minutes in, I was impressed but remained mostly apathetic. Fellini's direction, use of space and power over atmosphere was excellent. You've got the great Nino Rota doing the score. The cinematography and lighting were brilliant but overall it hadn't quite grabbed me. Then that final hour came and the hours that followed after finishing it; and then did it truly hit me how frickin' incredible this surrealist masterpiece is.8½ is about Guido, a director under stress and frustration with artistic block, and pressing producers and paparazzi. He is also dealing with his own demons and personal problems as he attempts to make an ambitious epic science fiction film that is an honest transformative experience. Guido is such a complex character. He's a lying, cheating, narcissistic and egotistical douchebag and yet its so easy to relate to the creative process he is going through. No other movie captures the mind of the artist quite like 8½. It so expertly weaves between fantasy, memory and reality. So much so to the point where it doesn't matter whether we are experiencing Guido's reality or dreams because it is what is happening to Guido that is much more important. We go where he goes. It manages to do this whilst having pretty much perfect pacing and structure. There are many times, that I was just left speechless and in disbelief that someone could have made this film. As a film about a filmmaker trying to make a film, 8½ feeds into itself masterfully. It's as though Fellini is a magician showing us his hand but still dupes us in the end. 8½ is a powerful film that is loaded with layers. It's a film where I'll probably find something new every time I see it. I have to rewatch and rewatch to pick out all the little details.

That’s okay though, because I still love Gaspar’s films! And this was solid enough. Just didn’t blow me away.I didn’t feel any sympathy for the protagonists. It was pretty much just bad, stupid, immature people being whiny and annoying while they perform an illegal act. The boyfriend was the only rational person there.As annoying as these people were, it was still a little interesting to watch them plan this whole thing out. The acting was great and felt very real. To me, though, the stakes didn’t feel as high as I believe the movie intended them to be. I felt very little for the characters, despite being mildly interested in their actions. The hotel workers might have been a little curt and annoying, but the fuss these characters made over it was a bit ridiculous and tedious. I feel like the movie was trying to get me to feel worse for the characters than I actually did. The synopsis describes this movie as taking place during a “brutal communist regime” and I just didn’t get that sense at all. The worst thing was...rude hotel workers? At the same time, the movie wasn’t necessarily condoning their actions, and was definitely aiming for realism (and succeeding at that aspect), which I can respect.And the dinner scene seemed to go on forever. Despite being well-made and especially well-acted, this movie felt strangely directionless to me.I will say, that image near the end was incredibly stirring and affecting. Anyone who’s seen the movie knows what I’m referring to. I’m not too surprised that Gaspar likes this movie. There’s a similar image involving abortion in Enter the Void. It shows that, like it or not, this really is a baby you’re dealing with. Just a super small one.

2896,"Not to be confused with last years best movie, this version of Parasite is an occasionally entertaining mess, that really never comes together into something that I particularly enjoyed, even if I did find it a bit hard to hate. There is some fun to be had. It opens up with complete nonsense, and honestly I didn’t pick up on this movie being post-apocalyptic until some time into it. Like seriously, this movie looked more like my home town than it did much of an apocalyptic backdrop.The movie isn’t really what I expected it to be either. From the box art, I thought this would be about a massive creature, and maybe even some aquatic horror. Instead this movie is more of what the name of the movie is about more than anything. Again, there are moments of interest, but for the most part, it really doesn’t do much of anything.The creature that is in the movie is pretty cheesy, but in the good way. The last 30 or so minutes was more of what I wanted from this movie. It makes it into a fairly entertaining movie, but not something that I would really recommend as essential viewing. I recommend checking it out if you like the typical Charles Band cheese, but not for for really anyone else.Score Breakdown:Technical Meter - 4Fun-o-Meter - 6Combined Score - 5",4,parasite
63391,"Film #17 of Project 40”Love is simple.”Some film historians believe that this was in fact a response to the critically and financially successful Gone with the Wind and you can certainly see the contrasts both in terms of film’s general way of dealing with issues such as love, poverty, the passing of time and loyalty and also in its somewhat gritty visual style which is totally different from the gorgeous and sharp shots of Victor Fleming’s film. Les Enfants du Paradis is filled with the same kind of romanticism which is common in French literature and its epic scale, multiple characters with interwoven storylines and patient pace give the atmosphere of the film the feeling of a classic novel. While I can’t put my finger on anything specific but I admit that at the end of the day I felt that this was a little bit too long and too “French” for my taste meaning that despite all its positives – at least for now – I can’t say that I was amazed or surprised by this 190 minute piece of cinema. Basically this is a story of human emotions and how the change of times affects the way we deal with and more importantly perceive the tender feelings which play an essential role in our lives. The film consists of two parts each one focusing on a different era of its characters’ lives, while the first part works more like an introduction building the characters and establishing a dark and hopeless romantic world where everything seems to be in place to destroy those very tender emotions that I wrote about earlier but it is in the second part that the film finally gets going and becomes crueler and crueler about its characters, no one is going to experience happiness or joy here, the characters are trapped in a vicious cycle where everyone is only making the lives of their own and people around them harder and harder. And then there is this fundamental question that the film asks: Can time kill the flame of love between two people? Marcel Carne’s answer is a strict NO. It won’t die, in fact it will get harder to control as Baptiste and Garance finally understand it. Many characters come and go but it is the flame of this undying love between these two souls that shapes up the universe of Les Enfants du Paradis, for Marcel Carne what defines happiness is love, whoever experiences it lives a peaceful life and whoever can’t find it is condemned to live a bitter life of misery and woe and certainly all of film’s characters – from the unfortunate couple of Baptiste and Garance to the wretched and wicked Frederick Lemaitre and Lacenaire – belong to the latter group. Another layer of film’s universe is the whole theater vs. reality issue. The film’s universe is divided into two separate yet at the same time attached parts, while performance and drama are essential in the way we see characters in their theatrical profession but they also carry that sarcasm, flashiness and overdramatic way of behaving, speaking and perceiving the world to their private lives, this actually blurs the line between reality and imagination in the film and further highlights that romantic and poetic side of the story and makes it clear that Carne’s general approach toward the medium, plot outline and the general logic of the story which shapes up the whole universe of the film is not that much different from what we had in Gone with the Wind.There is no doubt that Les Enfants du Paradis is a groundbreaking work, the fact that it was made over a four year period (1940-1944) where France was occupied by Nazis makes it clear that we are talking about a unique movie but perhaps some other time I may be able to appreciate this one more as some movies get more impressive as you age and gather more life experience, for now it’s only a good movie",6,children-of-paradise
62231,"A gimmicky premise that barely manages to fill the void that's created by the lack of actual substance here. I appreciate the audacity (if you can all it that) by Akerman to make the most boring film of all time, where nothing happens simply for the sake of it. The whole point is clearly to make you reflect your own choices in your own personal life, and similar scenarios that happen in the film. Because when nothing interesting is happening on screen, Jeanne Dielman turns out to be nothing more than a template that leaves the viewers to project their own experiences and thoughts. And that's not necessarily a bad thing though, it's just that films in my opinion need to have their own agendas, not a passive visualization of boring actions just simply for the sake of it. Simply because you can do something like that, and that thing exists, even if it's special, doesn't mean it's good in any sort of way.And listen, I like long films, they never intimidate me, and I'd even argue that it's really hard to make a boring 3 hour film, because the long runtime in someway ""forces"" you to insert meaningful and entertaining things into the film.I get it, I get it, Akerman shows a woman doing the same mundane things over and over again, testing the viewer's patience, but by solely focusing on this idea, this film is left with literally no other things to look at and feel. Once you get the point it becomes even more mundane, and the film genuinely makes the viewer to beg for something, just something to happen.I appreciate these types of films, and I do like some of them, but when you create a film that's so empty inside and out, what do you really expect?",4,jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles
78504,"Satoshi Kon's films are ones of momentum. Narratives barrel forwards with a focus on energy, pace and increasing visual creativity. As strange as it sounds, his works - most notably this and Paprika - can feel like side-scrolling video games: the sense of always running forwards to something new and never looking back.To that extent, it therefore makes sense that this is a film about narrative momentum. It is literally about the love of the chase - the joy in pursuit. It engages a handful of Macguffins and overt plot devices to enable it to be a dash through time and genre, always moving forwards. It is a light commentary on film narrative as a whole, that these ideas of quests – romantic pursuits and vague objectives – persist across genre and throughout cinematic history. This film gives a whistle stop tour of the Japanese film industry – across time – and finds connections through doing this. It touches on universalities while giving pleasing variety.It is a surface level adventure though, pure aesthetic (hits a shallow historical journey, especially noticeable now we have works like Nobuhiko Obayashi's Labyrinth of Cinema) to underpin a vague – and arguably unsatisfying – narrative. Our characters are as thin as their 2D representations, defined often as objects and as things to pursue. The film is built around an overt Macguffin, that is placed into the narrative out of pure contrivance, but the characters themselves occupy the same status as this object. Yes, this is all an excuse for the visual possibilities of animation but Satoshi Kon, and his collaborators, do not do enough with this bar pure linear storytelling. It is easy to get swept up in the beauty, and in the passion that underpins the whole thing, but this is a minor work. It is, however, interesting as a blueprint – or as a foundation – for what is to come. Paprika takes a lot of the formal experimentation here and does it more satisfyingly and to a greater degree.",5,millennium-actress

49471,"Michelle Yeoh is always irresistible. Michelle Yeoh doing kung fu is undeniable. We don’t get a lot of it here, but we do get it. She is, by miles, the best thing about this movie. Ke Huy Quan has some good fight sequences too, more than her, and his fanny pack duel echoes back to Yeoh’s own soft-weapon mastery in Magnificent Warriors (中華戰士) when she was just twenty-four years old. But this isn’t really a kung fu movie. It is, in fact, every movie all at once (as well as a third tier Rick & Morty episode, minus the philosophical cynicism). And if that sounds like a lot... boy is it. It's bombastic to the point of exhaustion. It's a perfect film for the cell phone generation, where constant re-contextualization occurs at the speed of a social media feed. Swipe right, real fast, we’re done with this story beat, let’s ogle, toggle, and feign sincerity for the next one. The movie steamrolls over authentic emotions at every single opportunity. Its enthusiasms are infantile. It's story structuring comes off like a first pass, what I call in my own work, ""a vomit pass"". If you told me this was written in four days, I'd say, ""yeah, that tracks"". It’s editing is often lofty, transcendent, even herculean, considering the maximalist mission of it all. Sometimes I loved this movie. I more often hated it. When it was done, I found it mostly overrated, overhyped, and certainly over-long.But Michelle Yeoh is in it. And she does do kung fu.

Screwball comedies are basically predicated on the assumption of low stakes. Some of the situations presented are so bleak that there just isn’t much humor to squeeze out of it, but they try anyway. I don’t think this goes far enough in lambasting the Nazi psychosis.

39976,"Part of the 30 countries festival.  FranceThe lovely thing about 400 blows is how Truffault takes care to show a difficult adolescence from the perspective of the young Antoine Doinel (played wonderfully by Jean-Pierre Léaud).  It is shown in the way Antoine overhears conversations about him between his mother and stepfather, conversations that almost always reveal the truth. He knows his mother doesn't like him much, that he was always a burden to her. He tries not to be. In fact he tries to please her (or appease her, although I'm not sure he is that sophisticated). He seems to take everything in stride without drama. It is the life he has. And he has a good friend, and oftentimes friends are the most important thing at that age.The most heartbreaking scene was when he was called out for having plagiarized his essay on his grandmother's death. He had taken an interest in this essay to please his mother who had offered him a prize if he did well. It was a touching scene between them, where she encouraged him to do well so that he might do better with his future than she did. He read Honoré de Balzac and seemed quite immersed in it, even creating an altar to the book. He did the best thing he knew how to do: use Balzac's words. After all, they spent hours in class reciting Le Lièvre; isn't that what one is supposed to do, learn words by heart and repeat them? I don't think he copied on purpose, which makes it more heartbreaking. So when the teacher quoted a line directly from his essay, basically calling him out as a cheat, I think he really wondered what he had done wrong.Having said that, it isn't always clear with Antoine when he's telling the truth. He doesn't seem to lie about important things but you can't really tell. It is another aspect of the film that is so rich. Antoine isn't a one-dimensional character and the young Léaud certainly doesn't play him like he is.  Truffault takes care to show him not as stoic per se, but as a kid who is too busy doing what he has to do to reflect on the types of questions that only adults take seriously.The title of the film is part of a literal translation of a French expression that means 'being up to no-good'. In the film, it doesn't matter that Antoine does something good, he gets the same results as if he had done something bad. He sets the table in one of the first scenes but he forgot to buy the flour and gets called for it. He submits the essay he worked so hard on and gets called a cheat. He returns something he stole and gets sent to Juvie.  He can't win. He's getting the blows left right and centre whether he's up to no-good or not. And there is something resilient in him that prevents him from being shot-down. Beautiful. While I admire Truffault for letting Antoine's story shine through without drama, without storytelling rules getting in the way of showing the character just being himself, I didn't come out of the film feeling particularly enamoured with the film. There was something lacking, something I can't pinpoint. Perhaps it is the pace, even though I tend to really like slowly paced films. Perhaps it is the lack of 'moments' or perhaps the 'moments' were there but too subtle.  There is definitely a distance between the viewer and the characters. You might feel for Antoine some of the time, but most of the time he's just doing his thing and you are just watching his thing being done, without investment, without caring too much. Perhaps that is what I thought was lacking. I don't mind that kind of coldness in films like 2001 where the film isn't about a character and his life; but when a film is about a character and his life I want more of a connection.",5,the-400-blows
46473,"Pretentious, monotone and uninspired, Wings of Desire is a hard pill to swallow, but I can't say I'm surprised since I know Wim Wenders can be very polarized when it comes to critical acclaim. The premise of angels observing human existence is not original, but can still strike a chord if done correctly. Yet, Wenders' second-rate imitation of Bergman-lite meditations backfires here, resulting in an overly boring, faux-intellectual drama that fails to connect with me. The black-and-white choice feels redundant, and the tendency to go hyper-philosophical regardless of occasion rids every ounce of human touch and momentum of this already mechanical story.

It is an illusion.""David Lynch, you clever bastard, you. I am now convinced you are the smartest man in Hollywood. You are the Winkie's-man, and I can hear you laughing maniacally at the thousands of man-hours spent trying to decipher this film. I think about the restless night you gave me mulling over all the vignettes and episodes tangentially related (and even then incoherent in light of the generally accepted plot), the hours I've spent today trying to map out a narrative, or even a meaning behind it all, and here's what I've come up with: David Lynch, looking to have himself a giggle, dreamed up a movie where the discussion about said movie is infinitely more interesting that the movie itself. He is the audience, we are the theater, and Mulholland Dr. is his ticket stub.Do I have interpretations on the events within the movie? Sure. Do they work, on a whole, to my satisfaction? No. My less refined and much less interesting interpretation is that Lynch cooked up an amazing cast of characters for what would have been an incredible TV show, couldn't get that pushed through, and decided to give Hollywood and its fans the middle finger with the end result.I can find no issue with the direction of Mulholland Dr. That Lynchian surrealism, much as if normalcy was an audio track and playing a millisecond behind what we expect, is thrilling as always. The characters were intriguing, and the twists and turns genuinely mind-wrenching. On a technical level, Mulholland Dr. is very feasibly a 5* film. The reason I can't give the film a pass in my book is that it seems to insist (regardless of the director's intent and this review's opening quote) that there is a deeper, unifying meaning behind it all (deeper than dreams vs. reality, ideal vs. actual, etc.).Or maybe it's me who insists on a grand unifier. Maybe I'm expecting something out of Mulholland Dr. it was never intended to provide. Maybe my rating is a judgement against myself. Maybe I was just tired after a long day watching strange movies. Regardless of who's to blame for my disappointment, like Diane, I refuse to deal with the implications presented before me.At least this time around.",3,mulholland-drive
45876,"Aileen Wuornos is about to commit suicide when she meets Selby, a young woman with whom she thinks there may be a new chance to rebuild her life. Together they get carried away by their need to be loved and accepted, and what begins as a passionate relationship will soon have disastrous consequences. Monster is a drama inspired by true events about the murders committed by Wuornos and her relationship with the aforementioned Selby (a character based on someone else). It is the story of a completely broken person; a woman who has been abandoned, abused and humiliated countless times throughout her life and whose circumstances drive her into prostitution and marginalization. Personally, I think the film' s major flaw is focusing the story on the dependent and toxic relationship between Aileen and Selby, something that ultimately becomes a predictable story of betrayal that ends in tragedy. It would have been more interesting to focus entirely onAileen, go deep into her psyche, explore her immense pain, and witness the slow collapse that culminates in an almost absolute (and justified) misandry.What I did find to be a success is the way in which the protagonist is approached in an empathic manner, since it was easy to fall into stereotypes, condescension or hasty judgement. Still, I think the film fails to offer a deeper understanding of this complex character and her personality; with the experiences we see her go through and the episodes she remembers from her past, a neater portrait may have been composed. Charlize Theron offers an interpretation with some notable moments; however, I honestly thought that at times certain gestures, affectations and glances lacked naturalness. Her performance is, in general, good, but at times she needed nuances to move away from a simple characterization with a certain histrionism. Ricci, on the other hand, is very limited in her interpretation of the immature, detestable, manipulative and selfish Selby; a character who tries to transmit an false innocence that is never credible.Monster is a film that could have been much more, it's a half-shaped superficial portrait that ends up being nothing else than a vehicle for Theron to shine. A real disappointment.",4,monster
79313,"I finally crossed off another classic collecting internet cobwebs on my watchlist! Hiroshi Teshigahara's Japanese New Wave masterpiece from 1966, The Face of Another, blew me away. The film examines the dilemma of identity and the human psyche, our needs for validation, our fears, insecurities, and perhaps, most obviously, the various ""masks"" we wear in society. In essence, what does our identity consist of? The dialogue between our lead, Okuyama (played by the legendary Tatsuya Nakadai), and his psychiatrist had me glued to the screen throughout. The psychiatrist's monologue at one point, where he imagines a world where the mask is mass-produced, is particularly chilling. Okuyama's internalized debate leads to a lot of introspection, as well, as he initially firmly believes that one's face is not the most essential part of identity — it's the soul. Years later, in an interview with ScreenAnarchy, Nakadai discussed his role and offered some insight I found pretty interesting: ""In Japan, there is a teaching that the merit of a man is not his exterior, but in his heart … in the film, when [Okuyama's] exterior changes, so does his heart. So in that sense, I think even though in Japan we have this teaching … this is a very fearsome concept, that the exterior can also change the heart."" Themes aside, eye candy abounds in The Face of Another. We see frames within frames, these crazy zooms, jump cuts, X-ray imagery, etc. It's all meticulously done, from the framing to the set design (the psychiatrist's office? Amazing).I think once I rewatch this, it may be a 5/5 film for me. I noticed a lot of repetition and doubling throughout (that drives home this idea of multiple identities), and I'm sure I'll pick up on so much more the second time around. Highly, highly recommend.",8,the-face-of-another
60996,"Judgment at Nuremberg may feel like it is all too aware of its importance at times, and does feel intermittently melodramatic, but remains an important film for posterity, exploring the extent of retribution and compensation for a truly terrible act, where fault lies, and the individual personalities that lie behind it or were caught up in it in different measure. The film's masterstroke is setting up a delicate balance of characters whose backgrounds, perspectives, and guilt (even their own perception of their individual contributions to the war) are left shrouded in doubt - painted as real, but small indiscretions that contributed to a larger event that was only guided by a select few, like a house of cards or a champagne tower - before showing a devastating montage of true atrocities looming over the defendants and their excuses that is simply of a different magnitude, coming to bring it all crashing down in one fell swoop. Tracy's brow-beaten judge feels nuanced and well-realized, and Schell's award-winning take on the patriotic, pragmatic defense counsel is certainly vivid. That said, the slowly rotating camera whenever someone gives one of the film's many Oscar-baiting speeches is a bit much, and the final hour feels rather simplified that calls the film's entire direction in question, putting too explicit a justification for the action of Lancaster's Janning (and by extension, the entire German collaborator class).",6,judgment-at-nuremberg

56598,"Film Club! Film Club Ranked“Hey! Quit stalling, get back to work! Go on!”My first Chaplin film, and one of my first from this era of Hollywood. And while I don’t think I can say I enjoyed it, I do see the relevance and the social issues that it brought up at the time. It’s certainly an interesting watch anyhow, from the immediate opening of a shot of sheep intercut with workers going to work; you know what the films aims are. I like the aspect of taking down the industrial nature of the USA at this time. I liked the idea that the only speaking part is the foreman, the boss of this industry, making him seem even larger than the workers beneath him. It’s just a shame I felt like the film tried to tackle too much too quickly, it jumps from scene to scene, most lampooning a different aspect of the American culture of the time, and for me it never truly flowed well. It’s just a shame I didn’t really like the comedy. It’s no denying that Chaplin is likeable, and a master of the craft, but it’s a type of humour that just doesn’t really resonate with me. There were a few moments, especially early on in the factory setting that did raise a smile, but the rest just didn’t land for me. The music works, and does add the the humour in a few instances, but overall it gets a little repetitive. I didn’t really like the romantic side plot either, much preferring the earlier stuff set within the factory.

25989,"If there had been no newspaper strike, and mine were a lonely voice instead of an only voice, Lawrence of Arabia might now be festooned with the superlatives accorded such previous superproductions as The Best Years of Our Lives, Around the World in 80 Days, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Ben Hur. But like its almost forgotten predecessors, Lawrence is simply another expensive mirage, dull, overlong, and coldly impersonal. Its objective is less to entertain or enlighten than to impress and intimidate. It is not as stupid as The Longest Day or as silly as Mutiny on the Bounty. Some of its acting and technical effects are interesting. But on the whole I find it hatefully calculating and condescending. What baffles me about the promotion of the film is the assumption that everyone is passionately interested in T. E. Lawrence. Perhaps there is a cultural gap between generations. Lawrence was born in 1888 and died in 1935. Lowell Thomas popularized the legend of Lawrence of Arabia between 1918 and 1920. Those of us in America who grew up during the Depression had little reason to cultivate a champion of Arab nationalism as a personal idol. In my cultural adolescence I associated the name Lawrence with the initials D. H. rather than T. E. I even wondered whether my earliest literary hero had been involved in Arabia. Then I learned this was another Lawrence and that there was something disreputable about him, something that inspired veiled queer jokes. Somehow I failed to pursue the subject until quite recently—and I must concede that is one of the film's fringe benefits. The main trouble with this four-hour ordeal, two years and $13 million in the making, is that it grossly oversimplifies the murky politics of the Middle East without coming to grips with the man himself.The film begins with a short prologue re-enacting Lawrence's fatal motorcycle accident and the dedication of his bust in the crypt of St. Paul's Cathedral in London. After several of his acquaintances—some historical, some fictional-historical—have been briefly interviewed the plot flashes back to Lawrence in 1916 as a junior officer in the Maps Division of British General Headquarters in Cairo. This reverse opening suggests a possible ""Kane"" approach to the mystery of the hero—that is, a depiction of Lawrence as others saw him. However, David Lean's meticulously bloated direction and Robert Bolt's limply epigrammatic dialogue quickly dispel that notion. The strange thing about this movie is that people look smaller in rooms than they do on the desert. I am sure that Lean was trying for some bizarre caricature of officialdom to the advantage of the wild Bedouin existence, but this stylistic trick never comes off because it is both too obvious and too unpleasant. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole gives a nervous, hysterical, and at times effeminate performance that is not entirely wrong for the part but that somewhat distorts the historical magnitude of the character. For example, Lawrence's remarkable skill as a diplomat among the warring Arab factions is only vaguely suggested. Too often his image on horseback or camelback is allowed to prevail over his insight in the conference tent. His first great victory, the capture of Aqaba, is described from a towering crane as an exciting charge. The real Lawrence astutely persuaded the Turks to surrender without firing a shot. Of course a charge is generally considered more ""cinematic."" Lean's interpretation of-Lawrence's capture by the Turks is a further ""cinematic"" exploitation. Lawrence himself records that he was flogged and sodomized on that occasion. Biographers differ on the comparative traumatic effects of the torture and the perversion. B. H. Liddell Hart emphasized the awakening homosexuality, Anthony Nutting the discovery of a raging masochism. There appears to be no evidence that Lawrence was ever an overt homosexual. Terence Rattigan's Ross suggests that the Turks, with their Byzantine cunning, detected a latent homosexuality in Lawrence and brought it to the surface to destroy their prisoner as an Arab hero. This silly interpretation defies all logical, psychological, and historical probability, but it is an interpretation. Again Lean and Bolt try to have it both ways in the film. José Ferrer plays a coughing Turkish pederast to the hilt as he literally unveils his blond captive and fondles his breast. We see the hero striking his tormentor and being flogged for his pains, and then we see nothing more until Lawrence is cast out of the barracks. We never find out what happened, and an incredibly naive spectator might even assume that Lawrence was disheartened by his inability to endure torture. I find the treatment of this episode thoroughly distasteful. For one thing, it seems to be the big sales gimmick of the film. If a beautiful girl were stripped and then flogged for her resistance, the censors would be up in arms demanding an end to this immorality, and the critics would chortle about such outrageous Arabian Nights commercialism. But let a man be stripped and flogged, and we are supposed to be impressed with the seriousness of the theme. Perhaps Lawrence of Arabia is one brutal queer film too many. Perhaps I am a little weary of people telling me about the silliness of the heterosexual action in The Lovers and about the profundity of the sadism in Billy Budd. Perhaps I am just plain tired of all these ""serious"" moral films with no women in the cast. There is a calculating sickness at work here, an Anglo-American syndrome of abstract morality for men only that sickens me as a recurringly acclaimed theme of the cinema. By all means, let's bring on the girls.(Village Voice, December 20, 1962)",1,lawrence-of-arabia
27260,"“I have a mental picture of myself that doesn’t correspond to reality.”(miniseries) This was exactly what I was expecting yet also so completely different. I knew it would be an exhausting trip that would wane me psychologically, a carefully shot yet completely raw look at a divorce, but I wasn’t expecting such complexity of discussions and topics to be touched on. Scenes From a Marriage is not exactly a breakup movie, but a meditation of the large downfalls and some uphills of a relationship in its fullest form, from tedium to excitement, from lust to boredom, from fights to connections. It’s a painstaking portrait of how people change, and how they don’t, over time, seen not through their individuality but how it responds to the other person in a relationship. Is love only a secure friendship of mutual kindness or a totally unique feeling of affection that transcends the routinely hospitality of monogamy? Bergman’s clinical look on a broken marriage looks into that deeply.I think I didn’t emotionally connect to this movie, it was bleak and depressing but it didn’t make me cry. As much as I loved many of these conversations that changed from sour fights to longing and connection, I immensely disliked the character of Johann who was misogynistic and did not understand his wife at all (I wanted to stab him so bad at the end of episode 5!! how dare he do that to Marianne). Also this was just very long and intentionally tedious and dull to show the depressive state of its characters and it really made me feel depressed with no catharsis with these endless fights, so be warned if you want to watch this! A masterwork of lots of pain and maybe some love.",8,scenes-from-a-marriage

54718,"Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Lives of Others (Das Leben der Anderen) has a very serene ambience when compared to other entries in the spy genre which are usually filled with chases, action or violence for this German drama tries to paint an authentic portrait of life in East Germany and is a silent observation of human nature.Set in 1980s East Germany, the story focuses on the monitoring of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi; the secret police, and concerns an agent who's tasked to conduct a surveillance on a writer & his lover, but over the course of his duty ends up becoming too infatuated with their lives.Written & directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, The Lives of Others is crafted in an incredibly calm n composed manner, and presents the filmmaker in firm grip of the story he attempts to bring to life on the film canvas, which sounds even more astonishing when noted that it is his directional debut. And the proper execution of other aspects only work out in its favour.Set pieces & locations do evoke an authentic-looking atmosphere of East Germany. The camerawork is carefully employed as the movements are static for the most part, use of lighting & colour tones is skilfully done, and the drama is captured in fine detail. Editing unfolds its 137 minutes of runtime at a very relaxed pace, and the performances by its entire cast is simply outstanding.On an overall scale, The Lives of Others is an engaging drama that manages to create & sustain its tension amazingly well, gets better as the plot progresses, and concludes its tale in a very satisfying manner. The script is definitely its biggest strength and rest of the stuff is wonderfully handled too but its glacial pace & quietness did bother me at times. Not as rewarding as I expected it to be but definitely a work of pristine quality that deserves a broader audience.",6,the-lives-of-others

23004,"Despite all the praise, accolades, and relatability — the latter of which a plethora of viewers have found within this film… this feels contrived. Undoubtedly, this animated film in terms of content, release, and its following was crafted with good intentions. However, Hertzfeldt’s work with his annoying narration seems to think it’s too smart.Bill (Hertzfeldt) is a man who suffers from a memory disorder that affects his normal and standard life of repetitive routines. Things take a toll when he suffers from more hallucinations, which cause his mom to visit and care for him. Soon after attacking her when mistakenly thinking she was going to kill him with scissors, Bill is taken to the hospital and eventually recovers. The audience gets a glimpse of Bill’s childhood — what happened to his half-brother Randall, his mother’s growing paranoia, his stepfather leaving the family after his real father left, and the tragic history of his ancestors. All facets of this past may explain why Bill has turned out the way he is — often confused, depressed, & mundane. Will he finally see life’s beauty through its challenges?Unsure of what exactly to write about a film that tackles depression. Well, maybe not really tackle it, but almost show it off. There’s a pompous factor here that many people might disagree with and say otherwise, but guess it’s understandable why people love this flick. Preferably, in film, it’s a little better to see and relate to the suffering people experience via loss in other ways and through life’s normal proclivities, which are both good and bad. But when one crafts a movie about a guy losing his mind and propagating completely ridiculous stories of having a half-brother with metal rods for arms, a destroyed nuclear family, and ancestors who were crazy and all died by getting run over by trains, etc, etc, it just becomes ludicrous. Then again, it’s possible that these tidbits may not be true due to Bill’s condition. The dark comedy aspect of this might be the weakest element of Hertzfeldt’s animated work. Nothing was particularly funny as he might have thought. The hallucinations and hysterics, while filmed interestingly, don’t really hit home (at least for me). And the portrayal of bleakness in being stuck with one’s thoughts just don’t strike a chord. It’s understandable how other people can relate to this, though. Guess this kind of subject matter is just not relatable to me. And again, it comes off as pompous and annoying.What is this supposed to be? An attempt to make people understand this sort of mental plague? Or a way to act that others will never understand this sort of suffering? This isn’t a knock against those who endure depression, but there just might be a better way of portraying this kind of subject matter. Ultimately (and this is just personal preference) the minimal spirituality in a film like this is probably what adds to its weakness. There’s the honed in idea of being stuck in one’s mind, but there has to be a need to delve deeper than that — it would be to touch upon the soul. But of course, that’s an idea that won’t ring true or relatable for other people.For a simplistic animated film, the more positive factors are the simple human actions of forgiveness. In one scene, Bill forgives his biological father for leaving him during his childhood — a big factor in why Bill’s life turned out for the worse. And frankly, that portrayal of forgiveness is one instance that touches upon Bill’s soul. Those scenes and the time spent with his father just watching TV and sitting down together outside are the best parts. So there isn’t truly a huge lack of spirituality. But the idea that that helped Bill and fixed his problems isn’t really satisfying enough as it should be.If Bill had finally discovered the beauty of life such as the night sky, small objects, etc AFTER meeting with his father for the last time, then maybe the delivery would’ve been much better. But Hertzfeldt executes this the other way around. There needed to be final realization that life has its beauty and that would be through a troubled son meeting with his absent father and then forgiving him.Maybe a revisit needs to be put in place. Having majored in Animation in college (which honestly, more and more feels like a joke), it is refreshing to see a style rooted in simple shapes and figures in 2-D apart from the overt use of 3-D and morphing the spirit of traditional 2-D characters into computer generated form. However, Hertzfeldt telling the story using pockets across the screen isn’t all that appealing.",4,its-such-a-beautiful-day

69689,"If this really is the Soviet response to 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's no wonder they lost the Cold War.I've read a lot of others' reviews of this, and I swear I didn't watch the same movie. It starts off strong with the uniquely shot debrief sequence. The characterisations of the scientists as unemotional, logically-driven questioners in a somber search of truth felt uniquely Soviet; Kelvin and Snaut's unflappable attitude and calm toward the space station hallucinations felt similarly very Russian. The set design and the Solaris Ocean visuals were also eye-catching.Besides that, it was so deeply boring that I was continuously falling asleep; it took me three days to get through this snoozefest. It has no business being 2.5 hours long, the pacing suffers immensely from elongated scenes that add nothing to the story or feel of the film. The characters have almost no personality, and seem practically indifferent to the events of the story - Hari, the imaginary wife, is the most engaging character of the movie, and even she seems kinda bored at times. The final ending is incomprehensible and would be a meh reveal when compared to an average episode of The Twilight Zone (which, by the time of this release, had already run for five seasons).This is certainly one of the hottest entries in my list of Hot Takes and Unpopular Opinions.",2,solaris

2111,"A great procedural and a gripping thriller - with an inspired premise and a compelling final scene.It’s another Kurosawa helmed Mifune vehicle. Mifune is very good here, as a wealthy businessman who has to risk his wealth to save a kidnapped child. It’s a more pensive and restrained role, not his best but done well - limited by the character not being interrogated enough by the film.There is a lot to celebrate here: the film is broadly empathetic and the twists and turns are very well handled. It is a very slick and cool film, with great visual and solid sound. Politically, however, it’s underwhelming. It starts out with a tremendous bait and switch: the millionaire will risk it all (financially) for his son, but when he finds out his chauffeur’s son has been kidnapped by mistake, things complicate. This seemed to cut right to the centre of an illusion of equality. The child of boss and employee play together, as of equals, but one event shows the real divide. One is worth so much and one is worth nothing. Also, the film pushes that the businessman’s wealth comes from his wife - which shows as all as in positions due to luck and circumstance. Chance has privileged his son but disadvantages the other.The film takes a different direction though, which is surprising and compelling but not as thematically interesting. The money is paid and our businessman hero becomes a martyr, a celebrated figure by the press. He is sympathetic and characters even say how they thought they wouldn’t like him because he’s rich, but he’s a good man. A man of principle - which is possibly foreshadowed by his wanting to make good shoes, forfeiting short term gain for long term value. Though this is fine, it skews too closely to a centrist view of #NotAllMillionaires, which does little for me.The film is more complex than this, it is perhaps satirical that we get snapshots into real poverty and suffering - which serve only as backdrops - while the police and public focus purely on the nice millionaire. It foregrounds a political bias and an ability to ignore real suffering that may not be intentional but his powerful. We also do get an insight into the kidnapper, ultimately making him sympathetic. Also, the strict adherence to narrative theories of equilibrium (we return to the calm at the start at the end) cleverly illustrates that the rich never really fall. It all works out for the businessman, there’s never really a sense of risk, while others pay very heavy prices due to things that are really out of their control.I would give this more weight if it was sustained but the film again pushes a centrist line. It is a film that knows high exists and that low exists, and it wants you to feel for the low - but also respect the high. This would be fine but it’s always high and low, never high and therefore low.Interestingly, the opening ideas and plot movements do pre-echo Parasite, as a sharp reveal of the rigid boundaries between high and low that keep those systems in place. But the film doesn’t follow that logic. It does want us to feel for the people who are low but it frames it as a jealousy rather than a consequence. The film is too keen to present the businessman as sympathetic that it doesn’t show how, even good businessmen, do enforce poverty - due to the capitalist system we live in. This is further shown by a refusal to explore the reality of the chauffeur, who is deferent and understanding - and ultimately just a narrative piece.There are interesting ideas in here, and there is empathy, it is just that the world shown is narrow and skewed. It tells maybe the wrong stories in a great wider narrative, giving too much time to the less valuable perspectives and ignoring several important factors. Is it still good? It’s very good. As a thriller, it’s superb filmmaking and the narrative conceit is inspired. Is it more than this? Perhaps, but not as much as it could have been.",7,high-and-low

11453,"Attack On Titan Marley ArcHalf of this is Villeneuve at his most populist which means that once in a while there will be a concept so entertainingly idiosyncratic (I have to believe it comes from the book now in a toned down version) that is either genuinely moving and endearing (I really like the brief glances of romance in a Villeneuve movie!!! And Javier Bardem gives my fav performance in a Villeneuve film yet) or inherently funny against all the self seriousness at play (the fetus stuff, the Nazi Imagery, Austin Butler's Feyd-Rautha's try hard depravity that comes back to being actually intimidating in contrast/favor to all the sexual tension he shares with every single person on screen). Maybe IMAX and Greg Fraser are really bringing the best of him, despite that when it comes to edit around the coverage of these conversations it really fucks with the rhythm (guy has zero patience for anything in a movie that feels even more overpopulated than the first one) and I’m not convinced by most of the hand to hand action here (minus the ending which I quite enjoyed). The rest tho…Nothing to add to what Eduardo Valente's succinct words about Maelstrom warned us about Villeneuve two decades ago:http://www.contracampo.com.br/31/maelstrom.htm“The movie starts. Explosive, highly stylized photography. ""Cool"" music sets a dramatic scene. Voice-over narration contextualizes and declaims beautiful phrases. Intertitles appear with philosophical sayings about the plot. There's no doubt: you're in a modern film, in a cult to-order.  For those with some mileage in Mostras, the film is Canadian, supposedly very dense, when in fact, with a pinprick, it would be easy to explode their balloon full of air and pose. […] . Mark the boy's name, Villeneuve, and flee from him.Unless of course you like Podeswa, and there are a lot of people who do. It's designer cinema, the cinema that sells enormous sophistication to each shot, that wants to make the spectator feel smarter for seeing a beautiful cinematographic copy. Just forget to include any human interest, any true emotion, any urgent intention on the part of the director. He doesn't want to tell a story, he wants to show that he knows how to make a beautiful film. And the movie is beautiful, beautiful like any commercial on TV. In fact, there are several throughout the film: for car, vacuum cleaner, clothes, cell phone. The cinema of these boys is summed up like this: the human being is little more than a vase. Its function on stage is to make the picture as beautiful as possible, that's all. Compose a frame, like a scenery object.The title in Portuguese could even be called Amores Peces, why not? Just change the warm light of Mexico for the cold light of Canada, change a social-miserable theme for one of personal-bourgeois misery, and exchange little dogs for fish. Otherwise the formula is the same: use the little animals randomly to make several stories intersect, make the narrative come and go in time and show events twice from two angles, and above all light, frame and move the camera so that each shot is a genius movie in itself. Ready. The characters, the honesty, the story, the morals? Ah, no one will realize that they don't exist, they are so enraptured with the talent and genius of our ""storyteller"".That's what cinema is all about: it matters less what's in front of the camera than what's behind the talent. It's a film about the director, the photographer, the art director, the pathfinder. Ah, but until then a whole line of referential cinema like that of Tarantino and Lynch would also be expendable, right? Wrong, because the cinema of these and others has the courage to assume itself as artificial, as the pure and simple domain of image and sound, as illusions. Not here, we must be ecstatic because there is supposedly something very ""human"", important happening on the screen. There is not. The pain of being human, of being alive does not serve these films. It has to be the sublime pain, the pain with the right light in the combed hair, the pain with the exact trail. The pain that doesn't depress the audience, but the wonder of its beauty. How good it must be to suffer like these characters, to live your life. I want too. It's the worst movie made in the world today, aesthetically speaking. It is a decoy, and a decoy that sells. Congratulations to them.”",3,dune-part-two

For all the undeniable pathos and animation of Masina’s doll-like features, Fellini often uses them in La strada and Cabiria as blunt emotional instruments intended to beat the viewer into submission.”In just a couple of sentences, Rosenbaum perfectly articulated the response that so many viewers have had to Masina’s divisive performance style. She tended to play objects of pity and her busy, highly sentimental acting meant that the audience felt as though they had an obligation to cry. I have always felt a bit annoyed by films that insist upon badgering their audience into feeling bad for a character and Nights of Cabiria is guilty of wanting you to see Cabiria as the sort of fallen woman that children learn about in Sunday School. She has degraded herself by becoming a prostitute but she retains a quality of childlike innocence that is supposed to make her endearing to us. As a person who has always been resistant to the idea that innocence is better than hard-eyed realism, I was slightly revolted by Nights of Cabiria. It advances an insidious ideology and it helped to propagate the myth that women are at their most interesting when they are presented as saintly waifs who can suffer through anything. Nights of Cabiria is full to the brim with the sort of gloopy sentimentality that I might tolerate in a Hollywood woman’s picture. I think that the crucial difference lies in the fact that Fellini seems to take so much of this nonsense seriously. When Joan Crawford and Olivia de Havilland were making films about self sacrificing women, they undercut the mushiness with a touch of uniquely feminine rage. Fellini can only sit back and cry over his own brilliance. At least it looks pretty.",3,nights-of-cabiria

30217,"I have to breathe for a sec after this one.Robert Bresson does something very direct with A Man Escaped. He strips his film of all plot devices and uses only facts as his foundation. The movie is as literal as the title, we have almost no background knowledge, we know nothing of the main lead except for what we learn about him in that contained story: A prison break. His character is defined through his sharp mindedness, his acumen and creativity when it comes to craftmanship, his behavior when in contact with other people and through voiced over thoughts informing us about the personal psychological struggle he has to endure while facing the death sentence. We get no backstory, the sympathy and understanding we have for him is due to only one simple goal/motive he has: A prison break. We watch a man we don't know nothing about escape death. That's it.How we're getting told this story is as simple and stripped down as the story itself. Visuals of crafting tools out of junk and parts of objects, the camera only following the eyes and hands of the actor, is a third of what we're getting. Another third is the voice over, constantly letting us know his plans and thoughts, told in past tense, thus never letting us forget that this story already happened, he has already escaped. The last third is the sound design, and it (to my surprise) was of far bigger use than anticipated. It informs us of so much more happening around us, the shot of the eyes now have a greater meaning when turning the volume up: There are footsteps outside of the prison cell. Someone is getting closer to the door. There is a guard around that corner. Our crafting and chiseling makes too much noise. The rope crunches under (maybe too) high pressure. Here information is split up into those three cinematic devices, but the sound design is arguably the greatest aspect to raise both the film's tension and the audience's blood pressure.My first Robert Bresson and certainly not my last.",6,a-man-escaped

55900,"For years I’ve been curious about this because I knew that Reynolds broke Dick Richards’ jaw during the making of it, and that the ensuing lawsuit sent Reynolds into bankruptcy. I asked Richards once about the film, told him I hadn’t seen it and he muttered, “I only worked on Heat for a couple of weeks.” I didn’t dare ask him about Reynolds, but I did mention that I partially wanted to see it because Goldman wrote it. Richards’ response: “I thought William Goldman was so pretentious.”The film itself has a handful of strong sequences, surrounded by a lot of lesser scenes that range from dull to downright bad. Whenever Reynolds gets into insane fighting mode, it’s very entertaining. The friendship between Reynolds and Peter MacNicol’s timid millionaire is kinda moving, but it should’ve been the whole focus of the film. And those hacky final scenes are *awful*: MacNicol improbably surviving and having a cheerful last talk with Reynolds before Reynolds heads off to relax in Venice. I’m guessing other hands were brought in to cobble that bullshit ending together after too much hell broke loose behind the scenes.",5,heat

This is my first Fellini film, and what I found so fascinating is the way we are thrown into the action without the backstory, we get to figure out who Cabiria is as we go along.  There is something really special about this character, and especially actress Giulietta Masina who is absolutely captivating.  The soundtrack is really cool jazz music, and of course visually it's artfully stylish.  This is the kind of thing where you absolutely want to know more and it's ridiculously easy to watch.

80358,"A film whose many contractions held me back from enjoying much of it, though it’s exactly those contradictions that have gone some way to redeem it on reflection. The problem with this for Churchill and co was that it wasn’t propaganda enough; rather, supposedly, it was too morally knotty, too critical of the British military elite. Well, this is wartime propaganda, of a less overt and still more unnerving kind: Englishness will be preserved, the film argues, only by ditching its excesses, ie all that stuffy decorum that will hinder the fight against the Nazis. There’s an acceptance here that to win the war will mean to think more like a Nazi, and an acknowledgement that this obviously comes at a dark moral cost; thinking especially of the WWI scene where Candy’s gentle interrogation of the German prisoners is taken over by the sinister South African with no squeamishness for torture. (“I’m not a simple English gentleman. I’m a simple South African. And I can assure you that I have means to get what I want.”) We might not like it, the film says, but this is how things are done now. And this is what's being mourned at the film’s end, the necessary death of the “Blimp” mindset, risible but admirable but outmoded.This whole problem of learning to think like the enemy is complicated further — in fascinating ways I don’t think the film knows how to grapple with — by our knowledge that this older, supposedly more gentlemanly class of military men were not so dissimilar to the Nazis in the first place. The Boer War (and British colonialism more generally) casts a long shadow over the film. It’s “enemy propaganda” about the conflict that kickstarts the plot: “They're spreading propaganda all over Europe that we're killing women and children in South Africa, starving them in camps, shooting mothers, burning babies. You wouldn’t believe what they've invented.” Candy is so incensed by this accusation he’s willing to defy the orders of his superiors, go to Berlin and eventually (somewhat indirectly) risk his life in a dual over it. But it is true, we know now and they knew then, that the British did use concentration camps in South Africa. An American soldier later dismisses of the Boer War as “summer manoeuvres,” and whether or not the film “buys” Clive or the American’s perspectives on the war, the insistence on WW2 as a different kind of war entirely means that it can’t bring itself to contradict either of them. And what to make of Candy’s heartfelt assertion come the end of WWI, that “clean fighting, honest soldiering have won”? Naivety, idiocy, or denial — and on the part of Candy, or also on the part of Powell and Pressburger?",5,the-life-and-death-of-colonel-blimp
2194,"One of the biggest surprises in my tenure exploring cinema is that this trilogy didn’t live up to my heightened expectations. The Human Condition six-part epic is revered as one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time, and even though I can understand this to some extent due to Kobayashi’s fearless approach to scale and Nakadai’s increasingly impressive performance as Kaji, I’d never think about putting it on the same level as The Godfather or The Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, I don’t believe these films need to be as long as they are, and I’m simply not passionate about them. Perhaps I hit a stint of cinematic fatigue, but it is what it is. A Soldier’s Prayer at least is at the peak of my appreciation for The Human Condition. Where the first film is a grand critique of Japanese politics reminding of Paths of Glory and the second film is a dire portrait of war’s effect on the human spirit reminding of Full Metal Jacket, A Soldier’s Prayer is a final three-hour stand of survival following Kaji at his most complex state. The name of the game is to survive, through enemy lines and harsh conditions. This film is the most consistently engaging of the three with continuous pressure on the protagonists to make decisions. And Kobayashi, expectedly, shoots the difficult terrain with immense precision. I don’t love these movies and didn’t get enough out of them to sincerely praise the trilogy as some of the best I’ve seen, but it’s an undoubtedly well made set of films whether I feel rewarded for the nine and a half hours or not. Ultimately I still appreciate The Human Condition trilogy, and something like it will probably never be made again.",5,the-human-condition-iii-a-soldiers-prayer

36966,"P U R E   E U P H O R I A.Linklater positively puréed me into a Panglossian puddle with this one. This story pulsates, and I wanna pin it to Mahart.I wouldn’t consider myself a massive romantic; I’d only opt for rom-coms if my sister is within legs reach. I’d prod her till she grabs the remote and selects one, her choice is usually of the corny variation, scenes awash with pastel pinks, baby blues and replete with dainty manicures, Chihuahuas channelling Chanel, gals gilded in glitter, pouts wobbly with silicone juice, glazed with sticky gloss—lips can be likened to the smooth sheen on a Krispy Kreme. And then we have the daisy chain of trivial terrors like being forced to wear crocs or plaid, or plaid crocs? Another earth-shattering adversity is when cascading hair refuses to be tamed for THE BIG DAY—that being prom. It’s all too lah-di-dah. Now, while I may poke fun at such films, they carry their own undeniable charm.They’re highly amusing: my sister & I would giggle at the outlandish displays of affection by macho men, the perky pick-up lines received by puckered kisses, the mercurial musical numbers, and of course, the common tropes we see time & time again crop up in such sappy stories, a lot of them playfully poked at in 2019’s ‘Isn’t it Romantic’. My sister and I may hate-watch so hard that our skull sparks, but we leak empathy like a never-ending spring of bubbling crude. We’re almost always won over by the end. When you’re in a moony mood, a decent chick flick with a predictable ‘girl-meets-boy-then-eventually-gets-boy-after-unnecessary-montage-of-trials’ is enough to quench the thirst; it just does the trick.Now, I went in thinking Linklater’s very popular film, or rather, trilogy would be a rom-com of sorts, but no, this was entirely separate from the saccharine stories I occasionally sedated myself with to feel something. In place of the thrillers and gore filled lore I usually exposed my orbs to, Before Sunrise was a welcome treat—it gently snipped away at the web of guts & tendons I usually tangle myself in. Before Sunrise omits such transcendental joy, it was a viewing experience I was delightfully swept by. I didn’t want it to end—I smiled an adopted orphan‘s smile for nearly the entirety of the run time. The film somehow captured the spontaneity and initial excitement of meeting and connecting with someone new, someone you happen to be interested in. The feeling is best likened to floating; the heart, with all it’s pulsating desires is suspended to a realm extended hands can’t quite reach. And when you’re completely bowled over by someone, those pesky butterflies uncurl from their slumber in the pit of one’s belly & they flutter their frilly wings sending crashing waves of ecstasy till what you thought was complete autonomy over your body becomes a foolish notion. You’re theirs. And they’re yours. Suspended hearts defy gravity till their time with their cosmically sought companion comes to an end. However it may end.Jesse, a youthful spirit, was played wonderfully by Ethan Hawke who’s own unmistakable, boyish charm generally rubs off the characters he inhabits. Celine, a celestial kind of beauty, both whimsy & witty—the ultimate INFP (man I love me some INFP representation) was coloured to life by Julie Delpy—both were phenomenal In their respective roles.I adore that scene when they’re in the listening booth, shoulder to shoulder, stealing glances—words that wish be spoken bubble to the surface, but hesitation, a foe to fluidity, gulps down those very words. You can see their thoughts play out on their faces; the slow digestion of the spontaneity of their situation, and of course, the palpable attraction. Why can’t we just say what we want to say?  Maybe we choose to refrain lest our emotion-fuelled statements tumble out agape mouths like a plea— like a shaking cup in a beggar’s hand.Overall the film was very atmospheric. Vienna was a city that throbbed like a heartbeat or like a stadium at an early 70s Stones concert, it teemed with drunken humanity, and small moments in which a poem or palm was read were fun to watch—the following back & forth conversations about the legitimacy of the offhand gifts tickled me.The spaces they inhabited saw the molecules in the air change and their crackling chemistry brightened up the worn out, cobbled streets they strolled on. They were absolutely adorable in dimly-lit cafes, fingers interlocked, telling each other, rather endearingly how much they appreciated one another’s company. I wondered if I might do such a thing with my significant other till i’m old and grey—sit in cafes, crumbling. Sipping coffee while our hair thins, and our waists spread like spilled water over bodies we probably never liked much anyway.As Jesse & Celine’s magical night inches towards a close, they lay there, gummy, dazed, and amazed. Mouths shimmy into smiles, but upon the realisation that they may not see each other again, or forever live to recapture their time together, we see our beloved fictional duo slip into a quiet sorrow. It’s a seesaw of emotions, one I felt as though I shared with them.Their meet cute made me yearn for connection, period. Especially since I felt starved of it, you know, with the pandemic and all. But such precautions were and are necessary to protect each other. Friends & family each exhibited different levels of caution, they waved and talked from the new distance; it was like we were all flagging in a plane. It was an anxious time, and I, for a chunky period lost the will to do anything. Paranoia crept in on little rat feet, and In that way, the world had narrowed, in tiny increments and refusals, until suddenly I inhabited a series of indistinct, alien days.It may sound corny, but Before Sunrise breathed life back into me, invigorated me in a way that I desperately needed. Reassured me that there are experiences to be had, opportunities to grasp onto, I mean, I’m in my 20s for goodness sakes.In trying to grow and learn more about myself, the most hard-hitting, life-changing realisations I’ve had boiled down to something as profound sounding as ‘live-laugh-love’ (Insert wall decal). What I’ve realised is that most of us see those cliche sayings in a vacuum—a year ago, if someone had said the most important thing is love, I would have agreed conceptually, sure, but as I grow up and learn some capital L lessons, that off-hand sounding statement actually captures a lot of things I’ve learnt. These cliches are like placeholders, and well, Jesse and Celine did just that...live, laugh, love, y’know?I want to thank my lovely Letterboxd pal @Cine_addict for writing about the trilogy so beautifully & passionately; his carefully crafted reviews pushed me to give it a watch!

It’s the alien!” For Parasite’s goriest scene, we get a pretty grisly recreation of Ridley Scott’s 1979 breakthrough. Of course, there’s an irony to Stan Winston cutting his chops on this 3D-shot sci-fi/horror since he’d go on to not only become an effects legend, but create the effects for one of the greatest sequels of all time. The problem with Parasite is that its ambitions can’t match its budget. Set in a post-nuclear war America where cash is wallpaper, gold and silver act as currency, and gas prices are pretty much where we’re headed now - 40 bucks a gallon?! - the screenplay drops dozens of fascinating, mostly unseen details about an evil corporation controlling the government, the lack of electricity, fresh food, and the existence of slave-like work camps which sound like hell on earth. We’ve got lasers, slick cars with DeLorean doors, but everything else pretty much comes off as a slum town where the factory closed down and the jobs dried up.  In his third feature, producer and director Charles Band embraced what the public wanted: blood, gore, nudity, and monsters. To drive this point home, a very odd lady in the beginning – who appears to be on the verge of rape but turns out to be into it? – remains topless for the entire post-credit scene after a freaky, wordless opening. A buncha punks run roughshod over our infected doctor hero and husky-voiced, pre-stardom Demi Moore – described as Miss Lemon Grove of 1992 – all while a ruthless government agent named Wolf pursues the doc and his biological weapon, namely the parasites. Fade-outs are clunkily inserted and entire scenes feel missing. The doc gets beaten up by the local toughs, but the transition into Demi Moore’s house is way too abrupt. Ditto a scene where he leaves the house, we have no idea what he gets up to, and then he comes back and has figured out the answer to destroying the parasites. The science is also pretty dubious since he takes some parasite blood, dribbles it into sound device, and whammo, he’s ready to roll. He also recovered mighty quickly after his stomach bursts from the inside. Character motivations are also confused, like a local proprietor who's assaulted by the punks, but kindly harbors them when one of their own gets infected. The only one appearing to have any fun is James Davidson as the ruthless agent and this was his last movie! There are a few mild gross-out bits, but unless this one’s willing to romance crusty ol’ flop house proprietor (and former showgirl) Vivian Blaine, it’s probably best to leave Parasite outside.",3,parasite

He's basically never let me down until this film and Dodeskedan.It's just some soldiers try to survive the wilderness while a man who's in tune with nature guides and protects them. Not much room for anticipation, humor, and humanism; none of the main trademarks of Kurosawa's work.

58832,"Finally got myself to watch this classic movie and I really enjoyed it. Before I start sharing any of my opinions on this thing, I do have to say that I absolutely understand that this film was HUGE for its time and I really appreciate it for that. I think the experience of watching this opening night back in 1979 is better than anyone else ever had with this film, but I sadly didn’t get that. Now my review on the film!Alien is just such a special movie which, tbh, I’m not really sure how to review. The building atmosphere, the fantastic set designs, the amazing visuals, everything about this film is just so cool and good. It’s a pretty slow movie imo where actually, not that much stuff happens, but it’s still super interesting. And like I already said, I grew up in the 21th century, where every week a new sci-fi movie releases. Besides from that, this movie still really interested me, which says quite a lot. There are so many huge scale sci-fi products out there, but they didn’t intrigue me as much as this small-scale classic. That alone deserves a huge praise. The cast here is really great, Sigourney Weaver is incredibly iconic as Ripley and just delivers a badass performance. The supporting characters were fun too, although I kinda felt like most of em were there to get killed. I do also have to talk about the fantastic Xenomorph design bc I love every single thing about it. It’s just so cool, unique and original. I just really love all the lore it had, and I’m pretty sure I’ve only seen a small part of it too. It made the entire film just so much more interesting, with the alien evolving and stuff. Not fully showing the Xenomorph till the third act is also just an incredibly smart choice that really builds up the tension and fear. Like I already said, I do think this movie is very slow, maybe a bit too slow for my likings. Especially the first half felt like it just really took its time to start up. This definitely fits the vibe of the movie and the world building surely was cool to see. But, I have to be honest, bc I always am. I felt a bit bored during the first hour, and don’t get me wrong I FULLY blame it on myself and my fucked up attention span. I truly see that this is a masterpiece, although it might be slow, which ofc doesn’t mean it’s not good. I just find myself enjoying the final product a bit less (bc the first hour bored me at moments) and that’s just a shame. But just to make sure one last time, it’s not bc of this movie’s quality!! So overall I really had a good time with Alien, it’s an incredibly cool and unique piece of film that truly did so much for the sci-fi and horror genre! Sigourney Weaver is an absolute badass, the Xenomorph is unbelievable and all of the huge set designs looks immaculate. I think this movie is a masterpiece, but my rating sadly won’t go higher than 4/5 stars (for now). Some people might not understand that but I just rate mostly on enjoyment and not on quality! I get why people adore this as much as they do, wish I could rate it higher but in the future I probably will. 81/100",7,alien

Even though the majority of this is dialogue, whenever they were discussing the procedure, I felt slightly nauseous at how they were planning to do the abortion.The beginning of this was slightly hard to follow, but it found its footing whenever they introduced the man that was going to do the procedure in this.  I was actually on the man’s side as he was getting frustrated with the women for not following directions.  As he began to question them even more about her medical history, and it became apparent that a lot of the information that he was given was not honest, I expected him to bail on the whole thing.  Whenever he said what he wanted the payment to be, I was like, “Fuck this asshole!” And realized that this was taking an even darker turn.After the procedure was over, I felt like I was kind of in a daze.

63074,"Pretty, but it's a shell. Wonderful material for video essay B-roll & Twitter screencaps but rarely atmospherically compelling. Also politically disingenuous. All expression of care about oppression of the poor is hokum, and the moral that progress arrives due to the unity of upper and lower classes... uhh,You can make a great film with politics I dislike, but that just feels lame, and in the context of the story/history, extremely dangerous. It perpetuates anti-revolutionary capitalist centrism that, a few years after the film's release, enabled Hitler's rise to power, and the film further supports reactionary paranoia/conspiracy theories that revolution was a ploy by ""undesirables"" who already ran parts of society and would actually harm the working class, which, in Germany, contributed to existent bigotries, especially antisemitism, and allows for ruling institutions to consolidate power through fear. Note that the false prophet is a sexually unapologetic woman, and her creator a thinly-veiled antisemitic caricature. Lang himself was Jewish, yes, but working with a script by Von Harbou, a literal Nazi, and within the German film industry... it's absolutely in there.The film is fascist. The fact it pretends to care for the proletariat does not change that, that's a very very common fascist ploy. You can argue it's politically compromised or muddled but has redeeming factors, and I respect it. I think it's just fucking lying that it cares.",1,metropolis
11444,"it personally pains me to disagree with my darling princess Emma Chantiri, but I can't stress just how aggressively Not My Vibe™ this is.scales ever upwards in a quest for moments, for the capital S spectacle, for these Big scenes supposedly laced with Profound themes, as it leaves character, motivation, relations, even conflict to the wayside, to twist, dissolve, and dissipate back into the blank desert like granules of sand on a balmy day. Dune 2 begins promisingly enough with an attempt to situate us in the Fremen, their customs, their peoples, their disdain, their inter group frictions, as Paul and Lady Jessica find themselves interrogating their own motives even as they move inexorably, cruely, towards destiny, but then 35 minutes and a set piece later any real interest and intrigue besides brief lingers are speed-ran to a slab of dreck slowly careening along the dressings of a tragic religious epic. performances run a range acrosss solid to unambitious with few exceptions—Rebecca Ferguson is consistently great, Florence Pugh could make watching paint dry a compelling action, and Austin Butler is having a grand old time playing the strange, snarling love child of Mick Jagger and Voldemort—but any issues of acting are merely compounded by a pulseless screenplay and uninvigorating direction. Paul's messianic ascent is an arc of reluctance to vehement arrogance told abruptly and barely shown, Lady Jessica undergoes a complete transformation of identity we're never made privy to outside the manic conversations she has with Anya Taylor Zygote, Chani is half-baked, half-conceived, a half-thing made of suspicious scowls and loving smiles that Zendaya's mighty charisma can't even save, and the less said about the central romance the better. Denis Villaneuve pitches colossal images insisting upon their gravitas at every turn within the sort of sweeping epic reliant on how the characters are affected by the deep consequences of these conspiracies, the power plays, the interpersonal dynamics, the gearing up to holy war (but not the j word, never the j word), yet doesn't do the work necessary to support that. visuals take precedence, image is apogee and apex, and the storytelling falters as a narrative about the toil of war and how colonial forces shape mythology to their whim as a means of subjugation conflicts with visuals that valorize a false prophet and his crusade of vengeance. thus, Dune 2 stumbles confusedly against the brick wall of its metaphors as it ever implores our care while it trips in justifying it, shuddering with enormous physicality while foresaking the emotionally integral, and I would say more, I could continue waxing on about this but I hesitate to do so about a work for which my cultural background is foundational to but not spotlighted.it's infuriating to watch throngs of nerds, critics, and audience goers heap praise on a film such as this as if a new benchmark for sci-fi, for its dense lore, exotic score, exquisite costumery, whatever and what have you but leaving legitimate concerns by Middle Eastern and North African peoples about the fetishization of our cultures in the film adaptation of a book famously, heavily, influenced by Islam and MENA communities out and by the wayside.with Arab and Amazighi representation in the West being the way that it is (next to virtually nonexistent if not stereotypical and lacking), a film series like Dune could've provided a massive launch pad for MENA creatives to get a boost in the industry— future roles, future positions, the networking opportunities—yet neither film involved any Middle Eastern or North African (save one, Souheila Yacoub as Shishakli) in major production or cast besides a few extras without lines, despite Villaneuve and writer Jon Spaihts making a big deal to newspapers about ""the Arab world being a part of us"" when asked about the change of ""Jihad"" to ""holy war"", despite Herbert's novel being directly inspired by the Algerian war of Independence against the French, despite Dune only existing in the way it does because of the Quran, Islamic teachings, and the Arabic language.it is a special kind of vile how these movies profit off of a cultural non-specificity while vulture picking us apart, transfiguring our tangible realities—our style of dress, our faith, our practices, our hospitality, respect, and reverence—into aesthetics to put on and discard once the press tour's over, in Stilgar doing sujood in his prayers and warning Paul to fear the Djinn in the desert, in the Fremen hilariously speaking improperly pronounced Arabic in the most confident of tones, in an anti-colonial story getting twisted to a vacuous mass of mass appeal when we, as I've reiterated across many of my reviews in the past few months, are live witnessing MULTIPLE GENOCIDES of indigenous Arab and African populations.and in the coming days, as many of us prepare for Ramadan to fast, abstain from impurity, and connect with our families while millions of Palestinians and Sudanese peoples are forced into starvation and deprived of basic resources by genocidal offensives—paid for by our tax dollars—I wanna urge all of you reading right now to think critically on the media you consume, on your relationship to your MENA and Muslim friends, to acknowledge our critiques, our takes, and our praises more, and to maybe check out and support our media representation more as well.so, with all that said: a big fuck you to Denis, I hope you get eaten by a sand worm!

57614,"Call me a philistine, but Michelangelo Antonioni's La Notte is precisely the kind of bullshit that makes me so sceptical towards arthouse cinema. Everything about it - the cinematography, the performances, the soundtrack - just reeks of the delusional, overblown nonsense masquerading as ""high-minded"" art that directors like Antonioni spent the mid-20th century patenting. I don't think my feelings towards this film would be half as strong if it, and Antonioni's work in general, weren't so damn celebrated. What is it that everyone sees in stuff like this? Get a grip, people. La Notte centres on a married couple, Giovanni and Lidia Pontano. Giovanni is a famous author; Lidia is not. At the start of the film they pay a visit to their dying friend in hospital. Lidia leaves early, and Giovanni, departing a few minutes later, has a brief and abortive sexual encounter with a female patient who throws herself upon him. He quite understandably tells Lidia about this - a good marriage has no secrets, after all - then wishes he hadn't. A rift is opened up between him and Lidia, which is best seen in the fact that Lidia seems no longer to want to spend time with him. She wanders around Milan alone, and then, when the pair go to a late-night party, wanders around the hosts' large house alone. Left to his own devices, Giovanni sets about seducing the hosts' daughter, Valentina, while Lidia allows herself to be pursued by another guest. Over the course of the night, these characters wander their way towards self-realisation.The film is the second in Antonioni's ""trilogy on modernity and its discontents"", slotting in between L'Avventura and L'Eclisse. I confess to having actually liked L'Avventura: I thought it was really clever how Antonioni conjured a mood of disaffection and subverted the audience's expectations in the process, turning an ordinary mystery into a study of bourgeois ennui in which the protagonists' underlying motivation for every action was the need to satisfy their sex drives. Well, lightning never strikes twice. What we get with La Notte is an attempt to repeat the formula that quickly degenerates into a clumsy shambles. The sight of Antonioni scrabbling around for some semblance of thematic and emotional weight is glorious fun for the sadist in me, especially since the director has done everything in his power to deprive himself of weight in the first place. Let's take things one by one, shall we?Firstly, there's the fact that his two protagonists hail from the intelligentsia rather than the bourgeoisie. What does this give Antonioni to critique? In L'Avventura his objective was flagging up the rejection of the intellectualism that Giovanni and Lidia espouse. The party they attend is hosted by a businessman in his ugly modernist mansion: surely, with their background, they'd be perfectly placed to turn their noses up at the tastelessness of the industrialist class? Yet over the course of the film, we see Giovanni merge with this crass milieu, as if he's one of them at heart. This, I'm tempted to assume, speaks to some kind of internalised snobbery on Antonioni's part. Here he is, emphasising how those who embrace intellectualism are in the same boat with those who reject it, but he himself is a part of that pro-intellectual set (if you doubt me on this, bear in mind that he's an artist, and all artists, with the exception of the unambiguously populist ones, tend to be intellectuals). But I don't think Antonioni would be so deliberately hypocritical. It seems to me a simple case of a filmmaker, starved of original ideas, flinging together something that looks and sounds like it has a statement to make and hoping no one notices how counter-productive the results have accidentally ended up being.Then there's the matter of how stylistically phony the whole thing is. The cinematography has that typical Antonioni trait of framing its characters in a manner that puts them at one remove from their surroundings, suggesting, through the use of decor and depth of field, their ""alienation"". How unique. The director of photography was Gianni Di Venanzo, who two years later shot Federico Fellini's 8½ - a film so markedly superior to this one, not only thematically but visually, that the fact that they share a cinematographer barely makes any sense. His work is just so flat here, so lacking in dynamism, that to be honest it's perfectly suited to a film that lacked anything stimulating to drive its visuals to begin with. The absence of non-diegetic music means Antonioni allows himself to use diegetic jazz music - the snob in him equates such music with a bourgeois lack of taste. And at the centre is a trio of emotionally frigid performances from three of the most recognisable European stars of the age: Jeanne Moreau, Monica Vitti and, in a casting fluke, the congenitally jaded Marcello Mastroianni. In fairness, the screenplay does them zero favours, forcing amorphous Existential waffle out of their mouths that doesn't even bother approximating how real people speak and think.So there you have it. La Notte is entirely bogus, cynically aware that its target audience will ascribe to it any ""meaning"" they can possibly pin to its messy structure, rambling plot, dialogue that is at once evasive and unrealistically soul-searching, and imagery that strains so hard for bold innovation that it circumvents imaginativeness altogether. This is not the cinema that matters. The cinema that matters speaks to the emotional reality of life as lived, and not as mangled and warped into the kind of hollow trash that everyone loves to claim it isn't.",1,la-notte
84137,"idk if i have any large overarching thoughts yet so once again it is time for a scattered list!!!!!!!!!!!!!- truly goofy sex scenes. why is florence pugh taking a break from riding cillian murphy to pull a sanskrit book off his shelf and making him read it to her? AND absolutely smoothbrained to have her point at a random line, say, ""read it"" and it's literally ""i am become death, destroyer of worlds"" like fuck offffff with your obvious shit lol- no character in this movie is developed very deeply beyond the guy himself but florence pugh being here just to show tits and be a communist then die because apparently she's also unspecifically mentally ill is like....how are we still this bad at character christopher!!! when will you learn that a girlie hating flowers does not count as depth!!!! - last flo-related point but whoever decided cillian murphy should have his legs crossed in that scene is a coward- many weird and funny cameos but i think my favorite is rodrick rules himself bent over a bike vomiting with snot pouring out of his face. - bitch i love to see david krumholtz in a movie!!! my king!! you were so good in LEOPOLDSTADT!!!- sound mix is actually dreadful. too bass-heavy and muddled and often dominated by music to an extent that i kept missing what people were saying—and besties this movie is talky as fuck and full of quantum physics jargon, you gotta help me out a little bit here by making sure i can at least decipher everything that's being said. idk what happened here!- something very funny to me about my screening is that i was sitting second row in an imax for this movie and one of the trailers that played beforehand was for this paul giamatti alexander payne movie that ends with a freeze frame of paul giamatti, and i think because the movie is not supposed to be in imax, it cut off giamatti's head at the top and bottom so it showed him in close-up from eyebrows to chin just frozen mid-scream, and it held on his face for like 10 seconds and it was so scary to me that i never reached that level of adrenaline during any other point of OPPENHEIMER. - honestly? i was skeptical about RDJ even being in this movie but i thought he was excellent! his persona simply melted! benny safdie? doing too much i'm afraid! matt damon? maybe not doing enough? love to see dane dehaan out here wearing some little glasses.idk the sound mix was so annoying that after a while i started treating it like a music video that was occasionally interrupted by hearings and testimony and people shouting about atoms. the way this is structured and edited seems like nolan is so afraid of people being bored by it, it's absolutely frantic and not in a way that i find compelling (that way being like how orson welles cut THE TRIAL or F FOR FAKE or even THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WIND). the editing overall is totally overwrought, desperate to cover all things said and all people saying them, while also, like, having whole exchanges that are cut shot-reverse with totally disorienting 180-jumps that don't feel intentional even a little bit?? which is not me saying ""i know better than to do this"" so much as it feels some scenes were very intentionally shot and edited and other parts of this feel like it was trimmed within an inch of its life to get to that 180-minute runtime. so i guess i'm arriving at some kind of overarching thought finally which is that i didn't feel much of anything about this but i certainly wasn't bored. movie interesting! landing on ""you have started a chain reaction that will destroy the world"" is uhh a cool place to leave my brain considering the world is on fire constantly now and i'm always thinking about how we're all going to die from climate change eventually but yeah idk. i enjoyed the AC this afternoon.",4,oppenheimer-2023

It's definitely ambitious in terms of a 3 hour chaotic epic about the nature of life or something and I hope Paul got a good grade on this art project. Just didn't really appeal to me all that much: a bunch of scripts for dramas that you would've forgotten already if they were all separate films mushed together for 3 hours of ""life's a downer, man."" Performances are good, I'm really impressed by the quality of this who's who of late 90's-early 2000's drama stars, but this writing is so dry with way too much ""f-bomb"" spice added. Some highlights occassionally, I really like Spencer's story because ""America fucking hates children"" is a fascinating topic to me, but the way I would describe this is the idea of the ending multiplication effect (Yes, I am citing the Plinkett reviews. Welcome to my page of postmodernist film criticism written by a moron.) but instead it's the film multiplication effect. Even the first scenes are exhausting and I got really sick of that ""one is the loneliest number"" song really quick.

39359,"The fourth film in my Ken Bowes curated Hirokazu Kore-eda side bar in my COVID-19 home film festival came on the day when my local library opened for borrowing again. I have my next week planned out already (and five more Kore-edas to go), but it is good to know that the amazing collection at Port Phillip has opened up again. While this film continues Kore-eda’s fascination with death and loss and grief (and clouds), it is much more personal than his previous films have been. In an interview in the extras, he says that he began writing the first script treatment for a film with this title in the late 1990s but shelved it to make Nobody Knows (2004).  After the death of his mother in 2006, he substantially reworked his screenplay to portray a period of a little more than 24 hours in the life of the extended Yokoyama family in the Yokohama area to the south of Tokyo.The parents who live in the Yokohama house are Kyohei (Yoshio Harada), a retired doctor, and his wife, Toshiko (Kirin Kiki).  The family has gathered together, as they do annually, to mark the 12th anniversary of the death of their eldest son, Junpei, who drowned while saving the life of a local boy, Yoshio (uncredited), who drops by to pay his respects, as he has done each year.  The two surviving children travel to the reunion with their families. Ryota (Hiroshi Abe), an art restorer, brings his wife Yukari (Yui Natsukawa), a widow who he recently married, and her pre-teen son, Atushi (Shohei Tanaka).  Ryota’s sister, Chinami Kataoka (You), comes with her husband, Nobu (Kazuya Takahashi) and their two pre-teen children.While Kore-eda says that his mother was the model for Toshiko, down to several of her family stories and sayings making it into the screenplay, the other characters are less directly drawn from him and his family members.The ebb and flow of a family reunion (my family Christmas Day is an apt comparison) is captured perfectly by cinematographer Yutaka Yamazaki and the sound team.  Kore-eda gets the editing credit and there are several occasions where the pieces of information that fill in the back story occur as people are speaking over each other or where two scenes separated chronologically during the day need to be linked. The discussion about a special song in a relationship which seems innocuous, except that Kyohei starts chopsticking food into his mouth at a rate of knots when Ryota plays the record for Toshiko, turns out to have a totally unexpected significance we only find out about much later in the day.It is small snippets of information like this that expose the undercurrents in what, on the surface, looks like a model family.  Toshiko, who seems to be the perfect grandmother, cooking favourite dishes for her children and grandchildren, turns out to be a master at the sly dig, and is seemingly willing to wait years for the perfect time to put the boot in, always with a smile. Ryota knows he can never live up to his father’s expectations and has been using avoidance for years rather than standing up for himself. The coda suggests that Yukari coming into his life may just have moved things forward for him.In the interview with Kore-eda, he says that making the film was an important part of coming to terms with the death of his mother and, of all his films, it is the one he can now re-watch dispassionately. I was also fascinated by his reflection that he would now not include the voiceover from Ryota that links the parents walking home after farewelling him and his family and the coda, which clearly occurs several years later, on the basis that it is superfluous.  Even though we have seen the earlier scene of Ryota and Toshiko visiting Junpei’s grave, I am not sure that I could have worked out the information conveyed in the voiceover based only on the visuals in the coda.At just under two hours and with no real action, the time still flies by as we get to know the characters and their relationships and begin to understand what is happening in the undertow.  I was interested to hear Yamazaki talking about working with Kore-eda and he closes the circle on something that was niggling at me after seeing the earlier three films.  He explains how what is important for Kore-eda is not just what is in the frame (and how it is framed) but what is just outside of the frame.  It seems to me that applies equally to elements in the sound design of things that we never see on the screen but which contribute to the strong sense of realism Kore-eda is so good at creating.The Criterion Collection DVD extras are video interviews with Kore-eda and with Yamazaki; a “Making of” documentary showing Kore-eda at work; and a booklet containing an essay by film critic Dennis Lim and four recipes for the food prepared in the film by Toshiko.  You also get a strong feel for Kore-eda’s sense of humour, which was very evident in his Q&A in Melbourne for the Australian premiere of The Truth (2019) last November - his wandering off from the set to check out something that has caught his interest, his precise instructions for making corn tempura exactly as his mother used to make it and, my personal favourite, his sucking in You and Natsukawa to believing that Hirokazu Kore-eda is a pseudonym.Thanks again Ken Bowes for the loan of these films.  Being able to watch them in chronological order is an added bonus.",9,still-walking

26732,"God, what an oppressive film. Two people in a failing relationship have a way of sucking the life out of a room, and it’s an experience that Asghar Farhadi faithfully replicates for the viewer. An accurate artistic vision, surely. It makes for something of a slog, though. The story isn’t so much the tragedy of something being lost as it is the tail end of a death march. Any joy that may have existed between Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) has been ground into dust years before the opening scene, which sets the theme from the start as a collection of people simply running out the clock before the inevitable. Nader’s senile, barely present father is the avatar of this inexorability, the incalculable weight at the center of a black hole pulling everyone into it, no hope of escape in evidence. I respect the willingness to commit this concept to film but it makes for a tiring experience much of the time. Razieh’s (Sareh Bayat) excruciatingly feckless attempts at caretaking seem to stretch for hours, driving home the full impact of the albatross around Nader’s neck. Much of the film is punctuated by bureaucracy and waiting around in crowded, soporific courtrooms as the story’s action grindingly proceeds. It’s no Kafkaesque descent into madness by any stretch. Characters occasionally crack jokes to break up the overwhelming boredom while a judge fortifies himself with tea and rubs his eyes at the endless parade of bullshit. The scenes seem to be suffused with the spirit of the “eh, what can you do” shrug. All of that adds up to a pretty crushing coming of age for Termeh (Sarina Farhadi), who gets her first taste of adulthood through the universal lesson that one’s parents, being humans, are capable of being committed shitbirds. Of all the characters, she’s the only one who ever seems surprised at the general downward trajectory of things, a privilege reserved in this world for the young. There’s nothing in the film that doesn’t ring true, which is the sign of a perceptive artist at the helm.

49347,"65I feel like Larry David when I say that Everything Everywhere All at Once is pretty, pretty, pretty good. Certainly not surprised to find out that the latest Daniels picture has a similar vibe to SNL digital shorts and late-2000s era YouTube. The quirky humor is incessant, and often overbearing, but luckily it's more of a means to an end, with many of the comedic ideas eventually woven into the emotional canvas. Swiss Army Man had the advantage of a whimsical simplicity, like an obscene fairy-tale in the forest, whereas EEAAO is determined to expand until it bursts across the cosmos. It's grand and messy and eager to please, with a dash of freshman year existentialism for good measure. With such a happy-go-lucky approach to its vision, and gags and references pushing to the extreme with reckless abandon and ingenuity, it's thrilling to uncover the complexity of these characters. That is what made the movie stick for me. Michelle Yeoh, Stephanie Hsu, James Hong, Jamie Lee Curtis, and fucking Ke Huy Quan (especially great to see him in such a romantic role). It's an ensemble that rises to the task and then some. Their enthusiasm and fervor for the material smooths over a ton of annoying shit.",6,everything-everywhere-all-at-once

(and who said that sex itself isn’t wholesome?) so yoko can shout 1 corinthians 13 in hugely emotional close-up over beethoven’s seventh but we know the love of which she speaks isn’t patient or kind or anything paul wrote about it. that’s not the love a cult can give you, and it’s not the love that guilt-based religion can give you. and, you know, it’s not exactly the love that yu has for her, either. but he hears that love never fails, or at least never falls in ruins, and interprets that over and against the zero church’s idea of love, which is a huge start, and honestly, if he now knows only in part, then he will know fully, even as he is fully known.",7,love-exposure

39307,"[64]Functions between two vastly opposite modules : [1] beautifully realized and exceptionally observational verisimilitude, and [2] pesky cleavages of painfully forthright melodrama. The first, I love; the second, not so much. This is a quiet “family drama” that ironically excels in the total absence of drama—when things are at their least climactic and agitated. The inconspicuous, unassuming details were what kept me enthralled: afternoon food preparations; private pre-arrival advisories that are necessary when introducing someone new to the family (on both ends); reminiscing about fried corn cakes; children projecting a continuous stream of joyous background noise while adults chat, post-dinner; even the way the wife prepares for bed, makeup-less, slapping lotion against her neck and cheeks while consoling her child as the father walks in, mid-conversation, aloof but ready to play along, culminating in a gentile, genuine laugh shared by this insular family unit. No coincidence that almost none of these moments involve the deceased brother, a topic of initial non-discussion whose unwelcomed allusions become more and more frequent as the night marches on. Some of the consequential shards are quite revealing (e.g. the seemingly sweet but secretively Machiavellian grandmother, buried in a wholesome façade while extorting the most passive-aggressive form of torture I’ve ever witnessed) while others reek like a week-old ham sandwich (e.g. the Yellow Butterfly / “don’t kill his reincarnation!” sequence), especially when sprinkled against a canvas that otherwise thrives with nondrama. To put it bluntly: the more Junpei is brought up, the more I found myself retreating towards a state of disinterest. (It becomes slightly worse once the older sister and dopey brother-in-law / children leave for the night, as it removes the main source of mediation, the remaining quintet left to slip into miserable brooding with no easy means to recover.) But then grandma and grandpa start playfully bickering about each other’s bad habits and I find myself enamored by the minutiae all over again, at least until the next time Ryota starts noticeably moping about thinking he’s the “less successful brother that should have died instead.” (Admittedly not too big on the noodling, made-for-the-Nature-Channel musical inserts, either, but that's a minor quibble.)",6,still-walking

13577,"Film #1000Watching The Passion of Joan of Arc is like pouring over a Renaissance altarpiece for 80 minutes while some of the best sacred music you've ever heard is performed in the same church (if you use the Voices of Light soundtrack by Richard Einhorn, as did I). The raw emotion on display is absolutely breathtaking, not only from Joan but from her judges and her supporters as well. Maria Falconetti goes through so many emotions, from fear to determination to wavering to hope to anguish to joy, and the stark closeups of her face combined with her masterful expressivism drags the viewer through each one of these emotions with her. But Falconetti is not the only one putting on an emotional acting masterclass. You get to see her various judges breakdown, one by one, until seemingly all but the English soldiers are on her side. The judges' expressions shift from easy-going confidence to astonishment, anger, self-doubt, and ultimately compassion as each one is slowly convinced of Joan's righteousness and must confront his own part in falsely condemning her to the stake. And all of this conveyed without the benefit of the spoken word, using dialogue largely taken straight from 15th-century transcripts of Joan's actual trial! Hence my comparison to a Renaissance masterwork. The story, the emotion, the message, the power of the film must be conveyed entirely visually, and Dreyer packs more visual power and beauty into this film than I have ever seen in any other work.But all the visual power in the world would be merely a resounding gong or clashing cymbal if the story behind it did not have great power of its own. This story combines one of the most powerfully tragic events of the Middle Ages (the trial and martyrdom of Joan of Arc) with elements of the greatest story ever told - the Passion of Christ. The spiritual significance of this story is profound. Joan's faith in God's promises are severely tested from every possible angle. She is intellectually browbeaten, physically assaulted, threatened with torture and death, and even spiritually abused through the withholding of the Eucharist and the treachery of the priest who pretended to be sent by King Charles. She suffered many indignities and withstood them almost to the last. Her one slip-up comes at a moment of severe coercion, persuasion, and public vulnerability, but as soon as she is back in her cell she sees her martyr's crown being swept away from her due to her infidelity and immediately goes back on her renunciation, seeing the promises of freedom and victory that she had hoped for as coming in strange and yet powerful ways - death and martyrdom. At this point her sincerity and innocence is clear, and she is given viaticum - something that would in every case be denied a relapsed, unrepentant heretic and apostate. Her very judges, those who condemn her to die, recognize the falsity of the charges they brought against her and by their actions bear witness against their own sin. Joan's heroism and fidelity are present to the last, as she clasps the cross of Christ to her breast even while at the foot of her stake. So many aspects of her trial are reminiscent of her Lord's. She is falsely accused, spat upon, betrayed by false witnesses, and even crowned and mocked in her cell. She remains largely silent in the face of her accusers, answering their shouted and angry questions with simple, profound answers. They nail a plaque of her charges above her stake, and even the stake itself, raised above the crowd, gives the appearance of Calvary. Watching Dreyer's incredibly evocative imagery, I instantly saw the influence he had on Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ and its own powerful visual style. Dreyer's incredible visuals are not absent for a single frame, and the symbolism packed into this film will take several rewatches to completely unpack.This film is a must-watch for any Christian cinephile. Its deep spiritual significance and raw visual power demand frequent viewings over many years to fully unpack. Be faithful to Christ, and your vindication and your reward will be greater than your wildest imagination.",9,the-passion-of-joan-of-arc

Maybe it's the idea of this Russian novel-made-English coupled with the fact that the acting feels so much like a Western. Henry Fonda makes Pierre Bezukhov sound like a cowboy in a John Wayne movie. Mel Ferrer's Prince Andrei sounds like the urbanite who has come to the frontier. Some of the women, noticeably Andrei's wife Lise, sounds like she's putting on a British accent (yet she's an Italian actress). And then you've got Audrey Hepburn's voice, full of manic energy as Natasha. Nothing feels right about this, and there's over 200 minutes of it! King Vidor's version pales in comparison to Bondarchuk's magnum opus, which doesn't feel as over-long as Vidor's movie despite it being double the running time.

Certainly my favorite Greek drama and a big possibility my favorite Greek film period.Two kids are searching for their father. They start a long journey. They are positive about it, excited to find their dad and at the same time hyped they are gonna leave the place the live at the moment. In fact they are that excited that as we learn they start this journey everyday. They never go too far, but they are excited to start again.They are alone. All they have is each other and the idea of their father. They write letters to him the whole time. They express their thoughts, their feelings, the way the view their journey and other people in general.They stumble upon Orestis who is there for them and help them, Their first image of humanity is a nice one. But they slowly realize that not everyone is like that. Some will want something from you, some will help you only if you help them. Not everyone is like Orestis.These two kids slowly start have doubts. About the world, the people, even and their journey. After a point they don't really care if they'll meet their dad, they just want to get out of this place, to rest, to find life, to say goodbye to the lifeless place they used to live and find another one. They just want to be done with their journey.Also I have to say that this is the easiest Theo film to watch. There is a lot of dialogue, it ain't very long or slow and it also is fucking brilliant!

10254,"Bizarre, hallucinogenic, at times baffling, and richly steeped in Japanese folklore, legend, and spiritualism, Spirited Away is objectively the most commercially and critically successful of all of Hayao Miyazaki's hallowed filmography, and yet somehow left me cold and bewildered, unable to emotionally connect with its admittedly resplendent and beautifully animated display of unbridled phantasmagoria.It might be heretical to say that I don't think this is Miyazaki's or Ghibli's greatest feature. While it is certainly infused with gallons of genius and is rendered lovingly and painstakingly by the sure hand of the undisputed master of hand-drawn animated cinema, my two girls and I were enrapt by its entirely outlandish premise and narrative, but not emotionally moved in the same way we were by some of the master's less fantastical work like Whisper of the Heart or even From Up on Poppy Hill. For me it was more like a funhouse spectacle than an emotionally immersive experience, and that distinction could have been due to my mood at the time of watching, or perhaps due to the ""stage of life"" in which I currently find myself, in that the story of Chihiro's ""initiation"" through separation from the safety of parents and a familiar world is experienced so as to ultimately discover and assert her true identity and purpose in life, perhaps just didn't resonate with me right now. I don't know. Bottom line, while I didn't adore the film, I don't regret watching this, and I'm thrilled to see that a hand-drawn film like this won the Oscar (shockingly the only one to do so) and earned a huge box office cume, but I just had trouble connecting to the material. I certainly recommend it to others, especially those with families, although my younger daughter was slightly disturbed during a few scenes. Despite my somewhat lukewarm feelings, Spirited Away is unquestionably heads and shoulders above just about any CG animated features originating from the Western world, with their penchant for loud noises, potty humor, and unrelenting (cartoon) violence. That said, this is no doubt a must-see for Miyazaki enthusiasts and depending on your taste for wildly fantastical fare, you might very well just think this is the best thing since sliced bread, like the vast majority of peeps on this site.

30375,"Red Beard marked the end of an era for Akira Kurosawa.  It was the most successful film in Japan in 1965.  But it had been a very long and difficult shoot.  It was the last film he made with the wonderful Toshira Mifune – rumour had it that he had grown tired of Kurosawa’s exacting methods.  And it was the last – for a while - of the long period of critical and commercial success he had experienced since Rashomon won the Golden Lion at Venice in 1951.  After Red Beard, Kurosawa entered some fallow years, leading to his suicide attempt in 1971, before resurrecting his career with Dersu Uzula and Kagemusha.  In truth Red Beard is a mixed bag.  Dr. Yasumoto’s ambition (Yuzo Kayama) is to look after the rich.  Medicine is to be a source of wealth and prestige.  But he is tricked into an apprenticeship under Kyoijo Niide (Toshiro Mifune) at a hospital for the poor.  A path to wisdom is therefore set before him.  And it through this traditional master-pupil relationship that Kurosawa explores many of his familiar themes of compassion, servitude to the common good and the need for personal sacrifice – and the inner conflict this creates.But Kurosawa’s ambitions are also larger.  He chooses not to focus just on the internal struggles of Yasumoto, but instead he widens and sprawls to a panorama.  This is to be a story about the whole hospital, a social microcosm of course; not just the spiritual struggle of a young man and a wise old head; and so  he includes the personal stories of the patients the two doctors encounter. Amongst other strands, there is the story of Otoyo (Terumi Niki), a young girl saved from a brothel; or Chobo, a boy who steals food from the hospital. So the film feels novelistic, Dickensian to be precise.  It has clear artistic ambition. It is intended to be worthy. The film suggests strongly that poverty is the primary cause of illness.   It feels like an attempt at a masterpiece.  It pushes all the right buttons, at least on paper.  There is even a recreation of an earthquake for one very brief flashback.  No expense clearly spared.But the difficulty I have is that these digressions add little to the story - except length.  They are interesting and often dramatic in their own right: Red Beard is never dull.  And for a film running at three hours that is an achievement.  But it also does not really add up to very much.  I wanted to spend more time with Red Beard himself, but the film keeps taking me away from him.  The film’s best scene is a wonderfully choreographed action sequence in which Red Beard beats up a group of men who attempt to hinder his rescue of Otoyo.  It is a bizarre and surreal scene.  It feels as it should belong in a different film.  But it also fantastically staged, exciting and amusing.  And we get to spend time with the wise doctor as he demonstrates his willingness to fight for a cause – even if it requires moral compromise and violence.The film of course looks wonderful. So many lovely composed shots.  Kurosawa’s choice of angles, camera positions and sensitivity to the combination of light and dark photography is the equal to anyone in film history.  In one sequence, Yasumoto encounters a psychopathic and deeply troubled young woman, presumably suffering from nymphomania (and yes, Shock Corridor did spring to mind).  Yasumoto is arrogant and feels he can cure the patient.  Kurosawa cuts simply to a simple two shot – the classic positioning of the good guy against the bad guy.  It conveys all the tension in the scene in one deeply elegant edit.  It is the work of a master.  And in Red Beard, there are lots of examples of outstanding composition.But the issue for me is that for all its ambition and grandstanding, Red Beard amounts to little more than a well told, gorgeously shot hospital melodrama. I wished it had been a simpler tale, perhaps a bit more like Ikuru - a similar and more moving story of the necessity to find the good in the world. But with so many undoubted masterpieces of cinema to choose from in Kurosawa’s filmography, it is difficult to recommend spending time with this lesser work.Watched as part of the 2015-16 Letterboxd Season Challenge.",5,red-beard

63300,"Week 09 - Auteur - Fritz LangI can’t help but feel the 25 minutes of footage restored in the “complete” Metropolis was lost on purpose.This is a film I had been wanting to watch for a looooong time, but still felt worried about. On a surface level, it seemed to fit what I like about movies, showing a fully realized world that we cannot experience ourselves. The problem is, it’s a silent film, and for the most part I only really click with ones that focus on comedy, since it allows for much more visual storytelling. Now, having finally watched this... my fears were somewhat validated.PrologueThe film’s first act is a solid, if not great introduction to the film. Its strong visual style is displayed right off the bat, combining hand painted sets with visual tricks to pull off a convincingly futuristic city with a long history untold but understood. Plot wise, it makes some good decisions, and some poor ones, but the pacing is standard old movie style. What ends up bothering me a lot is that it is very apparent that this movie would be better with sound. There are plenty of lines without titles cards, annoying me especially due to the inability to read lips since it’s in a different languages, along with a lot of story that ends up being told through the cards it DOES have. Despite being strong visually, the main plot is not told through this kind of storytelling, a rather large weakness.The neatest aspect is the film’s retelling of the Tower of Babel as not a mixture of languages, but as a tale of miscommunication. The bending of the tale to fit the themes of this movie really works, and I was thoroughly impressed with this.InterludeThe shortest part of this movie, this section is near masterpiece. Almost all of the film’s visual and editing strengths are displayed here, and you can clearly see the ways this film influenced others later on. The breakneck pacing makes sure you’re able to keep engaged, and then comes my favorite aspect.The last few minutes of this portion aren’t sci-fi, but instead biblically apocalyptic imagery. The film had hinted at some of this in its first act, but here we start to have haunting imagery as the world’s end starts to be implied. It’s trippy and impactful, and I wished this had remained.Furiosa Annnnnd here’s where the movie begins to disappoint. This final act is nearly a full hour long, and there is no longer any setup to be had. It’s nonstop action, tension, and setpieces... and it’s boring.It’s all shot well, don’t get me wrong. In fact, there’s no way they skimped on the budget here at all. It’s just too much. Maybe at the time this was engaging spectacle, but now you just want it to get to its point. There are multiple scenes that were “lost” here that I kept imaging didn’t exist, and honestly I came up half the time with a “yeah that wasn’t necessary” response. Cutting this down by half would have helped with pacing.By the time it gets to the end, it’s worn you down in a negative way, and you may even find it wasted it’s good will. For the most part, though, I still enjoyed aspects of the film enough to like it and appreciate it, there’s just no part of me that feels like as a whole it remains a masterpiece as anything other than a remnant of the past.",5,metropolis

Somebody but a cigarette end in the water bucket.It’s a perfect transition from one film to the next and an effortlessly brilliant critique of the martial and tyrannical attitudes of wartime Japan.It’s also brilliant how Kaji’s experience echoes that of the people under his rule in the first film’s PoW camp. Thankfully, this is done in respectful and unredictive ways that highlight his outsider status and the state of his nation. A clever mirroring is his wife’s visit, which brings to mind the sending in of the women in Part I. Here we see what a nation is doing to its own people, how they are - in an important way - prisoners of war.This film also branches off in interesting ways, revisiting the themes of the first in different ways. It’s a lot of attempts at humanism and goodness in cruel systems. Once again, we see a protagonist beaten down because of this - the only option was to have not partaken. There is no changing from the inside. It also pretty uniformly shows the upper echelons and those with power as deeply negative - which aids its anti-imperialist politics.This all crescendos in a shocking war scene that is unexpectedly grand in scope - and is one of cinema’s best depictions.The character work isn’t as strong as Part 1, and the overall film not as profound. It feels like a middle step, which it is, but it feels like this to a fault at times. It also loses sight of the wider politics at points: the imperial army and what they are fighting for. It does loop around to this at the end somewhat in one of many great exchanges (the dialogue is excellent throughout). However, after Part 1, I expected something that could better handle a single story while symbolising wider conflicts and politics. All this being said, this is still definitely excellent.",7,the-human-condition-ii-road-to-eternity
62204,"Boredom is the ultimate weapon against cinema, and art writ large. I'd rather watch a 'bad' film than a boring one any day of the week. Sometimes, however, boredom can have strengths, and perhaps pay off in some edifying climax. Not this film, though.Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (an obnoxious mouthful of a title that's both appropriate for such an interminable cinematic exercise, but totally unjustifiable given its parochial subject) is boring. Not an original hot take, but it's the absolute truth. There's probably a fascinating 90 minute feature buried in here that would still be slow and meditative, but far more fruitful come conclusion. Instead we get the most unpalatable three and a half hours of film ever critically lauded.Far more entertaining yet excruciatingly pathetic is witnessing every critic and LBD user trip over themselves pretending this is a 5 star film (lying out of both sides of their mouth), or as recently designated by the British Film Institute: 'the greatest film of all time!' How insulting to film history, film culture, and frankly art itself. The New Yorker even had the audacity, and with all sincerity, to praise this film due to its 'revelatory tedium'. What? I haven't read one critic who's articulated why this is a good film beyond trite politically correct feminist reasoning. Reading all these male critics pretending they understand how this film taps into the female psyche trapped under the patriarchy is laughable in the most unsettling way. It only highlights the utterly reactionary impetus behind both the production and response pirouetting around Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du....Nothing in this incessant film justifies its sinister ending, which is at once misandrist and feminist in the most bourgeois possible way. Even in the 1970s, art-house cinematic feminism appears to only know how to substantiate itself by murderous violence. Is that what feminism is? What in Jeanne Dielman's life excuses such a sadistic snap? There's no answer.I'd make the argument that this isn't a 'feminist' film anyway. There's a deep contempt for the housewife, the mother, and prostitution throughout this film. Jeanne Dielman's life only appears tedious and uneventful because Chantal Akerman chose to make her life that way. Multiple times throughout Jeanne could do things to make her life more exciting, but she doesn't. Not the 'patriarchy' telling her she can't, she chooses not to. She doesn't need to sell her body, she chooses to. If the worst thing in her life is another woman sitting in her favorite cafe spot, then her life isn't too bad. She has a great apartment in Belgium, how is she so oppressed? Her son doesn't talk to her much, but they seem to enjoy a mostly quiet, peaceful life. Maybe he could say 'thank you', I guess?At the end of the day, 'progressivism' (whatever that means in our era) has merely embarrassed itself and humiliated one of the great art forms by appointing this as its ultimate north star. Some nice shot composition though.",1,jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles
32756,"Just shoot me in the fucking head next time. Please, tell me this is all just some inside joke where people just pretend to like this.Edit: Sleeping off to see if my opinion on the whole thing to change. I'm sorry, but I was struggling to find anything redeeming about this. From my experience, there were a few films which I simply didn't get on my first viewing. The Tree of Life being my first Malick film, Eraserhead being my first Lynch film, The Killing of a Sacred Deer being my first Lanthimos film and Under the Skin being my first Glazer film are prime examples of me simply not fully comprehending the director's intention. The thing is, in all of those cases, I subconsciously knew I was missing something and I had this incentive to revisit them to fully grasp its themes. With Mirror, however, I have absolutely zero desire to watch any of it again. Every time the narrator was reading someone else's poems I kept thinking ""How different is this from me reading those poems alone? How is the use of film as a visual medium going to enrich my experience of someone narrating someone else's poems?"" My problems with how Tarkovsky decided to approach the storytelling does not end here. What exactly is the purpose of the kid reading Russia's religious departure from that of Europe if he's stuttering every other word and I already know the history behind it? Why is it just him reading this stuff instead of showing it to us? At the themes of ""nature vs man"" ""war is pretty bad lol"" and ""man wants to be a child again"", I could only respond with ""OK, and?"" and ""Who cares?"" The film is so lost in its disjointed and confusing narrative that I simply have no desire to delve deeper into it. I found these existential questions to be tackled much better in other works that had more appealing visuals, actual emotional impacts and characters behaving like real people. And while I wanted to give this a 1/5 initially because I liked those camera pans that sometimes changed the scene, this time I am rating it based more on how it made me feel. In this case, it made me feel completely and utterly nothing.",0,mirror

87178,"“What she bottles up on a sunny day, flows as from a broken dam on rainy days”I’ve had this film on my watchlist for a long while now and I’m not even sure how I found out about it but I’m glad that I did. I know this sounds pretentious but this is the kind of film that feels more like experiencing art than it does watching a movie. The way this whole movie is filmed is so original and I’ll always prefer that over a director that plays it safe every time.  The director of this, Hideaki Anno actually seems to dabble more in animation seeing as he made Neon Genesis Evangelion but I’d say he does just as good with live action judging by this.While I loved this movie I must admit that it was quite jarring when I first started watching. It’s almost impossible to predict the kind of vibe this film has off the poster. I thought it was going to be sad and depressing but the girl gives the movie so much more energy than you would originally think. The girls personality really is part of why I loved this so much. Obviously she can be a bit much at times but she almost comes across as a dramatized version of mental illness and yet I was still able to relate to her in many ways. Her using her cat to distract from her problems was the most relatable.Ritual has some strange moments as well as some feel good ones but overall it’s a pretty serious film that explores both mental illness and relationships involving mental illness. When I say mental illness here I’m really being broad as well, this film covers generational trauma, abandonment issues, codependency, and even escapism just to name a few. A big part of the story for me was how the director wanted to get out of his fantasy filled mind while the girl was trying to get lost in her fantasies because I’ve been in both positions before.The biggest message that I took from this film is that sometimes all a person needs is someone else that will fully appreciate and love them just for who they are. Watching “Her” (which is the girls name apparently) struggle with her mental illness can be difficult at times but it’s so wholesome watching her become happy in any way once she’s with the director. Ayako Fujitani gives such a brilliant performance, it’s quite possibly one of my favourites of all time. Sadly it’s paired with one of the worst ever because Shunji Iwai seemed like he’d rather be doing anything else with his time than filming this. To be fair I found out that he’s a director and not an actor but still. Luckily despite the one poor acting performance, everything else is enough to make this film great. The cinematography  really is beautiful and some of the set designs are stunning as well especially the girl’s room with the red and white theme. The only problem I had cinematography wise was when it would switch to the free hand camera footage, then it just looked like a YouTube video. Maybe that was the point but it still looked bad. I love the shots of the smoke stacks though and like I said, overall the cinematography is strong. I don’t think everyone will connect with this one but I think those that do really will.",8,ritual-2000

A genuine very strong and very human story here of a group of incarcerated individuals who come together to become artists in a truly unique way by crafting theatre in which each of them bring a piece of themselves to the process, for better and worse.Singing those Stagy Spoilers Below 🎭The biggest accomplishment of Sing Sing are some truly powerhouse performances. This goes doubly for our lead Colman Domingo’s protagonist Divine G. He brings a ton of nuance and beauty to this protagonist, and it’s a performance that proves to be Oscar worthy for sure! And now here’s where our spoilers get salty!!! It isn’t revealed until the end but almost all of these other actors are the actual theatre actors who were imprisoned in Sing Sing and went through the RTA program. With this knowledge some of the monologues that are given will likely hit even harder in rewatch. Seriously some near tear enducing stuff here! The acting is fantastic from some of these guys! Our story is lovely too and really highlights through a terrific screenplay how art can bring people together, highlighting their humanity and how drama can contribute to the healing process in life. I thought it was terrific how some of the dialogue spoken spoke to their humanity in the production but also how theatre was important to their growth and relationships as they come together to write and craft a crazy fun play called Breakin’ the Mummy’s Code.Beyond that, I’m not sure what accolades I would lay at the feet of Sing Sing, despite its human story and actors really carrying this! Greg Kweder’s direction is good here but not outstanding. The cinematography elements sometimes worked for me and sometimes not so much. At times the shots are never steady with the actors in some of their rehearsal scenes, which I found irritating. But there is great use of lighting in some cell block and stage moments which accentuates  the more tender human moments. Overall though, Sing Sing does make effective use of the confined prison setting, contrasting this stark environment with the vibrant rehearsals and humanity of our leads.All in all, Sing Sing is a very strong drama, and whatever issues I have are slim to none. This is a gorgeous story about the transformative nature of art with some really phenomenal acting on display!

87259,"I have to give Hideaki Anno credit for one thing at least. Ritual is ahead of its time in that it's a deconstruction of the manic pixie dream girl trope before the trope was even named and years before it became a trend to look critically at those stories. Though maybe deconstruction isn't the right word. Rather, Ritual shows the darker side of such a relationship, that mental illness is painful and exhausting, not a fun adventure. Unfortunately, Anno's portrayal also makes for a dull film. The unnamed ingenue in the film is quirky as can be, but not really fun or funny or interesting. While we're told that he wants to put her in a film, there's no plausible explanation as to why the director character becomes so obsessed after their initial meeting. A better film would make the ingenue alluring in some way and then pull back the curtain, but she's annoying and uninteresting from the beginning, with surface level weirdness but no depth. As the film progresses, we learn more of her backstory, but that backstory conflicts with itself. We're told so many lies that it's impossible to know what to believe. Stylistically, Anno makes some good choices. There are a few shots that stand out and the production design is interesting, though not quite on my wavelength. The zoo scene is well done, providing the feeling of rapturous infatuation that Ritual desperately needs. But it doesn't come until over an hour into the film. Too little, too late. Ritual's third act has a bit more narrative thrust and deepens the characters somewhat, but the ending wraps everything up too neatly, which undercuts anything true the film might have said about mental illness. It honestly makes me think that maybe I'm misreading things and the whole film was supposed to be fun and light and just missed the mark.",4,ritual-2000

I love crime films/TV shows, but this is the best legal film I've ever watched in my life. 12 people, 12 different people, different characters, it's like a duel to find out the truth about if a young man is guilty or not. Some people lose their temper trying to be objective with their own opinion, even if that's not the case for everyone. This is a gem in its interpretation and, above all, ahead of its time on racial issues. When a black man in the 50s is accused of murder, he's already dead in the court of public opinion. But then there's Henry Fonda, thirsting for the truth and convincing almost everyone to check the facts and nothing but the facts, with a new perspective and an open mind, arguing in heated and interesting debates in perfectly framed shots. The tension is heightened by the sound of the rain banging on the window during most of all the film. The whole film is memorable, but the scene in which the old racist spews all this hatred towards an entire people, and everyone turns their backs on him or looks down so as not to listen to his shit, gave me the shivers when I cried because the intensity was so insane.

50671,"A good, atmospheric thriller that is a bit too long (quite a bit, actually) but nonetheless manages to reel you in again and again after you've had a few distracting moments.Paul Dano must get the first accolades. He was fantastic. Maria Bello was terribly underused. I'm not sure why they even bothered having the wives there at all. There were more scenes of vehicles than there were of the wives. Perhaps they were not used much because the writer didn't know how to write for them. At one point Maria Bello says to her husband: ""you were supposed to protect us"". Goodness gracious, seriously? Only a male can write that, and only a male who has very weird ideas of what women think and say. Hugh Jackman was good if a bit over the top every once in a while, but I guess in his situation any of us might be. Gyllenhaal was very quiet and subdued. We never really get to know him. He's just the guy doing his job, which, when you think about it, might be a good thing. I mean why should we know more about him; he's a cop doing his thing and the story isn't about his life or his personal story. So kudos to the writers for not going down that tired road of thinking characters all have to have families and personal lives.The film is perhaps too structured in the way that all of the elements fall together a bit too nicely, but perhaps that is required in a thriller: if you show a gun in the first scene, you had better use that gun at some point sort of thing.I was totally gripped, 100%, until a certain gentleman broke into a home. I knew the story was shifting a little at this point, but I was so engrossed in what was going on before I didn't want anything new. I would have loved it if the story could have stayed where it was at that point and found its way to a conclusion with just the characters we already knew.*** SPOILERS until the end ***The things I found a little too neat: the whistle, the man in the priest's house and how he ends up being connected with all of this, the guy at the vigil and his connection. It all felt too neat, too much for one story, which is probably why it was 2-1/2 hours. Had it been 2 or less, some of these connections probably would have fallen by the wayside which would have made me quite happy.I wasn't a fan of the torture segment of the film, and I'm not convinced it had to be there. I'm thinking of all the flack Zero Dark Thirty got and I'm surprised this one isn't getting the same treatment. Torture to get information, and in this case it works, but to avoid making that statement they ensure that the information is also had through a different source without torture. I don't know, was that Villeneuve's plan? Even if torture works you can get the information some other way so why bother with it? Is that his statement?The one thing I cannot complain about is the tension. Under normal circumstances I find too many connections make a film look trite. In this case it bothered me and took me out of the film a little but Villeneuve was able to grab my attention within minutes of having lost it. The film had a claustrophobic look to it, all weather and close shots in small quarters. Heck even most driving scenes were tense, going too fast or driving in the pouring rain or in slippery snow. The film was definitely chock full of tense moments, with an additional eeriness that crept through and never let up.It could have been truly great had it been shorter.",6,prisoners

28770,"Very pretty, very stupid, very exhausting. There are so many discrete movies here it's difficult to know where to start. I like the space travel and the Wexler-lite texture of the farm scenes. And I like the cornball Americana of the prologue -- though why does the 22nd (?) century look like 2014 crossed with the Dust Bowl era? But this increasingly delves into some seriously goofy shit, pretzeling itself into ungainly metaphysical shapes. Or worse, trailing off into noodle-scratching scientizations of love as the secret ingredient to modelling ""the fifth dimension in three-dimensional space"" -- paraphrasing, since I couldn't hear half of what anyone was saying in the IMAX mix -- and hazy theories about gravity as the invisible ink of cosmic daddy-daughter love letters, and on and on. Don't know what that means? Neither does Nolan: the whole last act plays in 2x speed, like the bit in Inception where Cotillard runs us through how she got ""certified sane"" by five psychiatrists. At least that finale has the decency to be bonkers: the middle stretch indulges Nolan's worst instincts as a storyteller, starting and stopping for tedious embedding/extraction missions on mystery planets, as unimaginatively realized as the dream levels in Inception, right down to the OCD exposition about how many years an hour entails on a given world. This is supposed to raise the emotional stakes -- ""I've got kids, professor!"" -- but in practice it's like watching people calculate a freelancer's rate based on dollars per word in realtime. Let us not speak of the payoff to the father-daughter plot line, which involves a man tweeting out his vast knowledge of the universe to his academic offspring in morse code on an intergalactic loom. ""They didn't believe me,"" she says, ""they thought it was all me,"" the first time in human history a PhD has insisted upon deferring credit for a discovery. Nolan has always had a Woman Problem -- just count  the dead wives -- but this is a bit much even for him.",4,interstellar

How Fellini is able to direct these gigantic sets with so many actors and elements is to be admired.The narrative and themes of the film are incredibly interesting, as Rome is presented as a city of immense contrast full of lust, fame, riches and eccentricities, and at the same time deception, poverty, deceit and death and all from the perspective of a single man played masterfully by Marcello Mastroianni.",9,la-dolce-vita
79755,"Lately my thought-world has been so strongly with the shitty things of life that I feel like I'm soon at the point where I'll explode because of paranoia. But like Haneke says, the terrible and dark things of life are still part of it and they are constantly present, no matter how we want to forget them, so it does good to face them. Amour despite being painfully accurate, also manages to become beautiful; simply because it doesn't embellish the portrait. I spent my civil service from 2015 to 2016 with mostly lonely elderly people who had problems with memory, suffered from schizophrenia, had physical atrophies and so on. If I was asked to do that again, I probably couldn't do it but sometimes you just have to face your fears and prejudices. There are always going to be beautiful moments even if to get to those, we must take the bad and the difficult, the heavy stuff. The beauty of life in itself never becomes Haneke's main point though; it never feels that his aim is poetry because he approaches the subject with certain objectivity that forces him to become neutral even when he is talking about his inner thoughts and fears. In a way, it feels almost like a meditative oriented film making - to feel the world, one must reach certain peace of mind. Also, not to mention Riva and Trintignant is a crime since these might be their best performances and since both have had such a rich careers (to the point it feels almost impossible to achieve so much), it really says something. Riva did have a hard time getting through the shoot as the subject was painfully close but she still does it like a true artist; without that input to her art, we could question her as an artist but since she goes with her passion to the end, there is no questioning that she is a great artist.",8,amour

2998,"Parasite from 1982. Filmed in 3D. A Charlie Band co-production with Irwin Yablans back in the last year before he started Empire Pictures to distribute his own films. Charlie had this idea to film it in 3D because it was the thing at the time. Before filming started, a Paramount exec called him and asked him if he could make a 3D picture for them to run right after Jaws 3D. The theatres had to be re-configured for 3D and Paramount wanted to get their moneys worth by running another 3D picture right after Jaws 3D. Charlie said that he had something and Paramount said they could pay him no more than a million for it but it had to be ready quick. Bingo. That's in Charlie’s wheelhouse. The budget was reported 800 grand (I don't believe that for a second) and Charlie has it sold for profit before shooting had started. Plus he got huge distribution. All because of shooting the flick in 3D. It made over 5 million in the box office so everyone came out a winner, except the audience. Charlie Band directed (only his 2nd ever, technically his 3rd but he doesn't count the actual first one) and co-starring Demi Moore in the feature debut. Also starring Robert Glaudini (?) and a small role for Tom Villard, who I always found somewhat annoying. The best acting is done by Al Fann as Collins. He's a natural. The plot is simple and yet still not fully explored. It's plodding and the writing is mostly dull and the characters thin. Demi’s character serves no purpose other than to be punched and kicked. The Dr. Dean character is portrayed very wooden by Glaudini. The best character is Ricus (Luca Bercovici) but his backstory is only teased and not fleshed out properly. Ten minutes of pointless shit should have been cut out elsewhere and given to the Ricus character. More time on his character transitioning to an antihero would have redeemed this story a lot. As it is, it's Charlie Band material. Cheap effects. The 3D uses the same bag of silly tricks you see elsewhere at the time but nowhere near as fun as in Friday the 13th Part 3. This film moves too slow to get to an obvious destination with nothing interesting along the way. Forget about that reported 800 grand budget. That's some creative accounting for resale value. Even with the 3D expenses, I would be shocked if this cost over 500 grand. 4/10. It's not offensively bad but could have easily been better.",3,parasite

23810,"At long last, I finally managed to sit through a Federico Fellini film without falling asleep well before the halfway mark. And it only makes me wonder if I should've started my stint with the influential Italian filmmaker's works with this one instead of 8½ which I still have no desire to return to, having tried it several times before yet falling prey to its sleep-inducing power every single time.As for Nights of Cabiria (Le notti di Cabiria), the film is a surprisingly accessible, thoroughly human & consistently tragic story of a woman who longs for love & happiness yet only finds pain & heartbreak on every turn. For a narrative like this, it is necessary to have a character who viewers can get behind, one who can compel them to invest in their journey but Cabiria didn't intrigue me enough.Instead, from her first scene, she comes across as naive & arrogant. And as the plot moves forward, her heartaches turn out to be less coz of bad luck & more due to her own stupidity. Nevertheless, beneath her bitter skin, there also lies a purity that Giulietta Masina is able to capture & express beautifully when she isn't going hyper or hammy. And she also hits perfection in the last minute that also drives home the film's point.Overall, Nights of Cabiria is a bleak yet hopeful story about the indomitable will of the human spirit and renders it through the titular character's unfortunate journey through life. The film's final moment leaves a lasting impression of its own and in retrospect also redeems much of what unfolded before but there is a lot of meandering to get there. It does better when connecting the dots later than in the moment. And in the moment, it was a slog.",4,nights-of-cabiria

86649,"This one made into the rotation as something that I've seen repeatedly on a bunch of peoples' favorites in their profiles and a film that I've seen pop up repeatedly in the feed with glowing reviews. After watching it, I feel like Letterboxd needs a disclaimer of some sort on it. I hadn't heard much about Xavier Dolan prior to watching this, but upon reviewing all the write-ups in a vain attempt to understand the larger reaction to Mommy, I plan on filing him into the Pavlovian Indie Huckster cabinet alongside Alex Ross Perry. This was written and directed by a kid in his early 20s, and it shows every wanting year in its creator's short time on this planet. The common myth about baby rattlesnakes having no control over how much venom they pump into a bite victim comes to mind. Everything about this, from the runtime to the gimmicky 1:1 aspect ratio to the overwrought score to the clumsy-as-hell opening title cards to the completely unsuitable treatment of its main character to the phony portrayal of the adult world screams unchecked self-indulgence. Dolan obviously trades quite a bit on his rep, and if the rest of his filmography is like this it's an entirely undeserved one. The bells and whistles are noisome and feel like they're meant to distract, and I'm not going to expend effort picking it all apart. It's all tiresome and indicative of a director who's trying constantly to dazzle me with bullshit. My reaction then is to consider the core narrative, and what do we get when we reduce this to its base components? Mostly, the antics of a psychopathic little shithead and his entirely unearned sympathetic portrayal. The moving parts of this story begin and end with Steve (Antoine-Olivier Pilon), who relentlessly makes the case from beginning to end that he belongs in an institution somewhere. Let's forget for a moment the random outbursts of violence and the fact that the film begins with the aftermath of him disfiguring some other kid, and go straight for the fact that this is a depiction of a sexual predator. Dolan tries to get a rise out of his audience by shooting scene after scene of Steve's inappropriately sexual attachment to his mother Die (Anne Dorval), but it's his relationship with the neighbor Kyla (Suzanne Clément) that proves more jarring. For some inexplicable reason which I guess is related to some lack of attention in her own home, Kyla decides to tutor Steve in his home schooling, and from drop he refers to her sexually and makes continued advances, which progress into touching her breasts and threateningly blocking a door after an altercation, which thankfully didn't go on to the rape scene that I was certain was coming and kept threatening to occur at any moment. I don't have any issue with repulsive characters. God knows I've enjoyed watching enough of them. I do have an issue with a director who's so tone-deaf that he expects to feel sympathy for a sociopathic little antichrist because he cries a couple of times while violins blare in the background. Get the fuck out of here with that entry-level manipulative horse shit. Your supposed connection to Steve and therefore to his mother and second mother figure hinges on taking bait that would shame a starving pit bull in its obviousness, and Dolan is so sure that you're going to swallow it that he feels free to keep leaning on the car horn narrative and depict scene after scene after scene of this loathsome kid who belongs in a prison somewhere. And it's galling to me that he's 100% correct about that given the reaction this film got among critics and theatergoers. There's some stuff in the film that attempts to put a few flimsy throw pillows on the core relationships by opining on the nature of familial ties. Loving someone can't save them. No shit, kid. By presuming that there is only one response to that axiom, which is to just sit around and be destroyed, the potential exploration of something that could have been interesting is short-circuited entirely. Dolan judges the shit out of Die for making the decision that she does in the end, thereby rendering out all of the complexity this could have had. Having a destructive family member is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and yet everyone seems to have been hit with that curse. Imagine living your life by the principles in the world of Mommy. ""Sure honey, I guess you do hit me because you love me."" Sheeeeiiiit. That's really what makes this go down badly. Moralizing about the contents of a film has never been and will never be something I countenance. But trying to pass off your ill-informed, warped vision of the world as something that's a valid alternative to the real one, to the point of weaving your own sympathies ham-handedly into the narrative is untruth. It's the inflicting of ill-considered worldview onto people who don't know any better than to swallow anything with colorful-slow motion shots and a certified uplifting score. More than anything, this activates the same feelings I have whenever I watch something by Lars von Trier. Hollywood's always had a hollow relationship with the moral trends of the now, but every time that guy makes something, people who ordinarily scream from the rooftops about the slightest of injustices eat up poisonous misogyny without a second thought. Actors who seemingly know better put their all into whatever performance The Master deems fit to give them, and the performances here remind me a great deal of that. Everyone working on this is clearly putting a great deal of effort into the craft, and it's probably the one redeeming feature of this. These roles, flawed as they are, are certainly conjured full force by the players. Would that they had a better patron. If you're going to try and sell me on the cruelty of the outside world and how it keeps people down, and makes them into things that no one wants, it would help if you started with someone that didn't make me want to fist-pump every time they got the taser.",2,mommy-2014

Instead we have the chronicle of two male friends with unresolved and one sided feelings and how their story intersects with the historical story of a changing China during the first half or so of the 20th century.

54861,"I can only imagine the intense pleasure liberals (and of course conservatives as well, but that goes without saying) got out of rubbing one out to Christa getting hit by that truck or the book dedication to HGW XX/7.Fuck this movie. This is just neoliberal idealistic and moralistic slop packaged as some meaningful statement about “totalitarianism.” It’s one thing to make a movie critiquing East Germany and the Stasi (because yeah, the GDR wasn’t a cloud cuckoo land, it had some issues). It’s another thing entirely to make an absolute caricature of socialism, socialist countries, and socialist people. Where to even begin? I could mention all the silly little lines about “these people are enemies of socialism” or “I sit with the lower ranks at lunch despite being an officer because socialism has to start somewhere” that the various socialist bureaucrats drop throughout the film. Holy on-the-nose, Batman! Like seriously, portraying socialists as cultists slavishly following some dogma is so cringe and ahistorical. Or I could talk about the choice to make every socialist state official in this a Mr. Burns-esque villain who taps their fingers together menacingly, twirls their mustache, and makes every choice based on personal vendetta and “intuition,” while the subversives are sympathetic, humanized victims who just want to love each other and make art. I mean, every single communist in this is made to be as unlikable as possible, it’s comical. Or I could talk about the presentation of Mikhail Gorbachev as some sort of savior figure who releases the masses from the evil clutches of communism (that shot of his photo right before the time-jump to the fall of the Berlin Wall is laughable), despite the fact that Russia and the rest of the Eastern bloc suffered horrible destitution after Gorby chose to dissolve the USSR. Yeah, everything was not all hunky dory when the Wall fell, believe it or not. Or I could cry laughing at the choice to set the film in 1984, in an obvious attempt to draw a fried comparison to Orwell’s Big Brother. Give me a break.Look, I’m not trying to say that the Stasi and the GDR are above criticism. Of course not, that would also be ahistorical. What I am trying to say is that pretending that communism is some kinda boogeyman and presenting that view in this caricature of a film is ludicrous. The West is shown as the savior in this film, almost like a paradise, where freedom and liberty reign. Because we all know that Western nations don’t surveil their citizens and use that information to punish dissidents, or if they ever did it’s all over now because Snowden blew the whistle. Oh wait, that’s complete bullshit, and we in the West are constantly surveilled, it’s just that only some of it is done by the state and the rest is done by private corporations in the form of date-farming. I mean Christ people, Oppenheimer just came out and it showed the ways the government has followed people, surveilled them, witch-hunted them, and attacked political opponents viciously based on this surveillance. Not to mention what happened to revolutionaries like Fred Hampton or Malcolm X or MLK. The list goes on. East Germany was no worse than the rest of your liberal democracies, and in some areas was actually better (LGBTQ rights, homelessness).And for you liberals who think I’m a raving communist wearing a tinfoil hat: did you know that Ben Shapiro cites this as his favorite non-English language film? Or that this movie tops several major online lists of “Best Conservative Films” (including IMDb)? Or that the director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, is a West German aristocrat who maybe doesn’t have the most unbiased view of East Germany or communism? If you agree with anything Shapiro believes, you don’t get to call yourself a leftist.And besides all that, this movie is just not very well-made. The screenplay is absolute shit. First of all, the main character, Wiesler, is not fleshed out at all. We know absolutely nothing about his backstory or his motivations. Instead, we are meant to believe that he goes from thinking it’s okay to torture prisoners by preventing them from sleeping to get information out of them to suddenly becoming a softie and wanting to help political dissidents because he gains a soul or whatever. Like huh? Paper thin screenplay. Are we meant to assume that it was exposure to the “true love” of Dreyman and Christa (which, if you watch the film, is laughable in and of itself) that changed his mind? If so, that’s stupid, but either way there’s no concrete indication as to why he changes his mind in the story itself, which is even stupider. And it’s not like the West has ever harassed and blacklisted artists, no indeed. Also, there’s the fact that the Stasi goes to great lengths to surveil Dreyman in this, with elaborate wiretaps and everything, but doesn’t record anything and relies entirely on people’s notes? So fried, the entire plot hinges on one’s ability to accept this unlikely fact. The cinematography is not anything to write home about, and there are some genuinely baffling editing decisions in this; some of the cuts look like crap. Extremely mid filmmaking. Plus, they use the classic “communist country lighting” and the most brutalist buildings they can find to show the lifelessness of communism or some shit. And then they slather over all of that the extreme melodrama derived mainly from the constant “evocative” music or corny, over-emotional dialogue. Unreal Oscar bait. Get me outta here. And the movie is way too long, could have been 20 minutes shorter.I wouldn’t even care as much about all this if the movie didn’t present the liberal capitalism of the West as a moral juxtaposition to what we see in the film (even though appeals grounded solely in morality don’t really move me as a historical materialist). If the film was just about some of the issues of the GDR, fine, but to pretend that  the West is any better infuriates me. Everything depicted in The Lives of Others has been done by every single capitalist country, in spades. The last thing we need is some movie decrying communism because of some made-up bad things done by a country that doesn’t even exist anymore; that story is told every day in our society. It’s pure propaganda. Not into it. There are people whose opinions I hold in high regard who rate this film highly, and I’d be lying if I said that my respect for some of them hasn’t dipped a bit.",1,the-lives-of-others
40870,"Afterthoughts: Watching Jean Cocteau’s Beauty and the Beast and David Lean’s Brief Encounter back-to-back was a real treat. Extremely different in many respects, but thematically apt to make for the perfect 1940s double bill.Both films evoke the spontaneity and potency of falling in love, and that none of us are safe from its miraculous, reckless and merciless nature, no matter how content we feel in our current relationships and situations. By the end of each film, both pairs of characters find the notion of being apart nigh on impossible.Brief Encounter is a strange film (especially for the time in which it was released) in that the spectator is faced with a moral dilemma with regards to their enjoyment of watching the romance unfold. Laura (Celia Johnson, an incredible performance) and Alec (Trevor Howard) are not regular adulterers and scallywags, and they love their spouses very much. But one chance encounter brings them together, and despite all their best efforts to remain faithful, the love potion they’ve tasted proves too strong a brew to resist its seductive allure. We as the audience share in the lovers’ guilt, shame, turmoil, joy and infatuation and feel naughty enjoying the gay time we spend with them in the cafés, stations, restaurants, cinemas and parks. The fact we are shown how lovely and kind Laura’s husband, Fred (Cyril Raymond), is before she begins her narration/internal confession, makes us feel so terrible that it happened and that we end up loving what we witness throughout the film.Noël Coward’s words are so beautifully-crafted, one couldn’t possibly help but fall under his spell and revel in his linguistic dexterity. There really isn’t anything quite as satisfying as hearing the Queen’s English so skilfully articulated by pen and tongue, and Brief Encounter didn’t half have me longing for the times when the majority of English folk spoke in such a fashion. The language and the clothing (when everybody dressed nice and smart, wearing suits and hats everyday) really is the major pull for me when watching old films, and I’m one of those people who will always feel they were born in the wrong time.This only marks the 3rd film I’ve seen directed by David Lean, and I’m definitely thirsty for more now. I think next I will move on chronologically to his two Dickens adaptations (released in 1946 and 1948 respectively), as I recently bought Great Expectations and listened to the audiobook of Oliver Twist.",8,brief-encounter
46663,"Chosen by Aventador117. The left side of my brain kind of loved this. The right side was exponentially less intrigued. Let me explain. I admire a lot of how this story is told. Wings of Desire isn’t an inherently cinematic tale, but it’s clear that the medium of film works perfectly for what it sets out to accomplish. The use of color is fascinating, creating a stark contrast between the spiritual and physical, whilst still weaving one singular story that creates a harmony between the two. Musical cues feel absolutely magical; in fact, some moments almost felt like something out of a video game as the little chimes often played out when something was revealed or thought of. The editing also adds to this fantastical world, feeling very dreamy. It’s not a sharp as one usually associates with good editing, but for a more mythical story, it works perfectly. All in all, the technicals are commendable. Unfortunately, I was much less impressed with what the story being told is. Now, I found the last act of the movie to be fantastic. The way it builds on why the story was going for made for a pretty entertaining and interesting time. However, everything before that was much less pleasant. I was not really enjoying the first hour of this. Although I wouldn’t say it was unwatchable by any means, my mind started to wander off multiple times, because what was currently occurring on screen was fairly boring. It just all felt repetitive and I couldn’t connect to what was happening. There was definitely a clear story being told, but they were also exploring other ideas from all sorts of angles and only some of them stuck with me. I think it got better as it went along, but it’s the type of film that if I suddenly lost the ability to watch it midway, I wouldn’t be all that sad about. And due to this, moments of catharsis or emotion weren’t nearly as strong as they could’ve been later on. When the movie ended, I didn’t really feel like I experienced all that much. It was just a fine time. It’s a good movie though. And as something to watch before the end of my spring break, I think it served its role well. It’s somewhat comforting, and I feel ok going on ahead with the rest of the year.",5,wings-of-desire

It's stabilised by a first-time naturalistic performance by fourteen-year-old David Bradley as the charismatic delinquent Billy Casper and puts forward themes concerning social class along with other issues which continue to persist and which are pertinent and prominent within the filmmaker's filmography in general.It commands a view and spirit of a brutal working-class existence and never breaks faith to its concept by unfolding into any mawkish sentimentality or endeavouring to offer up any solutions, but it does manage to unearth aspects of spirit and wit in even the direst of circumstances which keeps it from developing into being remorselessly heartbreaking.

Because it lets writers off the hook in actually constructing a through line with depth and they can just dive out of committing to exploring depth and switch to “another universe”. Just adding more to make the story move along is not good writing, it’s the sign of people who don’t really get character and just go into spectacle to cover that up. This movie feels like a series of (corny) gags mixed with cheap sentimental cliches as it’s emotional backbone. I also just question the cliches of the hard Asian Mom, the confused 1st Gen kid of color (who has to have the white partner) and the close minded old country patriarch. It’s just so tired and unoriginal. And throwing all these specials effects and costume/set changes doesn’t make it any less lame. Michelle Yeoh is quite good in it, and it’s always a joy to see her act but that can’t make up for a bad movie. It’s just spastic and lives on the “surprise” style of making movies. Its also way to damn long, this movie would have been better served at 90 minutes. We don’t need most of the techno babble BS and the extra drawn out emotional moments (never have I ever been annoyed by a bagel in my life). It’s Marvel and Michel Gondry’s annoying kid.

I did really like the film’s continued and thorough motifs of theatre-of-life, of everyone performing, everything being a stage, everything an interpretation or a mask, and I also really liked Jean-Louis Barrault’s tragic performance, even if the character is totally absurd.

51075,"Sci-Fi Film Challenge - The Road to my Top 10So before you get out your pitchforks, hear me out. I really wanted to like, 2001: A Space Odyssey, co-written and directed by Stanley Kubrick. I know it’s well-respected but I just couldn’t get into it. While this is a very low 3.0 for me, I’m able to say that I can at least appreciate the visuals.The pacing in this is super slow and meditative. The opening held my attention, wasn’t sure of the point (still am not) but I was intrigued. From there it was downhill. Andrei Tarkovsky called this film “cold and sterile” and I don’t think that’s way off base (also I like his ‘this is how to do experimental sci-fi’ way better). No one has any emotion in this film which not that Tarkovsy’s films are chock full of them but they definitely have more to offer in its characters. I also hated the three minute musical numbers with space as our boring subject or real time elongated moments set to heavy spacesuit breathing.The one thing I at least appreciated was the filming. I love how circles are Kubrick’s shape of choice to work with. Circular objects, circular setting, circular movement. It makes for an interesting visual motif. I also dug the walking scenes. The way the camera is set up symmetrically and tracks backwards, making it appear like a consistent incline traveling upside down is awesome.Interesting ending. I certainly recognize this is a classic even it’s not for me. I’ll read some reviews and hopefully my mutuals can explain why this is a masterpiece.Gerty > HAL iykyk July 2024 First-Time Watches Ranked",5,2001-a-space-odyssey

It's at the point where films cease to be enjoyable in their own right, but instead require a thorough existential examination in order to glean anything from the experience beyond a vague, icky feeling.Stalker is a film that seems to *demand* boredom from its audience.  In every slow, long, deliberate, and thoroughly uninteresting shot, the film seems to be waving a pendant before your eyes and whispering ""sleep, sleep, sleep.""

But I'm really not interested in having to take a class in order to appreciate a film.The settings are vaguely interesting, the transition from sepia to color striking, and the use of extremely long shots noteworthy.

Of course you can picture the most disgusting, most unbearable thing with the camera, but using such an abomination in such a cheap way is at least as hideously pathetic as that abomination.

This looming presence of death elevated each heartwarming moment tenfold, knowing that at some point, it will be taken from not only us, but more importantly, from the siblingsAs dark and grim as this story is, it beautifully showcases the exuberance of youth and how when presented with the harsh aspects of life, sometimes we need to turn our looks away from it for a little while longer. We see both the positive and negative aspects of this way of life howeverI noticed many moments that would normally be more broken down in other films be glossed over rather quickly.

Its about an Aspiring comedian named Rupert Pupkin who does whatever possible to reach global recognition.The story is actually pretty good, Given as to how insane the picture is it can make the story unpredictable where you never guess which direction it will take and does not shy away from being as crazy and wild as it can. It also does a good job at building suspense where the situation can get so intense that you will never want to leave your eye off the screen, which really shows how engaging the movie is thanks to the incredible writing and Martin's excellent directing.The characters are great, Starting with Rupert Pupkin he's the aspiring comedian who is craving for world recognition. While there are times where he is a genuine guy the more you think about it the more you start to realise that his desire for recognition is his major flaw and is the reason he isn't getting to the top as easy as he hoped. Jerry Langford is a character who has to suffer the most from Pupkin's antics though he is really good, Rita is Rupert's love interest and is the one between her and Pupkin that actually has a brain and Masha might be a person might be more insane than Rupert as while she also wants to get to Jerry she wants to in a more creepy way.''The King of Comedy'' is a great film and shows Scorsese's amazing filmmaking skills.

2261,"Included In Lists:Criterion Collection - #480Review In A Nutshell:I have finally reached at the end of Masaki Kobayashi’s acclaimed trilogy, The Human Condition, as it continues the tale of Kaji (Tatsuya Nakadai) whom we last saw at the front line of the Japanese military. Now he and his remaining companions attempt to escape the searching and cautious Russian army, in the hopes that he could return to the loving arms of his wife, of whom he is hopeful still at home patiently waiting for him. At this point of the series, we have felt the grand change that Kaji has endured from his experience. The sights and decisions that he has made has left a significant load on his shoulders, aware of the fact that he no longer represents the ideal figure that he saw himself to be at the series’ introductory film. We witness a downfall that parallels to the loss of his country in the war, tragedies and hardship seems to befall onto his lap as he trials his way back to his wife, a palpable sense of constant danger and endurance tests that showcases the inevitable fragility of the human spirit, even someone as strong-headed as Kaji. Certainly this film is an improvement over the predecessor and almost as impacting as the introductory film, but as a whole, I cannot help but deeply admire the efforts of not just Kobayashi, but also his leading man, Tatsuya Nakadai, who provided his role a remarkable sense of depth and compelling growth that achieves a level of authenticity in this figure’s evolution. The Human Condition may not have left the same mark on me as Harakiri did, but that is not to say that this is a film that is not worthy of its place in cinematic history.

76690,"The Green Mile is a near-perfect adaptation of a deeply flawed source text. The film is superbly acted, beautifully shot, and elegantly scored, and Frank Darabont clearly cares about the book he’s adapting. But Stephen King’s original novel doesn’t make for a very strong movie, especially following the brilliant Shawshank Redemption.I don’t think this movie can be improved. Every actor gives their all, especially Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Jeter, and Sam Rockwell. But the rest of the cast doesn’t have much to do — Tom Hanks remains relatively subdued for the entire movie and barely has a character arc, and the other guards are similarly one-note. The actors shouldn’t be blamed for their characters’ lack of complexity, though — the film’s moral framework is so basic that it essentially sorts its players into “good” and “bad” camps, without ever challenging our first impressions of them. Nobody in this movie really undergoes a meaningful change, and nobody seems like a real person. The lack of realism certainly isn’t an inherent flaw, but the seriousness of the subject matter (the prison system and the death penalty) deserves a certain level of complexity and reflection that The Green Mile’s simplistic moral framework doesn’t permit. Where Shawshank presented layered characters and a much-deserved indictment of the prison system, Green Mile provides thin caricatures and acceptance of the status quo. Darabont’s previous film showed the highs and lows of the human experience through the lens of incarceration, but this one basically just melodramatically theorizes that the world is sad. I guess there’s some dramatic irony and thematic consistency surrounding healing and death, but it somehow feels fleeting and heavy-handed at the same time. And though Duncan’s performance is the crown jewel of the movie, his character may be the most egregious example of the “magical Negro” trope that I’ve ever seen in any medium.Again, I think this is a well-constructed and beautifully acted movie, but its story and characters are so flawed that I can’t really recommend it unless you’re a big fan of Stephen King or Tom Hanks. It might be the biggest disappointment of SepTomber.",5,the-green-mile

63559,"An epic tale of timid shyness in the face of true love, and the regret that follows when that true love slips away. One decade after France temporarily dropped the cinematic criticism towards the bourgeois class and one decade before the French New Wave grew in size and worldwide importance, Marcel Carné and Jean Cocteau contributed a seminal film to the French filmmaking catalog. I’ve always heard this touted as one of the greatest French films to exist by prestigious lists and organizations. But I can’t seem to fully agree with the praise?I'm pretty conflicted on Children of Paradise. It has potential. The way the film looks is absolutely ravishing, the elaborate sets, the fantastic theater sets, and just how detailed every little historical detail featured its expansive love story. The emphasis on physical performances and theater highlight the birth of cinema, and the influences on the medium. And I grew to love the sprawling melodrama regarding the central romance. The film wears its heart on its sleeve and has a bleeding heart for long lost love. Unfortunately the introduction to oh so many characters means a fairly small amount of time to get to know any more than Baptiste, Frédérick, and Garance in depth. Everyone certainly feels like they are serving a role—i.e. Love Complication #1, Other Comic Relief, Jealousy Catalyst—and one of the things clearly missing is human motivation. This venture in poetic realism seems so caught up in the poetry that it pits it at odds with realism instead of fusing them or appreciating them alongside one another. Many decisions (and lacks thereof) are made in order to prolong the central lovers' pining agony and amp the drama way up which feels stretched out.Characters lead each other on and put them in false senses of security just to betray them, all in the name of poetry and ""love"" rather than reflecting on the inhumanity of these acts. For a three-hour film, these characters spend incredibly sparse amounts of time together before making final judgments on how to treat them for the rest of the film (which spans over six years, forgot to mention). None of the relationships change as much as they are just concealed or revealed. Now, the fact that this film was made under the Nazi occupation is simultaneously inspiring and crazy to believe. I have read a couple think pieces on this site detailing the hidden metaphors for the Second World War, and which character is a symbol for a specific part of the occupation. That subtext, however substantiated, flew right over my head. I was simply engaging with the surface matters of the film, and that’s all I picked up on a first watch. The scope, ambition and sense of yearning are all very impressive in Children of Paradise, but it’s the extended length, number of characters and archetype heavy script is what prevented me from loving it.",5,children-of-paradise

It’s extremely complex and unique from typical films, the director John Cassavetes creates films that resemble real life problems in people’s every day life, now of course many directors have done this before but he attempts at topics people like me aren’t particularly interested in, the film lose me at around 90 minutes in as it became dull and boring with extremely slow pacing and uninteresting characters, it’s a hit or miss.",4,opening-night

33112,"Criterion Collection Spine #385(Foreign language film)(The Average Joe’s Movie Club Cast Episode 18)A bleak depiction of the desperate efforts a band of covert French resistance fighters take, in their struggle against the Nazis who occupied their country during WW2.  ""Unhappy memories! Yet I welcome you… you are my long-lost youth… ""With a title like Army of Shadows, I was really looking forward to finally getting to this classic French title in the Criterion Collection. But unfortunately, the movie's slow minimalist style left me feeling disappointed. This is the second film I have seen from Director Jean-Pierre Melville, with the other one being 'Le Samouraï'. And while I thought that one was just ok, the lack of memorable moments in Army of Shadows during its nearly 2 and a half hour runtime made it a tedious watching experience.So after feeling this way I felt obligated to understand why this film is so highly praised. So from reading more about Army of Shadows and listening to the commentary, I often heard the following elements of Melville's style praised:- Channels exquisite minimalism- Uses cerebral long takes and silence- And my favorite or should I say anti-favorite 'he shows restraint'While I mostly prefer bold films that deliver an emotional gut-punch, I do appreciate occasional subtly as well. But my overall lack of connection with any of these resistance members made it a real challenge to become emotionally invested in their struggle.Spoilers:For the most part this movie just felt like it was comprised of these French gangster types walking down dark streets, and occasionally betraying each other when they would come together. And thinking back on it now, much of it has blurred in my memory. But there were a handful of moments that caught my attention, but unfortunately did not carry forward any momentum after they passed including:     - The Nazi marching band parading in front Arc de Triomphe, which I am sure was a big slap in the face moment for the French about this period of history- There was an exciting scene where the main character was able to get away by stabbing a Nazi in the neck- The sequence where he goes to London on a Submarine, and then goes to see 'Gone With The Wind'. Which now that I think about it was pretty symbolic I suppose, with that movie also reminiscing about a way of life for its main characters which is now only in the past- The machine gun tunnel scene. Wow, did that Nazi have some bad aim with such a big gun. And those rescuers were right on time to help him get out of there- There are some stakes with people getting tortured off-camera and killed, but I never felt like I had a strong sense about what lead up to these events taking place- All the talk of cyanide pills- And the melancholic piano themeI have also heard this film praised for the sense of bleak realism that it depicts, and maybe I just came in expecting it to be more exciting and cinematic. These are just my views, and if you think there is something I am missing here, please share what you enjoy about the film in the comments.

51626,"My boss suspects me. She stares at me all day. But the other girls keep staring too. - I have a feeling Alain Delon had that problem in real life as well. Impressive that this blue collar story of a down-on-their-luck migrant family from Southern Italy moving to northern part of Italy is made by a literal aristocrat, a Count. The director with possibly the coolest name: Count Luchino Visconti.Epic in its runtime but intimate in scope and the sweep of its story. At once an exploration of the social and moral strands of then contemporary Italy, and the diverging paths of a quartet of brothers as they try to find their way away from home, pulled apart via circumstance and differing personalities. As Italian neo-realism movies go, this is very good, with shades of familial melodrama and tragedy that befalls this family - there is one absolutely heart-wrenching scene that belies the otherwise social drama that this movie is going for, a bit of Dostoyevsky in there, it almost felt like.",7,rocco-and-his-brothers

I saw the avalanche of positive reviews and got pretty excited myself to finally catch this in theaters. Not to mention this film, as of writing, is currently sitting at #1 all-time in the official Letterboxd Narrative Feature Films list. All of this is to say, I appear to be in the minority in my disdain for Everything Everywhere All at Once and was counting down the minutes until its merciful conclusion.Perhaps it’s the style of comedy. When it comes to raunchy, random humor, I am in most cases not going to be the target demographic. Please, for the love of god, stop cutting to the people with hot dogs for fingers universe. It wasn’t funny the first time and I don’t need to see it for a tenth time either.Maybe it’s the shallow, one-note characters whose entire motivations are driven by single issues for the sake of plot mechanics and moving the story along.It could also be the Marvel-esque plot dumps that occur with regularity in order make sure the audience is on the same page with its characters who also can’t follow the convoluted and messy plot structure without everything being outright explained like it’s a Wikipedia page.Oh no, I got it. It’s got to be the empty truisms and bland universal moments of truth that sound less like a profound moment of clarity and more like a hastily written college freshman paper from someone who forgot their philosophy assignment was due at midnight.Again, I don't get the hype. I don't think I'll ever get it and that's unfortunate because I really wanted to like this but instead came out hating it.Sadly, Everything Everywhere All at Once is about nothing and ultimately goes nowhere… all at once.",2,everything-everywhere-all-at-once

In my opinion, Stalker is artsy-fartsy nonsense. For one thing it moves at a pace that will rival paint drying. It’s as if the film is just daring you to fall asleep (which I did 3 times before I ever made it through this thing.) And, let’s be clear, it’s not as if the images that it asks you to stare at for long periods of time are beautiful either. This world is ugly, grim, and half the time shown in black and sepia instead of color. What passes for story in this movie is just a trio of guys who journey to a place they never arrive at, and they stop to talk philosophy on occasion. I have no patience for this kind of rambling dialogue that fights to imply a deeper meaning than the movie has earned. The promise of interesting things that could potentially happen in the story, like life-threatening danger and magical wish granting, never come to fruition. Instead people just talk and occasionally walk. I’m willing to accept when a film makes me think, but first the movie has to engage me enough to make me want to spend time thinking about it. Stalker does the opposite, it tries to disengage you. As if being silent and still somehow makes the incoherent babbling that comes in the midst of that silence deeper and more meaningful. It took multiple attempts and several breaks in between, but I managed to watch every moment of Stalker, and now I’m simply left wondering why I bothered. I’ll never understand why films like this are praised as masterpieces.Loses to Erin BrockovichLoses to Meek’s CutoffLoses to Despicable Me 3Loses to CocktailWins against BlindnessLoses to Evil Dead IILoses to Mauvais SangLoses to A.I.: Artificial IntelligenceLoses to Green LanternWins against The ExorcistStalker ranked 1198 out of 1243",0,stalker

26591,"I did it. I watched Satantango.The film that has intimidated me since I first started Letterboxd. Without including any spec of pretentiousness in this review, this film is not a 4.4, it’s not even close. Satantango is a cinematic marathon that requires patience, determination, and a willingness to embrace the world of ambiguity. Watching the film from start to finish is truly a triumph in itself, and only those who are brave enough to indulge in Bela Tarr’s “cinematic epic” will come out alive. Don’t get me too wrong here, the first half displayed an intricate atmosphere of bleak tones that set itself up to be a great film. Bela Tarr’s use of silence is just as powerful as his use in static shots, however, the narrative rarely offers a compelling reason to care for any of its characters as they aimlessly shuffle through a desolate Hungarian village.

1960,"""My work is part of me. Without it, I'd be dead."" ~ Kingu GondoDirector Akira Kurosawa certainly switched gears when choosing to make this modern film noir crime story based on the 1959 novel ""King's Ransom: An 87th Precinct Mystery"" by American writer Ed McBain (aka Evan Hunter, aka Salvatore Albert Lombino). It is neatly sandwiched among the filmmaker's more familiar medieval Japan epics, ""Yôjinbô,"" ""Sanjuro"" and ""Red Beard,"" placing his favorite sword-wielding samurai actor Toshirô Mifune in the role of a shoe company executive caught in a kidnapping and extortion plot.What stands out in this film more than anything is how easily Kurosawa diverts our focus from the supposed main character, executive Kingu Gondo, to Chief Detective Tokura (Tatsuya Nakadai) and then to the perpetrator, medical intern Ginjirô Takeuchi (Tsutomu Yamazaki). The forensics and detective work are fascinating, even if a bit outdated. There's a moral message here, too, about the dangers of pursuing success at any cost as well as the contrast of living high on a hill in affluence versus living low in a hovel among derelicts.Part of my 5 Directors x 5 Unseen Films challenge.",6,high-and-low

26487,"Bells echo from a tower that doesn't exist. The bellowing and snorting of cattle reverberates from the inside of a factory. It starts with one of many dirty, consumerist livestock, as they begin to pour from the opened gates of the dilapidated, crumbling building like blood seeping from a wound. They mingle with the outside world in the way that same wound's blood might wisp about and spread after dripping into a glass of milk. Moaning, searching, the cattle skitter about slowly but surely, some attempting to graze, some mounting one another in excitement. Around them is a barren, sodden environment of muddy, wet road. There doesn't seem to be a blade of grass in sight. The piercing cold, grey skies have eliminated any and all greenery. The trees are bare, coated only in wet, freezing rain. The cattle continue to roam, further and further away, until finally they turn a corner and disappear. The circle closes. Satantango was shot in the anemic fields of Hortobágy directly after János Kádár, the longtime communist leader of the Hungarian Socialist Workers’ Party, had finally stepped down. Béla Tarr returned to his homeland to begin working on the film, which he had been planning for years prior. The quickly crumbling infrastructure of Eastern European communism sets the stage for an otherwise languid, slow-paced affair.This is a film, first and foremost, about time and its relation to humanity. Whether it's about how time slowly chips away at us, or how we slowly chip away at it, I'm not sure, but Tarr meticulously pieces together this constricting, plodding experience with the confidence and expertise only a cynically depraved Hungarian of his stature can. Scenes play out in full, tinged with harsh, bleak environs, creating a completely realized atmosphere of existential disquietude. The camera is always lingering, always present, roaming about the lives of the villagers at the heart of the narrative, coercing the audience into a similar struggle of existence. We are constantly both moving and staying stagnant, all at the behest of our coercive god-like auteur. We end up much like the characters, facing an indifferent, harsh reality, merely trying to scrape out a meaningful existence amidst an ever-shifting matrix of influence.Watching a movie at this length, a monolithic 432 minutes, both exhausts and exhilarates. It promotes a feeling of invincibility, as if you'll never need to watch another movie again, or that you can watch literally any movie ever now... which is extra ironic, given the lack of invincibility embedded within the subtext. Either way, Béla Tarr has made me stronger.",9,satantango

Its main character, who I can only assume is doing a lame Chaplin impression (and not even peak Chaplin), keeps going on and on and on talking about nonsense that you either have to filter out or really buy into in order to not be irritated. He's intended to be the funny super-likeable guy, but in a movie about one of humanity's most catastrophic events, it feels misplaced, even if its message has positive, optimistic intentions (does Guido not realise that in doing that idiotic German/Italian translation gag, he could have gotten everyone killed?). What exactly is this film trying to say? That ignorance is bliss? That we need to be happy? Not the most insightful, and it exploits the real-life tragedy of the Holocaust to say its trite messages. As Mel Brooks rightly points out, the most offensive idea in its head is that people can get over anything, even concentration camps, which is a ridiculous thought: try telling that to the million Jewish people dead from its implementation. This entire movie is like that shower scene in Schindler's List; feigning hope while denying historical fact. What should have been a tear-fest ended up an eye-roller.

The first half of the film completely captivated me and the story gripped me. However, I found that the three-hour running time was just too much. During the first half, I was full of enthusiasm and even thought of giving the film a very high rating, but then, unfortunately, it increasingly lost steam. Also, I found Alain Delon's character to be extremely unlikable, even though he was awesome.The film does try to evoke sympathy for Nadia, but it just doesn't manage it. Instead, the emphasis is on a misogynistic viewpoint, focusing on the concerns of the family and Rocco. The potentially interesting story about the social impact of migration is undone by the portrayal of heavy-handed and clichéd notions of infectious immorality. And this drags on for a full three hours! Despite great shots and good acting, Rocco and His Brothers ultimately failed to fully convince me. The idea that Rocco sacrifices his happiness and the woman he loves for a selfish, hateful and ungrateful brother is just illogical and stupid.Despite some positive aspects, the film was ultimately disappointing to me overall. The overlong running time and lack of sympathy for certain characters greatly affected my movie experience, and while I think the film might work better on rewatch, I probably won't be able to motivate myself for it in the near future.

50534,"A promising opening that moves quickly but patiently through the realization of children gone missing, allowing comprehension to dawn on parents without taking too long to get to the event, soon collapses as Villeneuve's arthouse-thriller aesthetic puts enough space in the shots that the distended, half-connected threads of the script have more room to fall apart. The film's greatest tension is in the total incompatibility of its forced stabs at social relevance (which at least aren't as clumsily on the nose as in INCENDIES) and the hyperbolic evil that arises out of such a natural and controlled setup. Snakes, symbols and Satanists (or at least anti-God types) descend upon this helpless narrative, plunging the material into such outlandish diversions it never recovers.Gyllenhaal, he of the puppy dog face, somehow continues to convince as a cop (he was also believable in END OF WATCH), and Hugh Jackman channels rage in a way he never has (Wolverine is an id-driven hate tank, but he's tempered by a thick streak of sarcasm). And then there's Roger Deakins' cinematography, which captures the crisp, misty air of the film's setting and imbibes it with the sense of the trail going cold. But this is all so much bullshit, like watching a cable series play out a full season from promising start to loony, forced additions designed to fill in a high concept, but in 150 minutes. It's that aspect that makes the high-gloss mediocrity more offensive to me; I hate to see cinema now chasing after TV, which is both a betrayal of what cinema can be and a misunderstanding of how television can operate on its own wavelength. There are far worse films this year, ones without an ounce of the redeeming qualities this movie has, but it especially shows off a worrying trend of TV now setting the cultural high-water mark.",3,prisoners

The contrast between a child's starved corpse casually draped over the pavement on one side of the wall and a lively market brimming with golden loaves and other luxury confectionery items on the other was an ugly portrait of our past.The narrative centred around Szpilman and his immediate family as they battled the perilous changes forced upon them. Adrien Brody and the supporting cast were sublime, together they spawned a dramatically moving Holocaust experience.Szpilman was your everyday gentleman but was also a very talented pianist. He proved to be an unique and uncommon type of protagonist that was a survivor and not a hero. All he could do was try and keep himself alive and wouldn't of done without some enormous luck, the kindness of some non-Jews and a music loving Nazi officer.There was a strange beauty to marrying up death and a piano. His staple piece that he played for the Nazi officer (Thomas Kretschmann) was uplifting and inspiring, it summarised the narrative beautifully. Warsaw eventually became a city of ruin and destruction, having the piano overlay the panoramic shots that captured it was very poetic.The opening ninety-minutes never rested, it continually had me on-edge, I got caught up in the characters emotions and anguish. Some frequent time-stamps propelled the story onward and also helped maintain a steady pace. However, the third-act didn't have enough stamina, once Szpilman left the 'ghetto' it started dragging its feet.How The Pianist made me feel was the films calling-card. It had me on the verge of tears on several occasions, mainly when the Nazi's were abusing their power and unleashing random acts of torment - (tipping the man in the wheelchair off the balcony, lining people up in the street and killing-at-will and the scene when Szpilman's family were being crammed onto the train) - I was shocked, terrified and in disbelief.Overall, the emotional weight that The Pianist carried was what made this a masterpiece. It truly pained me to see a group of people brutally put on the cusp of extinction, all because of different beliefs. Unfortunately a slow and lengthy ending cast the film's focus adrift but during those closing scenes when Szpilman looked up from his piano and conjured a warm grin, that moment touched me the most.",7,the-pianist

4806,"i feel so bad in saying that i didn’t gel with this one and because i have a tendency to ramble when i don’t gel with something, i’ll try to keep this short. ikiru sets up its premise right in the beginning. a man has stomach cancer and he doesn’t have long to live. feeling the monotony of his job as a bureaucrat, he searches for an answer to the question of how to live. i understand why two people would take the time out of their day to recommend me ikiru (and for that, i feel extra bad) because based on that summary alone, this movie seems like something i would love. a warm and emotional story ruminating on the meaning of life? where do i sign up? however, what i’ve realized is that i care much more about the motivations behind a person’s growth in their search for meaning. rarely do movies give satisfactory answers on the meaning of life, so i need to be able to understand why a character makes the decisions that they do. ikiru makes this thought process too straightforward.second, i didn’t like the tonal shifts. in both parts of ikiru an omniscient narrator controls how the story is told. because the point of an omniscient narrator is that they know what happens already, an unconventional story structure can be applied to spice up the narrative. however, i feel as if that comes at the expense of letting the man’s vulnerabilities breathe. clearly, the majority of people here don’t share this opinion. in-line with tonal shifts, i wasn’t a fan of the editing in the first part. all the quick cuts felt like i was watching an early talkie (if that sentence even makes sense). when the time comes to examine other people’s perception of the man in the second part and how wrong everyone is about him, i honestly found it hard to care; the emotional payoff didn’t feel deserved. maybe that makes me a bad person, i don’t know.hopefully, i’ll gel more with this one when i’m older. ikiru feels like a movie i should be saving anyway.this turned out longer than i expected.",4,ikiru

55867,"A charming and greasy little Vegas neonoir. The dialogue and structure come from William Goldman, so it all feels adult and important until it’s all over and you realize that it was just a bit of fun. Burt Reynolds never lets his pulse get too high in the lead role, leaning on deadpan swagger and sarcasm get him through every scene. The film moves at a measured pace because it’s about a bunch of sadsacks. The Christmas setting is there purely to add some extra melancholy and irony when the time is right. There are laughs, but it’s not a comedy. There are a couple absolutely ridiculous explosions of violence, but it’s not action movie. There are monologues about fate and masculinity, but it’s not a serious movie that’s about anything. The film coasts on vibes. Sleazy 80s dad movie vibes. Immaculate ones. There was a point early on when I worried my attention might drift. Then Burt slit a guy’s throat with a credit card and kicked another one in the nuts with one one fluid motion. My attention was rapt going forward.",5,heat
79745,"Amour is one of those films that you don't forget. It's real love portrayed in a way we don't usually see it, in a way we don't like to think about it. Love is supposed to be cute, heartwarming and emotional (in a good way). But love is also going through the rough and difficult parts where not everything is stars and rainbows, where you have to be there for the other person and take care of her even when that sends you in a path of suffering. And this film is incredibly real in a way that it doesn't portray love the way an audience would want to see it. We normally crave for that happy ending, for something to happen that will change the bad times to good times, but that doesn't always happen and Amour shows, in a heartbreaking way, that even though love can be very strong, life will eventually find its way around it. I have to give it to Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Louis Trintignant because their acting skills really sold this movie and their characters as not only characters but real people who fell in love, who after all those years still were in love and never gave up on that feeling, even when the time for the big decision came.I'm amazed by all of this.",9,amour

Money or flesh – skin gleaming with gold flakes.I don't want your gold, I want flesh– I want to touch human flesh. I want to kiss it, hold it. I want to fuck it. Haven't you ever loved someone?

There's structural issues stopping this from being great, but the main problem has to be the racism on display, at first in keeping with the monied white characters in their 1940s 'island paradise', but then also in the film's use of black bodies to represent transgressive occult sexuality – the voodoo scene is indefensible.",4,eureka

11416,"“You should have believed.”Despite this film possessing the narrative grace of an anvil dropped from a ten-story building, it is, at its core, a disbeliever of its own theme of faith. Faith in its audiences to understand more complex contexts than an overgeneralized and cliché depiction of war, faith in the story to slow down and provide characterization and symbolism in a subtle manner, and faith in the original text that it adapts from, the latter of which heavily criticized the figure of a messiah through mass consequences. It shows little belief that its audience can understand the nuances of a cinematic religious epic, so it takes the easy route of throwing famous faces and making tepid parallels to the Biblical tale most people in the world, in some aspect, have already familiarized themselves with, despite how it attempts to make weak parallels to the Muslim figure Imam Madhi and his arrival heralding Judgement Day. All kinds of theology are muddled in the hands of this disbeliever of a film. The measure of how much this film doesn’t believe is exemplified in Paul, who resembles more of a Christ depiction than Imam Madhi. This Christ figure's only challenge and fear is his inevitable fate as a Messiah, which he later arrogantly absorbs as absolute truth. The film appears to laud this Messianic path he takes with swelling music and sweeping visuals, which contradicts their intents double fold.If it attempts to criticize the concept of a Messiah, as the original Dune text did, most of its cinematic language seems to point towards the opposite: championing Paul as a righteously vengeful Messiah. If it attempts to show the glory of such a figure before his fall, it fails to depict the very things Christ was well known for—community and benevolence. The audience encounters communities through Paul’s eyes, but the film refuses to learn and empathize with the many characters and communities for more than a second. The Freman are simply a persecuted group that exist within a desert. Chani is named Desert Flower, but her name is simply used for narrative prophecy and not to build her own character. Paul and the film itself have no faith in knowing people other than their surface level details, which goes against every parable Jesus taught that screamed judge others as you wish to be judged and love thy neighbor. Paul is not a Christ that learns and spreads his words through kindness and adversity; he is an uncompelling Crusader that bulldozes through the desert with little conflict stopping him, invoking the name of Christ for the Holy Land, made all the more explicit with his mother’s call for the Holy Wars.The way this film attempts to capture the magic of Mad Max Fury Road is almost laughable. Fury Road does not claim itself as a complex religious allegory with compelling and nuanced characters, especially with how its marketing campaign framed it as, first and foremost, a simple action film. However, it effectively performs better as one than Dune with the underlying currents of community, resilience, and faith pumping and powering its veins like gasoline. Fury Road's protagonists are introduced simply, but possess intriguing motivations and are allowed to experience gradual character growth. Even its villains are shown to have a nuanced type of wickedness, as they have parallels to pale underground parasites of the desert, addicted to feeding off of other life forms, whether living or carrion. In contrast, Dune: Part Two takes out all the compelling notions of a religious parable with its simple fact that it does not believe in itself or its audience; thus, this film delivers a barrage of visuals, characters, and sounds at breakneck speed to force feed its narrative to its audience, fearful that they will realize its lack of faith.",1,dune-part-two

It's a frank display of the ups and downs of marriage, that doesn't resort to being melodramatic but rather heartbreakingly real in its leads' ability to translate the emptiness of shattered love. Its study of the way experience and age changes a person and their personality is great in how melancholic it is. Adding to this, I'm most impressed by how it flips the ""right person, wrong time"" plot on its head. Only at the end do we realise that they may just be the right people for each other now, though time has become their enemy; if only they got along when the time was right. As someone who has been a third-party to a crumbling marriage, the way Marianne & Johan enjoy one another's company with lukewarm affection later into the narrative felt nothing but depressing and cold.

5789,"Benign liberalism in the style of a middlebrow prestige film. It wears its ideology so blatantly that there is no subtext to the film. This isn't necessarily something I'm against, but there needs to be something visceral to the filmmaking to make the viewer feel the ideology. Here we get a main character who plainly states his ""theories"" about how to treat his fellow man. We take him as being right because there is nothing especially radical about his ideas, leaving it feeling completely impotent for any political ideas.Thus we are left we the only real point of interest being a mans struggle against the powers at be. However, this is handled with such a bland, cliched, masculine melodrama. We are exposed to suffering and sacrifice, but that suffering never strikes the viewer in any deeper way than ""its horrible that people have to struggle so much"".

49314,"Not sure how to explain why I didn't love this, so I'll start with what I did like: I LOVED the costumes and how Joy looks like a Bjork album cover towards the end of the movie. The editing was good. The visuals were a lot of fun, I loved all the confetti and glitter throw up. The lighting was great!! Visually the movie was great!! Also having to do something statistically improbable to jump universes was very silly and was a fun rule! I will admit my own fault that I probably went into this with higher expectations than I should have. I think I assumed the scale of the movie would be bigger and they would be jumping and running through different universes and different settings the entire time. And in the one fight scene they do that I loved it! I got so sick of that ugly office building so fast. I just wanted them to leave and be in any of the other universes and fighting anywhere else so fucking bad. This is probably my fault because I expected this to be like the Family Guy Multiverse episode, so maybe that's not a valid criticism. What I disliked the most about the movie was the dialogue and humor. I haven't seen any other Daniels movie but I don't think their sense of humor aligns with mine. I thought the Ratatouille bit was funny, but got annoyed at the other characters finding it as funny as they did. It just felt really Marvel to me. Also they do Family Guy style bits the whole time like random throwing up. The first hour and a half of the movie is just having things being explained and I feel like character relationships get thrown to the side for like half of the movie. I think the ""positive nihilism"" theme of the movie is just the most millennial, reddit philosophy ever. I don't know how to elaborate on that, it's just this feeling I get. I don't know.

The questions posed are not posed because the director intends to challenge Christianity, but to set up a false conflict that will eventually be resolved by God's miracle anyway. Imagine how interesting this film would have been if it simply stuck to questioning without answering. If it had been a thought-provoking film about the struggle for faith, both for the religious and the irreligious, rather than a propaganda film in favour of God, it would have been an extraordinarily intriguing film.

82377,"Original Title: KesYear of Release: 1969Genres: DramaDirector: Ken LoachWriters: Barry Hines, Ken Loach, Tony GarnettMain Cast: David Bradley, Freddie Fletcher, Lynne Perrie, Colin Welland, Brian Glover, Bob Bowes99/100 of A Decade Called 1960s: 2018-19 EditionKen Loach's Kes is very much one of the finest kitchen sink dramas of the 1960s. It is far from the ""boy befriends pet falcon"" premise that is usually used to describe this. This is a realist drama about a young British boy, bullied and hated both in school and at home, who really does not fit in the world. His training of the falcon Kes is not one that necessarily makes him grow as a person, but rather a way to escape from the cruel reality he lives in, escapism at its most tragic.As you can imagine, there is a lot of shouting, a lot of running, plenty of child abuse, and a whole lot of uncomfortably real scenes. The acting is pretty good, especially when most of the cast is untrained and delivers their lines in a seemingly effortless way. The young lead especially is quite great here, shame his film career never really took off after this.This is one of those films that is so close to reality that it's painful to watch. It's not an enjoyable experience, and I honestly wouldnt' even know if I would call it an educational one. It can be seen as misery porn, lacking sentimentality and catharsis that many often need in films.

13461,"During the tail end of the Hundred Years War the French were losing and morale was low. A young woman would rapidly come to prominence and turn the tide with decisive battles, most notably at Orleans. With visions from God she quickly became a symbol for the French people and a problem for the English. When she was captured by French noblemen allied with the English she was turned over and put on trial.""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" is a silent film that covers the final days of Jeanne d'Arc. For the most part the film plays out like a court room drama as the English sympathising church is holding a kangaroo court and doing everything they can to bring her down, ultimately burning her at the stake. I didn't love this film as much as others have on this site. It's a good film but I didn't find myself invested to the degree I'd originally hoped beforehand. As a biopic it does a fairly decent job covering Jeanne's final days, even though the film doesn't give you any context to her situation. Hopefully, everyone's brushed up on their history beforehand. I found myself admiring the film more so than engaging with it. There's  wonderful uses of close-ups that illicit a sense of sadness and intimacy with Jeanne. The film mostly has her framed in close up with her accusers holding off slightly, occasionally receiving close-ups when they volley abuse at her or are manipulating her to confess to crimes she has committed. On the subject of characters this film contains one of the best performances I've seen in a silent film. Maria Falconettigives a truly incredible performance in the titular role. The way she's able to emote with just her eyes is remarkable. Her face says a thousand words and she carries this film from the first frame until the last. Even if you're not interested in the subject matter it's worth it just to see her performance.I don't really have a bad word to say about this film. I liked it as I was watching it and I found the performance from Falconetti to be moving, I just, didn't love it. On a side note I watched this on the BFI player and the print they showed had numerous spelling errors which I found to be pretty egregious for a film that's been around for nearly a century.

The problem with this kind of movie is that usually the lauded performance is, of course, great, but the movie itself is bland or stupid. That is the case with such things as Capote or The King's Speech, but it is not the case here, as the movie surrounding Charlize is actually good. Not great mind you but it's good - Christina Ricci is great, so is Bruce Dern, I'm not really sure how I feel about the politics of the script but it seems that it does a good job of portraying Wuornos as a victim of society, while acknowledging that she was, absolutely, a monster, but she definitely shouldn't have been executed.

There are so many striking shots to be found here, indicative of a master filmmaker at the height of his career.

60133,"Save for about twenty minutes of the first act where the movie almost borders on being kind of interesting and something unique for this series, this movie proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that the rebuild movies are perhaps the most astonishingly worthless artistic endeavor in recent memory. The positively agonizing second act, which consists mostly of poorly staged action scenes and useless expository babbling, is far from unbearable (the bar really is that low for me here), but it’s the excruciating final third that sinks this lower than words can describe. Apocryphal religious vocabulary is tossed around with reckless abandon, garish, near-incomprehensible action scenes are stuck between obnoxious character interactions that do nothing but lazily signpost their thematic purposes as if Anno thinks his audience consists of media-illiterate toddlers. It disappears so far up it’s own ass that it becomes a half-remembered remnant of a real movie with real ideas, and somewhere amidst it all, I forgot what the purpose and themes of these movies are even supposed to be. I can’t tell you anything about the plot or characters in these films divorced from the show, and when I do connect it to the show, I cannot fathom a single reason why you should watch these having seen the series and End of Eva. It elaborates on nothing. It does not provoke a single new thought or idea not evoked by the anime proper. Watching it is a Sisyphean task, and the higher up the hill you get, the heavier the boulder gets, and in the final hour, I gave up and it crushed me. Clearly I’m not the audience for this since I think the other films are similarly useless, but this is the epitome of their pointlessness in my eyes. I don’t even *love* Eva the way most people do and this got under my skin. I don’t know if I would be willing to call it worse than 3, but I definitely hate this a lot more. From the dialogue, the annoyingly ‘on the nose’ vomiting of characters who spout trite details and ideas that are never reinforced by legitimate action or agency, to the excruciatingly painful final moments. This is simply the worst thing I’ve seen this year, and it made me question if I even liked the original series and film to begin with. An infuriating, messy, convoluted, deeply stupid film that feels like homework more than it does art. An exercise in robbing a rich, dense story with humanity at its very core of all subtext and turning it all into little more than blunt, graceless text. The less I say about the ungodly runtime, the better. A profound test of patience that at one point, convinces you that it might be something worth exploring- and then it just swiftly abandons this idea in order to become a dull wall of cacophonous noise. By the time it was over, I felt as though I’d entered some sort of purgatorial prison designed to poke and prod at my brain. I hate labeling things as ‘pretentious’- because it’s a phenomenally useless criticism most of the time. So, if I can veer away from that word, I’ll simply just call this ‘overbearing’ instead. Its final moments stand as a monument to why this was going to be disastrous from the outset, and I legitimately wish I hadn’t watched it. This goes beyond just not enjoying something, I legitimately found this to be artistically regressive in ways that distance me from the parts of Eva that I had connected to in the past- and I guess that’s poetic. Eva was always- in part- a scornful screed against its audience. An insightful, depth-imbued look at the exact type of person who cares far too much about anime, so I guess if the goal here was to replicate the feeling of the show’s original ending, this is a success after all, because I’ve never had less faith in anything I used to have fondness for than I do with the Rebuild movies, a graveyard where art, intention, and coherency go to die in the name of usurping a collaborative work in your own selfish name and then ultimately making it all about some misguided attempt at wish fulfillment without actually changing, being rewarded for being stagnant. The literal antithesis of the original show. For the record, I do think the cultural consensus on Eva is too specifically geared towards its self-reflexive, occasionally audience-hostile tendencies. It ignores so many other merits of the show, and boils it down to something that, at least in my eyes, risks bordering on turning Eva into something it never actually was. The whole Shinji = Otaku/Anime Fan dichotomy is one that feels supremely overstated, subtext that’s meant to inform the greater work, not replace it. In hindsight, it feels as though this aspect of the show has been brought to the forefront of the conversation on both Anno and Evangelion- and I sincerely think the lingering omnipresence of this insight has significantly damaged its reputation, as well as what it actively attempts to pursue as a piece of art. It’s a feedback loop where this one key element of the original work has been so pronounced in the years since it aired that it becomes wholly myopic. In some ways, I understand the dilemma Anno faced when trying to remake these, to take the parts of Evangelion that he contributed the most to or felt the most affected by, as it was made in the midst of a depressive spiral on his end, and effectively recontextualize and elaborate on his vision. As such, this approach is preferred to the alternative where he attempts to usurp the contributions of the dozens of other people who helped bring Eva to life, but it leaves me with a fundamental question: even if he took the smartest route with these final two movies, was this even worth pursuing in the first place? Sadly, I think this film answers that question with an emphatic, resounding ‘no’- what it all amounts to is a message that’s crammed into the back half of this four-film-long series that actively rejects those who felt affected by the original. I hate to say this, but to put it simply, Anno’s privilege that he found in a post-Eva world has alienated him to the point where his art is manifesting the regressive tendencies that the original work railed against in the first place. Eva’s diehard fans usually see themselves in the core trio of this show. Topics like depression, imposter syndrome, anxiety, parental abuse, queerness, they’re all covered to some extent in Eva, which is why its formative for so many. Part of the genius is that it doesn’t coddle them. For as ‘seen’ as these people have felt through this work, it also tells them that nothing is going to change if they do not. So what is the important message of self growth in this new creation? Well, to be blunt, it’s ’why are you all so depressed? Just get better like I did!’- which yes, I’ll admit is an oversimplification, but I remain adamant that the spirit of this sentiment is still there. The most baffling, perplexing thing about this is Mari and Shinji, which also paradoxically feel as though they’re the only real changes made that are supposed to mean anything. Instead it’s some half baked romance arc meant to be a stand in for how Anno turned his life around. Hideki, my dude, it’s simply not that easy. There’s a line between giving your audience some serious tough love, and just becoming wholly apathetic to them in a display of empathy-deficient ‘advice’ devoid of both practicality and genuine humanity. It’s a rejection of the thesis of Eva, and the only reason I can fathom justifying its existence is that Anno got so up his own ass with the whole ‘deconstructionist’ angle that the only meaningful place left to go for him would be to create something so misanthropic that it subverts itself… and I’m sorry but that’s just not enough. His stubborn refusal to let Eva die, parading around its corpse for more than a decade in the guise of uncovering some sort of further, hidden truth that allowed him to create something he could see as ‘uncompromised’- and I get the inclination… but there is a point where you need to let the past just be the past. You have to draw the line somewhere with art, and simply let it speak for itself. This entire new set of films however showcase- to me- an immense lack of confidence in your artistry to the point where you end up endlessly grafitti-ing onto something that should’ve stayed as it is. As much as I would love to view this in vacuum, away from its context, the movies simply do not let you. If there’s a reason that Anno chose to vandalize Eva instead of doing something new or different with the same themes and ideas that congeal together in a semi-cohesive way, I genuinely cannot think of one. The way you avoid all of this baggage and fluff? Simple: You Should Not Remake Evangelion. I am, quite legitimately, heartbroken that this ended up being what it was. I didn’t have expectations or anything, but I certainly didn’t expect to have a ruinous void in my heart that feels as though the power of art has been somewhat lessened vis a vie one of the more successful attempts to transcend the medium. [A brief addendum to any fans of Eva or fans of this film who made be reading this: my quarrel isn’t with you. I’m happy when anybody connects deeply to a piece of art, especially when it’s something cathartic or deeply emotional. I do that with a lot of stuff. Probably a lot more than I should, which is what led me to stuff like EoE in the first place. This review and my frustrations with both Anno’s goals and this movie are not directed at you in any way. Go on loving what you love, if anything, a lot of my resentment comes from the fact that I simply don’t understand the connections others have with the rebuilds. It’s important to consider that stuff like this, stuff that swings for the fences, can be something that gets a home run with many people- but is just as likely to be a complete misfire for others. My endless frustration is with the movie, not the people who enjoy it, so don’t mistake this for me being vitriolic towards you. Your interpretation and connection is a beautiful thing and you should treasure it, but I can’t sit here and lie and say that this worked for me when it didn’t.

72387,"I believe The Prestige perfectly encapsulates in one film the things that I usually don't like of Christopher Nolan and that, to an extent, have become part of his formula (for better or for worst). We have an unnecessary intricate plot with a bunch of twists and a fragmented narrative that disguise what is a rather simple plot in an effort to distract the audience. The characters are terribly underdeveloped and plain, if you take away their obsession you're left with a pair of empty vessels. The first forty minutes are boring, even if there are hints of the outcome this segment could have been edited into twenty minutes and not much would be lost. Finally, the director's need to overanalyze and overexplain things frankly gets on my nerves at times because this isn't particularly difficult to follow. If you have seen a couple of Nolan films by now, you will have no problem to unpuzzle this very quickly; especially because the director makes a ridiculous effort to ""hide"" one particular character and it's very clear from his first appearance that he plays an important role deciphering the whole mystery.In the end, just like the films itself, this is Nolan's biggest magic trick; it looks complex and is visually impressive, but the key to solve it is very simple, it's literally in front of your eyes the whole time. Don't let it fool you, this isn't smart or sophisticated, it's overrated and a bit of a mess.",3,the-prestige

64767,"Billy Wilder was one of our most cynical directors, and this is perhaps his most cynical film (though he did direct ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" so it may be a three-way tie). Few directors have ever been so great when they were at the top of their game, as Wilder was through the 40s and into the early 60s. ""Ace in the Hole"" is dead center at this golden age, coming a mere year after his phenomenal ""Sunset Boulevard"", and it does for the news media what that film did for Hollywood: basically show it as a breeding ground for the worst tendencies of human nature. In fact, I think ""Ace in the Hole"" shows the news media to be far worse than ""Sunset"" portrays Hollywood. The main character there is a man who is not quite yet beyond redemption. William Holden's screenwriter is still likable, basically a good man put in a bad situation. Kirk Douglas's Chuck Tatum is willing to jeopardize a man's life to further his own career, and he does so without batting an eyelash. He's a pretty bad man who takes a slightly bad situation and makes it far worse to suit his own ends. He's calculating, selfish and manipulative, and Kirk Douglas makes him darkly captivating every step of the way. It took real balls for Douglas to portray someone this unsavory, especially since he was one the biggest stars in Hollywood at that time. But that's what makes him such a great actor. he could play an idealistic hero and a genuine rat equally well. The location cinematography is also quite good, capturing the feel of the place in a way that enhances and informs the story. But it's Douglas's show and Wilder gives Douglas enough room to craft a performance for the ages. It's brilliant stuff, and all the better for being one of the darkest, most cynical films about a corrupt, manipulative news media ever put to film. ""Network"", ""Nightcrawler"" and so many other films owe it a debt, and those two are the only ones that come close to matching its sharp edge and dark tone. It's ballsy and utterly uncompromising, a film that avoids cheap melodrama or easy redemption. It's a poison pill, a dagger to the heart of an industry. And it is a true marvel, a great example of why Billy Wilder still matters, and why he always will.",9,ace-in-the-hole
47163,"Despite being one of the finest examples of genre-filmmaking that's neatly crafted, intelligently scripted & brilliantly acted, Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is a film that I admire more than I love. I've no hesitation in calling it the ultimate black comedy or the perfect satire but I also won't deny that my experience with it was rather ordinary, regardless of the few laughs in between.Set during the Cold War era, the story of Dr. Stangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb concerns a paranoid Air Force General who green lights a nuclear attack on Soviet Union without the knowledge of his superiors, thus causing mass panic in the Pentagon War Room where the President, his advisers, key officers & others desperately try to recall the bombers before they reach their destination.Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film is another masterwork of precision craftsmanship from the legendary director and I've nothing but admiration for its incredibly detailed n well-lit sets, the ironic elements in the script & its depiction of the complete absurdity of war. Camera-work is marvellously carried out especially during the base attack scene, Editing nicely balances its various subplots & its background score is a definite plus.Coming to the performances, the film features an impressive cast in Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden & Slim Pickens. Sellers here plays not one, not two but three different characters & is excellent in each one of his roles. Scott only gets better as the film progresses, Hayden is quite grounded despite his unhinged character while Pickens doesn't leave much to complain about & plays his role straight.On an overall scale, Dr. Strangelove might very well be the best political satire of all time for it criticizes the nuclear conflict between US & USSR in the most biting manner possible, but the farther we're moving from the Cold War era, the weaker its impact seems to be getting. It's full of crazy characters, is filled with memorable quotes & crafted with panache but despite its strong legacy, I don't feel much love for it. Maybe one day I will, but today is not that day.",6,dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb

Demi Moore is her usual charming self and it's evident she had the screen presence to be a star but sadly her character is wasted much like everything else in the film.

38768,"""Just takes a few month to get to be a hundred... if you're in the right place at the right time.""Oh man...certainly qualifies for a film that should have ended 5min sooner: what a shamefully selected ending. I was surprised to find that William Friedkin's Sorcerer is in fact a remake of this 1953 French film - which in return is an adaptation from a 1950 novel. I'd be willing to bet Sorcerer is well regarded in the selective category of superior remakes, because despite finding a lot of merit in Henri-Georges Clouzot's direction - and more so in Armand Thirard's lighting and cinematography, - The Wages of Fear's tension has not aged well for my viewing: at the time of release, no doubt. The marketed suspense and Hitchcockian ""bomb under the table"" thrills never ignited for me, as the only real concern I had the entire time was when were these supposed ""professional"" drivers going to stop smoking inside their explosive coffins. At 153min, I won't lie in saying I wasn't concerned hitting play. It didn't help that the build-up to the actual ""thrills"" takes an entire hour, that of which consists of establishing the setting, the plight of these wayward souls, and why they are so desperately willing to risk their lives to leave. While most of the cast does their job well - well, just the four selected, - I didn't find their chemistry that enticing. I know it's before his film debut, but Eli Wallach would have really spiced this film up. Unfortunately, I just didn't feel that that first hour was as engaging as it should have been, not only failing to produce a single character to root for or mirror as the audience nexus, but also crafting a very weak animosity between them and skimming through what makes them the proper choices to be selected as drivers. Hell, even Fast 4 showcased why Braga selected the drivers he did. I think keeping the narrative on a tighter locked-room thriller route, starting with their selection process would have made for more suspenseful claustrophobic character tension. Locke with two vehicles, two people in each, all hating each other but needing to work together or risk death. Again, these are things that I just couldn't buy into, which I fully acknowledge myself more than likely being in the minority here. It's just hard to scroll through a quick cursory glance of various 4.5 and above ratings, and not feel that slightest inkling excited for a banger going in. Even more so with the fact that it won the Palm d'Or, Golden Bear, and best film at the BAFTAs.One element that really bugged me is the unnecessarily undisclosed location. I appreciate the superficial socio-political critique of American imperialism in Latin America, with their banana republics and ""good"" neighbourly under the table cynical intentions. Which I'm led to believe is the primary intention of setting it in ""South America"" as described, just for that jab. Because the plot could occur anywhere, just as it could be a labour union plot in some dangerous Alaskan route or something. But I'm on this tangent because - albeit an objective personal tick - I kept wanting to figure out where they we're and why it was being deliberately concealed. The middle of nowhere village is called Las Piedras (which could be Uruguay or Puerto Rico if they're trying to set in a real location), Véra Clouzot is without a doubt Brasilian (given her accent and blended pronunciation of Spanish words), we have a German presence, an American company hiring cheap expendable help with no labour laws or regulations, and the area seems to be predominantly desert plains. So for a bit I satiated my constant questioning for the film being in Northern Uruguay, bordering Brasil and Argentina. The thing is, a sign is quickly shown in a scene stating tickets to Caracas, Venezuela being cheaper than tickets to Rio, Brasil or Buenos Aires, Argentina. So while it really doesn't matter too much, the location just doesn't make sense, and it kept knocking at the back of my head. Once again, a personal irritation, nothing that reflects against my rating or critical opinion of the film. Despite having thought Sorcerer was a supernatural thriller, I am actually more excited to check it out now. Frankly, I have higher hopes and trust in Friedkin, just as I now have for Ben Wheatley's future adaptation. I can already picture Michael Smiley complaining about his age and not wanting to drive the bomb on wheels.-FILM CLUB ETC.",6,the-wages-of-fear

Besides the obvious influence of their real-life father/daughter dynamic, it's clear that their banter and humor is informed by an authentic experience, no matter how different it is from any depiction of the Great Depression. That balance of sharp wit and underlying sadness makes for one hell of an emotional movie, especially when considering Peter Bogdanovich's craft behind the camera. Having László Kovács as the DP certainly doesn't hurt either. Not quite a total coin-flip of The Last Picture Show and its ruthless pessimism, this is nonetheless an adorable film that somehow never flinches from tangents of more overtly melancholic flourishes. The key performance for embodying this energy is Madeline Kahn, who continues to be one of the greatest scene stealers in cinema history.",8,paper-moon
67810,"Sorcerer is to Wages of Fear as the Phantom Menace is to Star Wars. Not in terms of absolute quality, of course. Sorcerer is a fine enough film. But it seems to function sort of as a prequel/remake of Wages of Fear. Friedkin focuses on elaborating on elements of the original film that worked perfectly as suggestion. Sure, these desperate drivers are on the run, but FROM WHAT? Sure, they need to deliver a bunch of nitroglycerin, but HOW DID THEY GET IT OUT OF THE SHED? Answering these questions doesn't really add anything to the perfectly constructed  suspense engine built by Clouzot. The final fifteen minutes or so have a hallucinatory power that stands out, and the ending is definitely superior to the original, even if it does make the interminable prologue necessary.",4,sorcerer
63691,"Garance: ""They're going to duel.""Baptiste: ""Because of us?""Garance: ""Because of me.""Why, though, Garance? Why? What precisely do you bring to the table that has thrown everything into such disarray? What gifts or treasures do you possess to make men hot in the head and boisterous in the nether parts? Whatever it is, it eludes me; and thus my enjoyment of Children of Paradise is extremely muted.I don't want to pretend the film is totally without merit, however. It's beautifully designed and well shot, for one thing. I adored the lavish set pieces, particularly the opening sequence along the Boulevard of Crime. For another, the story of its production – shot over two years while the Nazis occupied France, then released after the war ended – is itself worthy of being made into a movie. Members of the French Resistance and Nazi collaborators often worked side by side to make the film, with the former being unknown to the latter and some of the latter facing criminal charges following the restoration of the French government.The trouble for me is that, as fascinating as all the backstory behind Children of Paradise is, what actually transpires on screen is far less interesting. There are highly amusing passages, such as the long sequence that opens the second half of the movie, in which Frédérick hilariously lampoons some self-serious writers by butchering their play and turning it into a crowd-pleasing farce. There are some wonderful witticisms in the script as well, particularly in the verbal repartee between Frédérick and Lacenaire.In fact, as I'm writing this, I'm realizing that there are a lot of great scenes in the film... as long as Garance is either offscreen or not being discussed. Her character is so devoid of personality that she deadens every frame she appears in, even when she employs that bemused smile that seems all but chiseled on her face. She also isn't particularly good looking, so I can't point to that as a reason for why these men would be so drawn to her, either. And since so much of the plot here centers around Garance as some sort of innately magnetic femme fatale, not seeing the alleged appeal of Garance means not getting what is supposedly great about this movie.Stray thoughts:• Frédérick did very well hamming it up as a comic performer, but that Othello performance at the end was just bad.• Poor Nathalie.• Children of Paradise is frequently compared to Gone With the Wind, and there are clear parallels in the scale and grandiosity of the two films. Scarlett O'Hara is an incredible contrast to Garance, however, having so much energy and wit about her. If Garance was more like her, it'd be easier to understand why these men were so desperate to win her love.• The film I watched before this was Moonstruck, in which Olympia Dukakis asks a recurring question to some of the male characters. ""Why do men chase women?"" The answer Moonstruck offers is because they're afraid of death. Based on Children of Paradise, the answer should be the opposite: if you're afraid of death, don't chase Garance.• Actually, just don't chase Garance, regardless of circumstance.• Reader, if you didn't read ""circumstance"" in the previous bullet to rhyme with Garance, you really missed a golden... chance.//Added to list: The Classics That Weren't",4,children-of-paradise

11281,"A short time ago, Denis Villeneuve made a comment criticizing mainstream cinema's over-reliance on dialogue over audiovisual form for storytelling. While I think he overstated it (""I don't remember movies because of a good line."" c'mon), I respect the sentiment — I admire the arts of literature and theater and believe cinema can benefit by taking from them and I love and have defended films criticized for being too much like plays, but it has undoubtedly been an overreliance within the cinematic mainstream for a century. There's too much disinterest in using cinematic form beyond the innate value of directly recording something — sculpting light, editing and composing to convey dynamics, and general aesthetic tone; our medium's equivalent to a novel's prose and addition to a play's blocking — to create pace and mood. These are things used for non-narrative cinema and to enrich conventional, even literary-based, cinema. It doesn't strictly require dialogue.It turns out Villeneuve wasn't actually opposed to long, dry sequences of overbearing exposition because Dune: Part Two has plenty of that, but rather unable here to create dramatic pathos, interiority, and meaningful dynamics by any means, rushing through the beats of this grand epic with sound and fury for the sake of the immediate experience. Valid goals, yes, just not particularly effective when so much runtime is dedicated to explanations of things reasonably learned from subtler, more visual, and briefer methods and the form is so bland — not inept, not ugly, but boring. He's a formalist trapped in formality, a prestige journeyman with little directorial presence who works very well with very talented collaborators, unfortunately few of whom bring their peak ability into Part Two. The Villeneuve/Freiser aesthetic worked wonderfully for the brutalist interiors more prevalent in the first part, creating a mournful, dread-laden haze as the intrigue unfurled. Out in the desert it's certainly capable of striking moments, but the net experience is washed-out and shallow; digital wide shots bathed in concrete powder, unable to form either light and shadow into more than functional objects. Hans Zimmer's score, too, has lost texture, leaning further into ""falling asleep on the keyboard"" bombast without the internal ominous tones that make many of the tracks created for this world memorable.This, above all, is where Part Two falters: creating a meaningful feel for its mythological and tactical threads. But these threads, the literary, political, and dramatic aspects of the work fray as well. Every relationship and arc feels flattened compared to its predecessor; Lady Jessica's (Rebecca Ferguson) quiet glances, insecurities, and decisions navigating the political chessboard while trying to protect her family are replaced by overt scheming, dictated to the audience via conversation with a psychic fetus, with little time to develop the transition. Paul (Timothée Chalamet) is granted more room to breathe, but not enough. His relationship with Chani (Zendaya) is rushed and generic, weakening the tragedy that hinges upon it, but she's at least granted agency, and there is some time dedicated to introducing and quickly advancing their feelings for each other, something I can not say for the rest of the Fremen. Others more qualified than me have written about the specific issues portraying the Middle Eastern and North African predominantly Muslim cultures the filmmakers are drawing from (I'll leave links to whatever such articles I read if I remember to), but I am able to say general disinterest in this culture is felt. They exist in the text as a military unit and religious environment; no civilian life is observed beyond broad-stroke military comradery and the religious traits directly relevant to the plot. All aesthetic, no internality. A world that doesn't feel lived in yet is not formally interesting enough to justify said suspension of disbelief, creating an amalgam of cultures through a Western lens, alienating it, and then hinging themes upon understanding it. Brilliant. With so little for all these talented actors to do and so little formal finesse, it becomes a series of conversations and large explosions, intellectually conveying grand stakes and emotionally conveying next to nothing.Feel free to insert the words ""for me"" or ""I feel"" anywhere in this. That should be automatically understood, but this is the internet, so no.---I don’t want to fixate on connecting the subject matter of Dune to what I’m about to discuss (connections should be obvious, but it feels crass to overdo this on a review of a highly-fictional work) but I know this will get a lot of attention (relative to my other posts at least) so I feel obligated to leave links to resources.The humanitarian situation in Palestine has become increasingly brutal. The U.S. has performatively airdropped some supplies in (38,000 meals for 2,000,000+ people), but borders remain blocked, and humanitarian organizations have been de-funded, with UNRWA infamously being cut off after about a dozen of its thousands of employees were allegedly involved with October 7th, an asinine and malicious decision even if these allegations were true. A dozen out of thousands (who were immediately fired after the allegations were made) does not justify cutting funding while the people who depend upon aid from this organization are being starved and bombed. Military operations with high civilian casualties beyond what can reasonably be considered unintentional and actively minimized continue to happen in supposed safe zones, and civilians are shot by the IDF while trying to get food from aid trucks to feed their families. It is beyond horrifying.The immediate power to stop this with a permanent ceasefire and significant measures taken to prevent oppression during supposed peaceful times lies in political and economic leaders, so pressure them however you believe best: research boycotts, petitions, protests, etc. And donate and share humanitarian resources if you can; I know times are tough, but even if you’re not able to donate yourself, whatever aid gets through is worth it.www.map.org.uk/donatewww.palestinercs.org/endonorbox.org/help-distribute-aid-save-humans-in-gazawww.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gazawww.unicef.org.uk/donate/children-in-gaza-crisis-appealwww.msf.org/palestinewww.pcrf.netwww.gofundme.com/f/careforgaza",1,dune-part-two

63801,"If you know me, you know I love Japanese cinema that’s not only from the 50s & 60s, but also takes place during the era around the 16th century. Ugetsu is one I’ve always seen on those ‘best films’ lists that I knew I’d get to at some point, but I also never really dug deep on the plot. Honestly almost any well regarded film that fits those parameters is gonna be right up my alley. And it certainly was, and not really knowing much about it really enhanced my experience. What started off as a drama about the perils of war and the folly of man evolved into something that completely took me by surprise. It still certainly deals with those themes throughout, along with love and loss and traversing the aftermath of tragedy, and all those themes and aspects are masterfully executed by everyone involved. Heartbreaking performances, beautifully shot scenes, and unnerving music accentuated the ups and downs of our main characters, and while their journeys were wrought with hardships, the story is one that still resonates as people continue to struggle to find their way today. There are a couple other films by Kenji Mizoguchi that I’ve long been interested in besides Ugetsu, and I really look forward to digging deeper into his filmography.",8,ugetsu
59643,"Included In Lists:Strong Performances - Peter FinchI have always had this affinity towards the creation behind an art form, notably television and film, exposing the tools they utilise and the agendas that its artistic or corporate players push in delivering a particular product; that is why Aaron Sorkin’s The Newsroom locked my affections from the moment it began and that Singin’ in the Rain leaves me in an immense glee with each passing viewing. It is one of the few environments that would easily engage me in the world of politics and economics, two elements of modern civilisation that I cannot swiftly gain a grasp on, yet in films like Sidney Lumet’s Network, its themes do not appear as daunting and my thoughts are constantly provoked.Network is a film that follows a relatively simple thread of a news anchor, Peter Finch’s Howard Beale, has been led to a state of mental crumble, inefficient to attend to his work with logicality and traditional dignity, a loose canon that has shook the foundations of his television studio. Though rattled at first, eventually the positive statistics that coincide with his unfiltered madness has brought incentives by the executives and interested parties to invest on him, to exploit his ramblings in order to gain top reign of the competitive pool. His closest friend and boss, Max Schumacher (William Holden), resists the philosophy of Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), who promotes the idea of chaos in favour for immediate efficiency, yet a romantic shroud swallow the two individuals, conflicting with the marriage of the former.The characters that we were presented were brilliant in their construction upon the writing process, as they feel like true inhabitants of the world of media, emphasised slightly for the sake of dramatisation, symbolic in their presence, and deep in their substance. They are tightly compacted and exposed to us in patient but generous doses, we are allowed witness to multiple shades that ultimately paint their portraits, and their existence is further highlighted with the hard-hitting themes that Lumet attempts to project upon his audience. A film could have singularly focused on the ambitious and socially destructive construct of Dunaway’s Diana, or the claustrophobically pressured ranking of Robert Duvall’s Frank Hackett, or the mourning eyes of dignified media through Holden’s Max, or the corruptible and frightening power of Finch’s Beale, but instead Lumet inserts each character within the fold and somehow allowed every cast member to flesh out their respective roles and leave us by its end, something remarkable.If Network had a creaking hinge, it would be in the occasional hiccups of the dialogue, with some instances coming off as far too on the nose with its metaphorical delivery, leaving an artificial after-taste behind, although helpful in allowing the narrative ideas to spread their wings, but in fabricating a reflection of reality, it is a step off course, and it would have been much more beneficial if used more sporadically.There is not much else to state other than Network is one of the most fascinating films of the 1970s, and representing another assured notch in Lumet’s career, a filmmaker that has proven himself beyond the changing times of cinema as he still manages to find that spot that gauges its audience like very filmmakers do, a quality that was palpable since his celebrated debut film, 12 Angry Men.",8,network

67277,"The bulk of this movie is a 3.5 to me, but that last 15 minutes is easily 5 star territory, so 4 it is!Samurai movies are just my jam. I absolutely love the visual aesthetics, which transition so seamlessly between utter stillness and blistering speed. The plots offer so much unexplored depths, where the scenes are as much or more about what is not being said than what is.Samurai Rebellion is a slow burn. You see a drawn sword in the opening scene, but it's a long while until you see another one. The intervening scenes are filled with slowly ratcheting tension, as the competing factions try to get what they want while saving as much face as possible.I think the biggest issue I had with it is that, outside of the ending sequence, the cinematography felt very plain. There was an interesting sequence wherein Ichi's story was being recounted, and there was a stuttering, disjointed take on the action which was very interesting. It was almost evocative of woodblock printing. Unfortunately that was not carried throughout.Toshiro Mifune is masterful, as expected, but at no point does it rise to the level o his performances in pretty much any Kurosawa film.Definitely recommended for any fans of 1960s Japanese cinema or samurai films in general.",7,samurai-rebellion

56511,"Rotten Tomatoes: 100%Metacritic Metascore: 96IMDb: 8.596/100Release Date: 25 February 1936Distributor: Charles Chaplin ProductionsBudget: $1.5MWorldwide Gross: $457KTotal Film Awards: 4SYNOPSIS: The Tramp struggles to live in modern industrial society with the help of a young homeless woman.Chaplin's iconic incarnation of the 'The Tramp' is one of the most beloved characters in film history, and this is by far my favorite 'Tramp' film in the series.TRIVIA: (at around 1h 20 mins) Charles Chaplin allows the Tramp to speak on camera for the first time during the restaurant scene, but insisted that what the Tramp says be universal. Therefore, the song the Tramp sings is in gibberish, but it is possible to follow the story he tells by watching his hand gestures.Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective consciousness of modern film that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film.TRIVIA: (at around 48 mins) Charles Chaplin devoted eight days to filming the department store roller-skating scene where he skates blindfolded on the edge of the fourth floor, coming within inches of falling over the edge into the deep stairwell below. The dangerous large drop was actually a painted scene on a pane of glass carefully placed in front of the camera to align with the existing set and create the illusion of great height.Despite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.TRIVIA: The film originally ended with Charles Chaplin's character suffering a nervous breakdown and being visited in hospital by the gamin, who has now become a nun. This ending was filmed, though apparently only still photographs from the scene exist today (they are included in the 2003 DVD release of the film). Chaplin dropped this ending and shot a different, more hopeful ending instead.As we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).TRIVIA: This was one of the films which, because of its political sentiments, convinced the House Un-American Activities Committee that Charles Chaplin was a Communist, a charge he adamantly denied.He takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.TRIVIA: Shooting silent allowed Charles Chaplin the option of cranking the camera at any speed he wanted, sixteen, eighteen, or twenty-four frames per second. This allowed him flexibility of rhythm and movement in any scene.This is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as ""The Gamin"" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.TRIVIA: The factory boss was modelled on Henry Ford. Charles Chaplin had met Ford and had seen his industry-changing assembly line process, which had an obvious influence on the film.It is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than ninety, that's right, ninety years ago.TRIVIA: Another inspiration for the film was a conversation that Charles Chaplin had with Mohandas K. Gandhi, who complained about how machines were taking over. Chaplin told Gandhi, ""I grant that machinery with only the consideration of profit has thrown men out of work and created a great deal of misery, but to use it as a service to humanity ... should be a help and benefit to mankind."" But as they discussed it, Chaplin came to realize it was the first part of his statement-machinery that only considers profits has created a great deal of misery-that mattered most. Gandhi had convinced him without even trying.And this story of modern times, like all of Chaplin's films, will end up with an optimistic feeling in an unhappy end. Never is everything lost. The final image of the film even refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world.DIRECTOR: Charles ChaplinWRITER: Charles ChaplinFILMING LOCATIONS: Santa Clarita, California You have to see this movie before you can understand anything about the art of cinema.What part of the story told by the movie was the most powerful?

67502,"The only thing colder than Alain Delon’s demeanor is the Parisian streets he strolls on. Even a samurai sword would be jealous of his coolness. Le Samouraï is minimalistic, yet stylish and atmospheric. I’m not sure if anyone who has seen this movie felt the same as I did, but I felt sad towards the end. It evoked a profound sense of melancholy, echoing through the solitude of its lead character. Alain Delon’s portrayal of a detached hitman makes a haunting story, revealing the price of a life lived in the shadows, where every shadow becomes a sad reminder of the loneliness that accompanies the pursuit of a cold and calculated existence.My interest for this movie rose after watching David Fincher’s The Killer.

The characters don’t have anything that stands out to me, the dialogue feels like they just read it directly off the paper 90% of the time. Even some of the shots are just plain and not interesting to look at with exceptions (ik this was done on purpose) Now to me all of the above doesn’t matter compared to thematic depth. Which I wish I could say something on but I literally have no idea what this movie is trying to communicate is it..that you cannot live a true life without sacrifices?Is it a plea for humans to have faith in humanity?🤷‍♂️ It just feels like rambling most of the time a perfect example being the backdrop of the movie with the old guy (I forgot his name) and his son Alexander (that’s the kid right?) it looks so beautiful basically I was melting into the screen but I just can’t get over the dialogue of him going on a rant like no human just goes on like that. I’m sure Tarkovsky has something important to say and thought provoking but it just gets lost in translation. I hate to be that one guy that hates on a popular movie especially certain directors but I just can’t get into this when this style is the foundation everything so it completely falls apart for me. Idk man I’m kinda frustrated with Tarkovsky and his films I’ll still watch his other stuff, hell maybe I’ll come back and laugh at how dumb I was on a rewatch.TLDR : I just didn’t understand this movie Edit:also wanted to add this is probably riddled with grammar errors it’s past midnight for me I’ll fix it tomorrow sorry about that",3,the-sacrifice

I honestly don’t know how someone can 5* this movie without thinking it’s simply because they want to remember their 7 + hours spent fondly instead of being bored out of their mind between meaningless long takes and a downright dull story. Anyone who gives it a 5 is most likely lying to themselves and are probably forcing the hell out of it. I wanted to turn this off as soon as that bitch kid started to torture the poor cat. And then she fucking killed it. And then she proceeded to get what she deserved!!! Even if Tarr swears the cat wasn’t actually killed, he still had a live cat hung in rope for no reason. I was crying for help for that poor cat. There is one scene where the dude screams plodding for 30 straight minutes and it almost made me turn it off. People watched this film and unironically said “hey that’s a great scene in one of my favorite films ever.”Is there a lot to appreciate from purely filmmaking aspects? Of course there is. Does that mean I automatically should make it one of my favorites? Absolutely not. Tarr could’ve told this story in 2 hours and the end result would still be the same.",4,satantango
62996,"I understand why this is one of the most famous and influential films of all time, and I appreciate it for those reasons. It's beautifully made, with iconic sets and set pieces and an exciting, vibrant world captured within. Basically everything visual about this movie is incredible and vital to film history and cinema on the whole. But...as an entertaining movie Metropolis did not engage me at all. I found it dull and far too slowly paced (and let me be clear this is not an issue I have with silents, I've liked almost every single silent movie I have seen) and the characters fell extremely flat. Even the main character Freder is hardly established past being an early cinematic example of a chosen one trope. Brigitte Helm's Maria was interesting because of her strong religious beliefs, but I really disliked Helm's performance as The Machine Man, besides the legendary dance sequence of course.As for the major theme of the movie, classism and class commentary, I didn't find this to be a particularly in depth or thoughtful examination of the issue. First, the main character is the son of the creator of Metropolis, the man who exploits the working class of the city. While I think having the main character and hero of the story be from the richest family in Metropolis could have worked, it instead is frustrating because he feels like a wealthy savior of the poor who are too brainwashed to organize on their own. The movie doesn't trust the working class to be able to think for themselves and instead paints them as a mob that is easily manipulated, a sea of faces only defined as ""the hands"" of the city. The ending makes this all the more egregious, with Freder serving as the mediator (the heart) between the ""head"" (his villainous father) and the ""hands"" (the people his father works to death). Come on working class people who are being worked to death and forced to live underground! Join hands with your oppressor who just tried to drown your children and everything will be okay! Truly a toothless ending.",4,metropolis
48312,"Julian was wrong. She thought it could be peaceful. But how can it be peaceful when they try to take away your dignity?Before my thoughts about the movie, I would like to talk about what the movie made me think about. Throughout the movie, I wondered if our world had become as scary as it was in the movie, would I put my life on the line for the future of the world? I guess I'll never know the definitive answer. It's a difficult question. It is difficult not to give up hope in the world when there are so many wars in the world, when people die in different terrible ways in different parts of the world every day, when hundreds of women are raped and children are abused. I never had a social media account until I opened a letterboxd account last year. I met people from so many different countries here. And they were all very kind to me. Some of them were much older than me, I was even the age of some of their children, but despite this, I always met very understanding and sweet people. And maybe we all had one thing in common: we loved watching movies! I don't know, this alone is reason enough for me to look more favorably on the world and humanity. So I think the answer to the question I wrote at the beginning would be yes. Just hearing a baby voice like in the movie can convince me to do good for the worlds future. As for the movie, it was interesting even though it was slow. I generally like dystopia more in books, so I wasn't too impressed by the movie. But I liked the subject and the way they handled it. It was also satisfactory from a cinematographic point of view. Great for dystopia lovers!",6,children-of-men
79540,"Boring movie that took me five days to finish.  The puzzle is how it could get an average of 4.1/5 with inconsistent style, overreliance on dialogue, pointless scenes, and a few shots that are needlessly ""artsy.""  Essentially, to be reductive about the plot, this movie is about a man who is a real jerk who needs a face.  He meets a scientist, who is a greater jerk, and who breaks laws to help him get the face.  Each of these nasty characters make this movie all too unpleasant.The first shot of an X-Ray talking is really neat, and the shots of the faceless masses at the end are the best in the movie, but it is a chore to endure the in-between stuff. The portrayal of the scientist as the one true representative of ""Big Bad Scary SCIENCE!"" is so overwrought that someone needed to cool down the director's burning hate for science.The treatment of ""the man without a face"" material is not done well here, when compared to numerous science-fiction stories which do wonders with similar premises.  Clearly, Wells' ""The Invisible Man"" is in play, but go read Jack Vance's ""The Moon Moth"" or even the entire ""Book of the New Sun"" by Gene Wolfe for really great literary/philosophical treatments of this material.But there is a good science-fiction movie here, about 35-40 minutes worth, contained within 2 hours of tedium.  Some aspiring filmmaker, or even Charlie Brooker of ""Black Mirror,"" should mine the premise and the plot.  With a faster pace, and the additional of facial recognition technology, you could make this a whiz-bang short film or TV episode.  There's intriguing philosophical discussions here within this movie's premise; it's too bad that they relied on unsophisticated dialogue and New-Wave stylistic choices that make little sense.",2,the-face-of-another

49428,"The near-unanimous acclaim of this on here is definitely somewhat lost on me but I don't seem to be alone in wondering whether it’s appraisal as the greatest film of all time (currently sitting at #1 on Letterboxd’s top 250!) will wane after this gets a wide release. The ultimately very humanist core at the centre of this film concluding with an unabashedly sincere note on familial connection is the kind of whitepilled platitude I genuinely like to see, in spite of the cliched generational trauma-inflicted Asian tiger mum/daughter dynamic it’s packaged in. To get to there, however, the Daniels insist on belabouring every attempted gag in their much-touted multiverse to the point of absolute exhaustion. It isn’t enough to just make a suggestive aside about the appearance of an award resembling a butt plug—it has to later be literally used as such not once, but twice. And the hot dog fingers lost their novelty perhaps the second time I had to see them, let alone the fifth (or sixth?). Not only does Chekov’s gun have to go off—to the Daniels, it has to blow up in someone's face, be somehow reconstructed, and then blow up again. It doesn’t help that their lolsorandom sensibilities are almost antithetical to mine, featuring a brand of comedy I can only adequately describe as Reddit. Not too dissimilar to site-favourite Rick and Morty, which I’m sure served as a point of reference for its multiverse hijinks—a concept now apparently part of our cultural zeitgeist. Thankfully this doesn’t share the show’s tired outlook on nihilism. Although, when the film does try to tackle philosophy, its exploration of the universal ideas of determinism vs. free will is again about as subtle as a sledgehammer, literally (and I mean that in the very literal sense) spelling out its ideas through bolded subtitles as if it were some deep psychological insight.For all the supposed ambition and its commitment to form, it’s hard to buy the film’s surrealist flourishes when everything feels so familiarly constructed, from the verse-hopping mechanics down to the googly eyes. And I hate to make this comparison, but this sort of all-out maximalism works better in the hands of someone like Richard Kelly, who, in Southland Tales leaves it to the audience to piece together the insane bombardment of phenomena to ourselves. Take a shot every time you hear something in the vein of “statistical anomaly” used by a character here to explain an action—okay you may not be shitfaced, you’d have like… 3, maybe 4 shots, but that’s 3 or 4 too many. Again, talented surrealists like Obayashi or Bunuel know to keep us scratching our heads in wonderment, the Daniels don’t. The somewhat less talented, like Kaufman, would succumb to their aesthetic insecurities leading them to overexplain things (see: Synecdoche, New York) but at least there’s something interesting there underpinning everything, which isn’t something I can really say for EEAAO. It even feels like the film knows this and tries  to make up for it by padding its runtime—which I really started to feel around the halfway mark—by repeatedly introducing additional complications to feign complexity as it approaches a resolution. But in a 'universe' where practically anything goes, the stakes are predictably nil, and I'm just left waiting for the conclusion I knew was coming after seeing the first 20 minutes. It was fun to see the influences this seems to wear on its sleeve, but after the credits rolled and I saw the names responsible for producing this, the cynic in me couldn’t help but feel like they were ultimately typically Marvel references repurposed to suit the arthouse crowd who can point and say—like Captain America—that they “understood that [Wong Kar-wai] reference”. Which is fitting for what very well could be a Marvel movie for the A24 audience.",3,everything-everywhere-all-at-once
79218,"One can take a look at the title plus the poster and instinctively know what The Face of Another is about. Here are some quotes from the self-defeating protagonist:I wonder of losing one’s face deranges one’s senses.and…A man without a face is free only when darkness rules the world.and…I want to extinguish every last light in the world, or gouge out all of humanity’s eyes.and…I told myself a million times the [face] was only a layer of skin, a surface.and last but not least much blather with…The face is the door to the soul. When the face is closed off, so too is the soul. Nobody is allowed inside. The soul is left to rot, reduced to ruins. It becomes the soul of a monster, rotten to the core. I feel as if I’ve been buried alive. Guess what? Those are samples taken from the opening ten minutes alone! I became all too aware just a few minutes in that the rest of the film I’ll be hearing citations from the author from beyond the screen, leaving nothing to the viewer’s philosophical imagination. It gets worse when the protagonist is all too chummy with his pedantic doctor who seems to dwell more on shrink advice than he does perform plastic surgery.The script, based on a Kobo Abe novel, arrives at one of those “high” dilemmas if the protagonist, with a new face, should test his wife’s fidelity and murder her if she shall fail – all drawn out with such long-winded pontification that it made me long for the quicksilver thrills of, say, 1997’s “Face/Off” or the pruned storytelling economy of a Twilight Zone episode like 1964’s “The Masks,” both of which I now have a renewed appreciation.There’s a B-story here involving a young girl who has an immaculate profile on her left side before she turns her head to reveal the disfigured other side, certainly a subplot that has less talk / more show, and as a result has more visual creativity than the diffuse A-story. When it cuts to her, it’s almost too compact and I suppose I wished for more. The A-story though is so cumbersome it even contains a lengthy scene where the protagonist and doctor go out in public to scavenger hunt for a human subject who can provide a mold for a face, and I’m thinking, Goddamn, couldn’t a way been found to cut this scene out of the script so we don’t have to sit through every literal narrative stitch? The huge disappointment here with The Face of Another is that I went in knowing that it had been directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara, whose previous film “Woman in the Dunes” is one of the greatest works of art ever created, something I have felt for many years. Something held me back to check out this subsequent work. My resistance all these years to hold back from checking this out as it turns out had been right.",2,the-face-of-another

To me the real genius of Into the Spider-Verse wasn't in Miles but the older, jaded Peter B who like the audience has seen this play out before, but through mentoring Miles the wonder of Spider-Man is reignited for both him and us. It playfully makes fun of the repetitiveness of these stories and the fact we'd seen him cinematically rebooted three times in 15 years, but it's also a sincere celebration of the character with a deep understanding of what makes him work. It somehow ends up feeling entirely fresh and wholly, infectiously joyful. It might be the single best piece of Spider-Man media in his entire 60 year history. This one meanwhile is so utterly bogged down in IP baggage and meta commentary that the central conflict is a literal disagreement over canon (actual term used). Our Miles, we're told, is canonically non-canon yet still subject to unchangeably canon Spider-Man events despite his universe having already had its canonical Spider-Man live them out. Also if you're wondering, Peter B in this one is relegated mostly to being comic relief and getting told off by Jessica Drew, who's been made black and pregnant in this incarnation. It seems white and male spidermen are an exceedingly rare anomaly in the multiverse, contrary to what previous media may have implied, yet something as specific as the death of a ""police captain who's close to Spider-Man"" (actual phrasing again) is a multiversal constant. Huh.I can't be the only one utterly exhausted with the multiverse conceit in films at this point or how arbitrary its rules are. It's always whatever is needed to both force some conflict and enable optimal Familiar Thing Recognition (another thing mostly avoided in the previous film). We entered yet another timeline and things are the same but different! Your old favorite characters are still around we can trot them out to distract you from our creative inertia! How many times are we going to see this and still be expected to find it interesting? At least Rick and Morty employs its nihilistic multiverse toward the goal of all-out bonkers sci-fi, things you couldn't come up with yourself in one staid brainstorming session. If it had its premiere today it would be all about checklisting every other Adult Swim property you can recognise. Incidentally the one Familiar Thing that might have amused me (Nicholas Hammond, or maybe Supaidaman) doesn't make the cut but wouldn't have improved anything anyway. Some people actually fucking clapped when Insomniac's Spider-Man was given his (main, but actually second or third) shout-out, this time with an asterisk'd info box making sure you know exactly where he's from. Evidently I'm the weird one but I'm thoroughly unimpressed by a film acknowledging the existence of another okay piece of art, least of all when it's clearly an ad - Insomniac's Spider-Man 2 being the only thing Sony has PS5 owners looking forward to, and this being a Sony film. That's the most egregious example but the whole film is laced with this kind of low level corporate-product sensibility that for some reason even 'boxders eat up so long as it's Spider-Man doing it.Middle films are an awkward entity and often the weakest link for me, from Back to the Future Part II to The Matrix Reloaded, they tend to be technically impressive and high on spectacle but also overly hectic and lacking a satisfying core - also true here, not only do no arcs get any conclusions but it undoes the beautiful ending of the first film for more plot. This may well be tied up in the next one in a way that justifies the build up and the undoing, but the fact I even have to hold back my criticism for the sake of yet another sequel alone is killing me and the rest of it leaves me too pessimistic to give the next installment the benefit of doubt. Or maybe I'm just still feeling the burn from foolishly assuming the set ups of The Last Jedi would lead anywhere in episode 9. Of course it's not all bad, this is undeniably a gorgeous film to look at, almost distractingly so at times. For better or worse it's very obvious they're trying really, really hard to impress you visually in every frame. Both villains are good and there's endearing moments to make you feel for Miles and Gwen even though the payoffs are delayed for the next film. Indian Spider-Man was my favorite of the new recruits and even though we only briefly visit his dimension I'm willing to take his word for it that Mumbattan is indeed the best Spider-Man city. I enjoyed the slower pace of the first half and the broader and more immersive window it provides into Miles' world - his chromatically aberrated Brooklyn being essential to the first film's character but that film being so tightly paced that we never get to soak it in like we do here. Also appreciated Miles' insanely hot mom getting drastically more screen time. In many ways it's head and shoulders above the rest of Marvel's slop but I also find myself continually less willing to give them a pass as these films get increasingly inert and interchangeable, and they continue to insist on undoing the few triumphs they get.I readily admit much of my issues with this film come down to my own cynicism having blossomed and calcified since the first film's release. In 2018 I still had residual longing to live in a big city and attend a school like Visions, this time I was comparatively immune to wanting to be a part of the world I was seeing (rather I was checking my watch, mentally subtracting from the run time and wondering how it was still going). But, crucially, the previous film was focused on cutting through exactly that kind of fatigued pessimism. This one only further submerges you in it.",1,spider-man-across-the-spider-verse

55114,"The importance of this film is undeniable. It stands as a transitional point from neorealism (which catalogued the poverty of postwar Italy) to a glitzy carnival of avarice (which Fellini set as the new standard of Italian cinema for moving beyond the country's fascist past). Where Neorealist films were shot in the streets, LA DOLCE VITA turned to florid imagery and expensive sets to mirror the shallow materialistic lifestyle of the times. Fellini is doing for Italy what Fassbinder did for Germany. They're both targeting the failure and moral decay of postwar reconstruction, and documenting the spiritual drift that led many people to live empty, insulated, decadent lives. Unlike Fassbinder, Fellini uses a surrealistic (not humanistic) narrative structure to indict celebrity culture and society's obsession with tabloids. He tells this story through a series of disconnected vignettes, all which aimlessly float from one encounter to the next, exhausting and wandering in nature. This is not a film you enjoy. It's one you ruminate on to better understand how a country had emerged from the jaws of fascism only to settle into the jowls of hedonism. LA DOLCE VITA's world is shamelessly narcissistic and depraved, a war-torn landscape filled with sleazy movie stars, corrupt politicians, unfulfilled journalists, and swarming paparazzi, all who are quilted together by drugs and orgies through empty and forgotten spaces. The palatable sense of unease, boredom, and alienation is felt in every frame. Watching nearly 3 hours of this is enough to make you slit your wrists. And I almost did. I respect this film for its history and ideas, and even its dreamy narrative structure, but man does it roam, tax, and glacially dull you. Its power and ability to provoke lies precisely in the era from which it surfaced, but to me that just means it's much more fascinating to talk about than watch. The story Fellini wants to tell is not only important, it's compelling, but the way he tells it is so elliptically dry and repetitive. Which makes LA DOLCE VITA a really singular historical document but really poor narrative. There's definitely some potent imagery throughout (especially the beginning and ending Christ/monster iconography), but the imagery ultimately can't bear under the weight of Fellini's tedious storytelling. I'm no stranger to surrealism either. Lynch, Buñuel, and Jodorowsky have fascinated me for years, each creating intoxicating, weird-as-hell environments that draw out some of the most powerful emotions I've cinematically experienced. Fellini's brand of surrealism here doesn't make the cut. And so I have my suspicions about LA DOLCE VITA. Take away its novelty, its first of a kind to grind against the neorealist grain; take away its excessive praise and Criterion endowment, and I wonder: What would cinephiles see in this film?Fellini Ranked",4,la-dolce-vita

The downside to that is obviously sacrificing my personal relationships and becoming more detached, isolated and most likely unpleasant. The conclusion I’ve been reaching lately is that life’s too short. The legacy I leave behind after I die is not as important as what i do with my life while I’m alive.

72005,"From a visual standpoint this movie is heavenly. With its set design, colours, and specifical effects all set the mood for you to fall in love. Yet the plot is just...meh In set up it is immediately recognizable to soul where a clerical error allows our protagonist to get a second taste of life. But where Soul left me in tears, A Matter of Life and Death left me frustrated. The whole reason for our protagonists desire to keep on living is that he has fallen in love with a woman. The problem is that the love just feels empty. We see a brief connection and the beginning but after the 10 minute mark or so the movie seems to find it unimportant to spend anymore time further developing this relationship that is literally a matter of life or death, until the end of the movie. Instead we spend the majority of the runtime trying to sort out the guys trial and his physical health. In a movie about wanting to stay alive, it made the whole process look rather grueling than worth fighting for.Also the argument of the prosecution is absolutely ridiculous. It had no correlation to the matter at hand and was so unbelievable that I was actually thinking that there is no way all these ""imaginary"" mystical figures would even allow it in an imaginary metaphysical courtroom. Like his life literally hinged on the idea that ""hmmm we did mess up on our end, but he is British so maybe we should kill him anyways"" and that ""She can't be in love with a Brit, she's American"". The politics in that argument just felt so forced in this scenario. If you wanted to make that the message of your film, maybe make a different movie.I know this is a beloved film and I can see why a lot of people hold it dear. It has a lot going for it. I think I am just frustrated because it's approach to the subject matter was the complete opposite of what I hoped it would be. At least I liked the first 10 minutes.",4,a-matter-of-life-and-death

Sure, this guy LOVES his work, he LOVES Van Morrison and he LOVES Patti Smith, he loves Faulkner and he drinks coffee in the morning and life is good and we should all appreciate it and we should all find beauty in its monotonousness, etcetcetc. Yeah yeah but why present such a basic theme in the most boring, awkward, borderline fetishized looking-down-from-above way possible? Faceless characters that lack any kind of character, and don’t get me started on the irksome portrayal of the (young) female characters. It’s no surprise to me that this is directed by some old German fart who should’ve probably retired long ago because this reeks white man fantasy.

27423,"Hirokazu Kore-eda has carved a lane for himself as one of few directors capable of rendering children endearing and sympathetic rather than the unbearable resource vacuums that they normally are. Part of what makes his child characters so agreeable is his ability to write them in such a way that they don't feel like shuffling tantrum machines (perhaps owing to the fact that Japanese culture in general is far more geared towards respect than those of us across the Pacific), nor like obnoxious mouthpieces for what are obviously an adult's words. Nobody Knows finds Kore-eda showing us what he can accomplish when the children in question are forced into those adult shoes not out of misguided cuteness, but as a matter of necessity.Resting an entire film on the shoulders of a handful of quiet tikes may just be the biggest cinematic gamble since... whatever Jodorowsky last made prior to 2004, but Kore-eda's sincere approach bleeds empathy in such a way that very little needs to be said. Every angle; every perspective shot; every facial expression heartbreakingly illustrates just what these kids are missing out on in life, forced to sit tight and watch their childhoods pass them by in real-time while they fend for themselves. 14-year-old Yūya Yagira takes centre-stage as the eldest of these four neglected half-siblings, and by the time the film ends, his being the youngest person ever to win an acting award at Cannes should surprise no one. Without ever breaking down into histrionics, Yagira perfectly captures the strife of having to look after his younger siblings, all the while needing to keep up the illusion that mommy is definitely coming home. It's a position that elicits frustration, fear and uncertainty in equal measure, and keeping that wrapped up under a veneer of fragile stoicism is probably the best way to get the point across through the eyes of a child needing to pretend he has it all together for the sake of his kin.Kore-eda's films operate under an air of ebullience that almost always masks a grim familial position, and Nobody Knows is perhaps his most direct undertaking of this approach (and, some might say, his best). The present-day Japanese auteur has often drawn comparisons to one of Japan's earlier pioneers of the art form, Yasujirō Ozu. But while his airy approach to family discord certainly recalls the style of the man who basically made Late Spring 5 times, Kore-eda has gone on-record to say that he draws more influence from the works of Ken Loach. Beyond his ability to continuously throw unsuspecting gut-punches into his work, Nobody Knows probably brings Kore-eda closer to Loach than he's ever been before, as this sheer level of bleakness is almost too much for his lighthearted aesthetic to balance out. In the end though, as he always does, Kore-eda manages to find his perfect pitch, reaching a harmony in presentation that offsets the disharmony of his characters' lives.Kore-eda Ranked.The Zero Misses Club.",9,nobody-knows

16695,"Black and White Movies Ranked* A masterpiece* I loved how Bergman focusses on faces. Loved the whole artistry, the music, the shots and the story. * I saw three kinds of meaning in this movie. Literal, metaphorical and the third one is a spoiler. * I am only writing part of my literal interpretation here in the non spoiler section. I don't think most of the meaning I saw in the movie is a spoiler. But I don't want to deny the opportunity for anyone to interpret it themselves. There's such a pleasure in that. * Part of the literal interpretation - The protest of Elisabet Vogler means a lot to me. I too am a lot of the times disgusted with what constitute human life and the horrors I see on the world. Above all I am disguted with myself for participating in such a life and world. (Of course I have philosophical answers to such problems. They keep me in the game) But my point is I can understand and identify with her anger which leads to her protest. A lot of philosophical dialogues (which I really loved) first by the doctor, then in a book read by Alma says these points. I was glad to see such a movie. The protest is a great political statement too as becomes apparent. Most of us are in constant denial of the horrors of the world, every single day. It helps us to move forward. But Elisabet reminds me a part of myself which wants to scream and protest against life in general and societal institutions. (Then I watch movies, in a way like how Mank gets drunk, and forget myself 😂). So Persona shows me the meaningful problems for which Persona itself is the main solution for me. 😂SPOILER POINTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!BELOW I WRITE SPOILER POINTSThere is a huge gap between the spoiler points and the bottom of the review. * My metaphorical interpretation of the movie. -  The actress is our unconscious mind and the nurse is our conscious mind. The former is always silent and the latter is always talking to it. We also attempt to interpret our unconsious (what are our exact desires and feelings, why we have these emotions etc) like the nurse wants the actress to talk. But she is unsuccessful except for making her say the word 'nothing' at the end. It shows our failure to ever really understand our unconsious. Because of it's deafening silence the most honest interpretation is that it really means 'nothing'. Of course that's still our interpretation and it may not be true. But like the nurse makes the actress say that word, that is the best we can do. The 'hate my own child' scene shows our conversation with the unconsious perfectly. We ask it, is this the meaning? There is no response. So we make up a story and interpretation and hope that it is the meaning. Like the nurse does. She seems sure. But is it possible to really know that is  the truth? Looking deep and adamantly into our unconsious is dangerous. It drinks our blood eventually. As is shown in the movie literally. It ruins our life, suicide will seem like a genuine way forward. As Nietzsche wrote, if you look deep into the abyss, it also looks back at you. As a great philospher who deeply thought about life and eventually went mad, I think he knows what he is talking about. So as suggested in the movie, the best way forward from deep introspection, is to slap the crap out of the unconsious 😂. Kidding, in other words just forget about too much introspection, ignore the unconsious and move on with our lives, to focus on what to do rather than what to think. After the slap scene, the actress and the nurse go their separate ways. Like the conscious mind and unconsious ought to do after an intense attempt to make it 'talk'. The eroticism of the whole movie shows the sexual thoughts you encounter during deep introspection. Sexual thoughts and urges are a constant companion when we go deep into us. Alma's story sounds more like well construed porn from a straight male point of view than anything realistic. The sensuality between two woman (from my straight male point of view) again shows how dominant sexual thoughts are when we try to introspect. To conclude - I think the main philosophical message of the movie is this. It is not good for us to try to figure it all out intellectually. It is a dangerous process if we keep at it. Look at what happened to Nietzsche. It is better to move on with our ACTIONS rather than focus intensely on THINKING. We have to act with the burden of not knowing everything fully. But that is the best option. * My interpretation of the first scenes which come again in between the movie and the end -The projector is turned on. The filmmaker starts to create his story. The spectacled boy represents Bergman or any writer/artist. The process of creation is filled with all the things we encounter during life and especially during the process of creation. Comedy, sex, the spider symbolise the hostility of nature, the crucifixion represent human suffering etc. After that the fimmaker/writer/artist starts to create his story and characters. As represented by the boy wiping the vague image of a woman into clarity. That is an artist trying to bring a character which is vague in his/her mind into more clarity. The picture becomes little clear and goes back to vague again. The writer gets some glimpse of the character and it become unclear again. And the movie starts. The writer is writing his story. In between the movie, it becomes unclear to the writer what to write next. Then again the comedy, sex, hostile nature, human suffering, all that happens which the writer must battle while continuing the process of creation. Again there is an attempt to make the character clear again. And she comes back to the movie character figure from an unclear image. The writes continues writing his story. The movie has ended. But the writer is still wiping the image of the character which is still unclear. Though he has written  the movie he has only explained very little of a her character. Everything else about her is still unknown to him. And even after the end of the story, there is still an attempt by the writer to figure more out about her character. Then the movie ends. Which means the writer has stopped that final attempt. * My full interpretation of the literal story - When we are alone we sometimes fanatsize about being another human being and we act out how we play him or her. Writers and artists do the same thing professionally as an antidote to the deafening silence of life. Alma does the same thing. In the absence of any response from Elisabet, she starts to talk for Elisabet and play Elisabet. It is the response to loneliness. (Think about Tom Hank's friend in Cast Away) Why Elisabet stopped her protest? She stopped it when she saw someone feel exactly like her. The doctor intellectually explained how Elisabet feels. But that wasn't enough for her. Alma by playing Elisabet showed her exactly how she feels. Alma used words like unbearable pain and nausea. And screamed. Acted it out. That is the kind of horror Elisabet feels towards life in the context of monks burning themselves dead in Vietnam or the horrors of war (that picture Elisabet looks at with soldiers pointing a gun at a child whose hands are up). The suffering of life, as becomes apparent in the 'hate my own child' scene, also lead to her protest against life. * If a movie made me write so much with a running time of about 1 hour and 20 minutes, it is truly a masterpiece for me. Elongated the review because of spoiler points. Black and White Movies Ranked",9,persona

83730,"Of course all art is subjective and I do respect that many find profound meaning in this, but I'm angry. Sorry, just disregard what I have to say.Yes, it looks gorgeous. Like all of Tarkovsky's films. Every frame could be in a museum. Cinematography, locations, FX, costume even furniture... all there to create art and evoke feeling.But the content is barely there, and what's there is laughably bad. It felt like being forced to listen to a rambling homeless man on meth. Actually that sounds more interesting.I don't know why people admire this random incoherent and melodramatic bullshit. Wait for the moment when a screaming woman pulls her tit out because the brooding Russian poet would not fuck her and then seriously tell me, that it's not total cringeworthy self aggrandizing wish fulfillment with all the gravitas of the ""Denver Clan"". Embarrassing!I've come to the point where I dread watching another Tarkovsky more than a dentist appointment - and I'm not joking. Every Tarkovsky before this had at least some standout bonkers and brilliant scene, and Andreij Rublev is mostly great, but this is such a torture to get through.So the star is for them pretty pictures. There are no characters, no story, no real people or situations, just images. People standing on hills in the fog. From time to time interrupted with discussions of poetry or philosophy (and I'm the type who enjoys watching 3 hour long lectures about that shit on YouTube - but this is just so pointless and inept.)I'm seriously baffled with people rating this kind of movie up into the heavens. If a film student would have made this, he'd failed his assignment. But it's everybody's favorite Russian Genius, so it must be brillant.

63536,"Well. I’m too depressed to write about this, but I know I need to as it’s part of the monthly watchlist. Alas. I have nothing of value to say. This is considered a classic by everyone who cares at all about movies, and beautiful essays have been written about it, especially the one for the Criterion Collection version. I’ve no defense, historically speaking, for not giving higher marks. But I can’t say I liked it just because of its cultural significance or the inevitable pressure to love what my favorite critics love. I knew nothing of this movie beforehand save for its place in Ebert’s Great Movies list. Now, after having finished it, I’m keenly aware of its place in history, but I maintain one’s opinion—good or bad—should not change out of guilt for not “getting” it or sufficiently revering its place in the past and/or cinema’s grand scheme. All the same: Children of Paradise was a largely monotonous, forgettable chore whose duration only exacerbated my disinterest. Genuinely perplexed as to why this is heralded by many as the Best Movie Ever Made (by Brando too!), though I’ve read enough now to at least be aware of the reasoning; still, though. To me, this seems like a very typical, very ordinary melodrama with its central temptress not at all fitting her role in a convincing way. I mean, she’s okay. But to have *this* level of magnetism? Yeah. Severely lacking. Might be blasphemous to say, but Kidman had more raw energy in Moulin Rouge! than Arletty does anywhere here. Quite disappointing as I was looking forward to this & it was logistically challenging to carve out such a stretch of time to be able to watch in full without interruption. Ah, well.

78368,"I can see why this film is highly regarded by some. It's stylish, well-shot, and covers a court-room drama in a punchy way. However, the story is  just not great - it's dated, and it's perspective is not smart. When the alleged rape-victim meets her lawyer, she recounts her rape in a manner so care-free she may as well have been a pre-Civil War Scarlett O'Hara flirting with an army of beaus at a barbecue. It's such an unbelievable performance whether it's masquerading as truth or a lie. The subsequent trial, includes an uncomfortable cross-examination on whether she is truly a victim, or if is she is ""bare-legged"" whore, and all the while Jimmy Stewart fights tooth and nail to defend a murderer and we never understand why that should make him the hero of our story. None of the uncomfortable aspects of the film appear to be explored in a deliberate, examining way. I think the film just thought it was smart to say - what if the flirty sexy wife LIED about rape to get her husband off murder?? WOW such cool story! I held out hope to very end that despite the negatives, there would be some ingenious twist or revelation that would have made it all worth it, but there wasn't.

45466,"#72 of 100 in my Top 100 Directors ChallengeHungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr and his co-director wife Ágnes Hranitzky operate on a different plane of reality from me. Their world is cold, bleak and austere, impoverished and removed from modern technology. Yet it is also undeniably closer to the core of human values and the possibility of existential truth, uncluttered by the white noise of commercial society, pop culture and political sound bites. They inhabit a place in time and space that both repels and attracts me. This film, based upon author László Krasznahorkai's 1989 stream-of-consciousness novel entitled ""The Melancholy of Resistance,"" takes us to an isolated Hungarian village during the Cold War Era under Soviet rule. There, we meet a young man named János Valuska (Lars Rudolph), who dabbles in poetry and earns his livelihood delivering early morning newspapers by hand. We see him entertaining drunks in a bar, putting his good friend György Eszter (Peter Fitz) to bed after midnight, and visiting the post office before dawn to pick up his papers.Meanwhile, a circus is coming to town. It's main attractions are a gigantic dead whale and a shadowy performer called ""The Prince"" (Sandor Bese), who is rumored to bring discord with him wherever he goes. A tractor pulls the barn-like metal shed housing the massive mammal into the town square under the cover of darkness, not unlike the Greeks of old delivering their mammoth wooden horse to the city of Troy.The film's title, we learn, derives from the legacy of the baroque German musical theorist Andreas Werckmeister (1645-1706), whose work emphasized harmonic principles. It seems that the intellectual György has proposed that Werckmeister's basic musical interval, the octave, is a fabrication and a contrivance, which has led us away from the ""pure and natural"" God-inspired compositions once known to the ancients.At any point, it is easy to begin trying to interpret the film's imagery and sparse dialog as allegory. Does the circus represent communist politics, distracting populations from what's important and using revolutionary dogma to disrupt the existing order? Is György's treatise on false harmony a statement of how all systems are flawed, even those which seem almost inevitable? And what of the lack of music in most scenes? Is a world devoid of harmonies one of chaos and decay? And how about the unseen Prince? Is he the Prince of Darkness?But there are no accessibility issues here. Tarr & Hranitzky hide no cards under the table. They show us György's estranged wife Tünde Eszter (Hanna Schygulla) trying to extort her husband, even as she's cheating on him with the Chief Constable (Péter Dobai). We see the disgruntled townsmen gather in the square, lighting bonfires, milling about angrily and just waiting for an excuse to riot against inhumane living conditions, the failure of public services and the lack of economic opportunity.Janos finds himself caught in this whirlwind, a reluctant messenger and a trapped bystander, wanting little more than to gaze upon the wondrous whale that represents God's mightiest creation. In the dark, he runs away from the town square, where he overheard the Prince speaking of his plan for arson, slaughter and destruction. Behind him, the town lights up with explosions, smoke and blazing flames.Armed with clubs, a mob fans out from the square into the village streets like a silent army. They wantonly attack a hospital, destroy equipment and mercilessly beat the patients. Is this passionate ignorance revolting against science? They only stop when they come upon a bony old man standing naked in a shower room. Does rage have boundaries? Janos survives as witness to the chaos, but his name ends up on a certain list, and that's not a good thing.There's more, of course, and it's not a pretty sight at all ... haunting in its striking imagery. Tarr received the Grand Prize and the ""Gene Moskowitz"" Critics Award at Hungarian Film Week, plus the László B. Nagy Award from the Hungarian Film Critics. I'm sure this will deserve a rewatch at some point, but for now I'm rating it very good, not quite great, and a tad below Tarr's ""Turin Horse"" (2011).Film #12 among my 52 Films by Women 2017",6,werckmeister-harmonies

22987,"- First, we get a black screen with diegetic nature sounds droning as the audio, pretty much enervating the audience and putting them in a  state to just passively absorb whatever is chucked at their direction (under the guise of “immersion” and “atmosphere”). Then, we get a hard cut to a shot of the sky and a tree in stop motion (and in black and white) with a much louder diegetic sound of wind clearly manipulated to be louder than the previous diegetic sound in order to make a simplistic shock response that really means nothing outside of emphasizing that “hurr durr nature and existence are loud and scary.” Hard cut to black screen with the title card in the lower right, spelled in all lowercase and small font, to seem all cutesy and shit as well as to further hammer in the apparent threatening nature of the filmmaker’s existentialist plea. Less than a minute in and this thing is already tonally annoying and smarmy.- Drawings are meant to s(t)imulate identification with a hyper-sentimentalized version of their (the audience’s) existence, with the stick figures meant to flatten the broad range of human emotion available in the human physiology into easily-consumable cutesy gestures. Bunch of small circular “frames” in a black screen with the edges of the “frame” being a gradual transition from black to white generally communicating a state of mind, with the state of mind possessing nothing but overt sentimental goopiness. Narrator’s voice is that mid-20’s or mid-30’s semi-high pitched voice to replicate a sense of meekness, which is clearly fake.- Lots of internet self-deprecating irony: the first meeting between the protagonist in a stranger has loud diegetic wind sounds suddenly explode into the audio just as the words “as they grew nearer” are said by the narrator, to bluntly emphasize the oppressive nature of engaging in a fucking conversation, but with the audio loud enough and the stick figures (plus narration) implicitly self-deprecating enough with its heightened tone to hand-wave the ridiculousness in a “haha, yeah, we *know* it’s ridiculous” as if that actually undermines the stupidity of the notion that simply communicating is an existential challenge of some kind.- Rousing music played over and contrasted with cutesy everyday shenanigans with the narrator spelling out the protagonist’s quirkiness to emphasize alienation in a modern urban landscape, but ultimately in a way that indulges in an arguably narcissistic view the self since the sentimental nature of the montage only amplifies the identification with the film’s pathetic but ""valid” protagonist.- Fucking classical music played in the background as the words “everything will be ok” in black shakes in the lower right corner in the small, whitened part of the screen -- the promise of future stability rendered unstable in the most mind-boggling literal way here (in lowercase letters + shaking) with the black words on small white part in a small part of a black screen supposed to communicate powerlessness, with the classical music supposed to further emphasize said powerlessness as if everything in the frame was not pointing to that already. Contender for worst use of classical music I have seen in a while.- Then bunch of aforementioned frames popping in and out of the screen showing our stickman protagonist going about his everyday life, with the occasional narrator’s voice breaking to further hammer in the state of the protagonist as listlessly going through his life with a degree of inexperience despite his age. Scene with the boxer’s head breaking with very loud sound effects (because louder equals better) in contrast to the protagonist talking about trivial things over the phone to make yet another bullheaded, in-your-face statement about indifference in the modern world.- “Every time he moved towards her, she would move away with a tight-lipped smile, as if everything were okay,” the narrator says, just to make this picture even more overtly sentimental and relatable now that basic emotions are spelled out with “novelistic” details, instead of letting the images speak for themselves, though there isn’t much that the images can say at this point.- Very blatant cutesy talking about morbid topics now, with super dumb contrasting such as sending your decapitated head into a rocket ship or blatantly match-cutting from a line of stickmen to a line of brains to further  emphasize existentialist whining in an ironic modality. The flippant tone in which these morbid topics are discussed, bluntly contrasted and mixed with the childish stick drawings, also emphasize just how “quirky” and “relatable” the protagonist is for the internet crowd who just want a hug or something.I could not even get past seven and a half minutes.

20610,"The Criterion Challenge 2021 #25 | Martin Scorsese’s Top 10The Red Shoes is one of the earliest examples of the classic passion versus person conflict. Enacted in stunning Technicolor, its images leap off the screen and absorb you completely. That’s where it shines, in the magnificent colors of its world and its vibrant atmosphere, because the conflict isn’t as lively or affecting as the sequences where imagination is allowed to run wild and to dance freely. Vicky Page is a young ballerina taken on by the prestigious ballet of Boris Lermontov. Initially unnoticed, she rises to the leading role in an adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Red Shoes when the leading ballerina is dramatically dismissed by Lermontov after getting engaged. This isn’t a story of a dancer seeking the validation of her perfectionist impresario; Vicky dances and her world is dance from the very beginning. The passion inside of her spills over real life, over the audience, over her very being. Lermontov deems her “good”, not “great”, but she can be great with a little dedication. He could make her great. Then, Vicky finds love alongside Lermontov’s composer, a love never as enveloping as her dancing, and Lermontov gives up on her and she accepts it. That’s the intrigue: she must choose between dance and love. But how is there even a competition? Dance is larger than life and her romance with the composer is… monotonous, constructed out of words rather than gestures or boundless imagination. The great tragedy of The Red Shoes is not so much that Vicky has to give herself up for the sake of her passion, but that we are forced to side, at least partly, with Lermontov. That the romance fails to be as compelling as the dancing, and Lermontov’s search for perfection, his jealousy and denial of Vicky’s self fail to seem completely unreasonable. Thankfully, The Red Shoes gives most of the spotlight to dance. We see Vicky dance far more than we see her love, and when she dances, she exists on a different plane. Her steps are mesmerizing and haunting and too monumental to be rivaled by monotony.",6,the-red-shoes
9163,"I get that this movie is a sacred cow for a lot of people, so let me tread carefully here.  Also, for those that haven't seen the film, SPOILERS ahead.  Given the source material, an autobiographical short story by Akiyuki Nosaka, I think the decision to have Seita die and be peacefully reconciled in the afterlife with Setsuko is deeply problematic.  Nosaka has spoken publicly about his motivations for writing the story, in which he/Seita lives, as a way of atoning for the death of Setsuko, his little sister who died of starvation after the firebombing of Kobe.  He has spoken publicly about the way he allowed his own pride and selfishness to influence his actions, which he believes directly led to her death.  By changing the ending, and by presenting the film in a naturalistic manner (otherwise a commendable choice), the film presents Seita as a victim as well, rather than, as Nosaka intended in the original story, a guilty party.Now, I'm not suggesting the film needed to punish Seita for his actions, or that it should have adopted a more scolding tone.  Rather, I'm accusing the film of taking the easy way out, of choosing, in the end, sentimentality over the kind of moral wrestling it otherwise invites when showing the graphic horrors of war.  In doing this, the film alters the original intent of Nosaka's story, and presents a moral dichotomy (WAR BAD/CHILDREN GOOD) that, while having emotional resonance, is also emotionally familiar and therefore easy.  The film falls short of the complexity I think this story demands.  Yes, Seita was a child who shouldn't have been asked to make the kinds of choices he was asked to make.  War is indeed terrible.  But in making those choices he made mistakes, and those mistakes had a tragic result for Setsuko.    I wish the film, like the short story, had acknowledged this.",1,grave-of-the-fireflies

The clues?It could be. They’re good thrills.Is it the cats?The cats are very cute but… they don’t make up for some of this bullshit.I’m just gonna get right to the point.This film is just… so fucking transphobic.Buffalo girl is obviously trans. She is trans. Don’t let this film say she isn’t. This film just goes with outdated as shit logic about trans people from the medical community. This film doesn’t get away with it’s transphobia because of one measly line explaining it away.If you think you are trans, then you are.Now that we have established that she is trans. We can talk about the fact that this film falls into the trend of horror films villainizing queer and trans people. We’re not gonna pretend that that doesn’t exist. It is so fucking common it’s becoming too much to handle. This film makes a trans woman (who mind you doesn’t pass (they surprisingly got what happens when you don’t pass a woman accurately)), the killer… the killer who “wants to be a woman” so she skins them. Fuck. Right. Off. They couldn’t come up with at least a non-transphobic reason goddamn.Also, the fact that they try using HER. A WOMAN TO TRY COMMENTING ON THE MALE GAZE? ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME????Also, this film tries at times to comment on sexism and the male gaze. But it does it so little you wouldn’t realize that’s a theme. It doesn’t even say anything new.There’s also the fact that it glorifies the police and the FBI, but… do i really need to get into that? Like fucking come on. Fuck off with your piggy ball fondling.So I ask again, why? Why do we worship films, especially ones like this, as the “greatest of all time”?The only reason this is getting shit for me is the cinematography, the “moments”, some of the acting, and the cats.Also can I just say it is SUPER uncomfy watching this in a packed theater as a non-passing trans woman wearing fem clothes.

12308,"(Catching Up on the Classics Series)A New Yorker learns that making your way to the top by helping your superiors be scum bags, is no way to live. ""Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means? ... I'm not sure ... A mensch - a human being! So you got off easy this time.""While I liked the premise and themes of Writer and Director Billy Wilder's Oscar-winning classic The Apartment, but personally I found the second half to be a real slog to get through. Fun Coincidence: Jack Lemmon's character C.C. Baxter watches some of the climax of 'Stagecoach' in this movie, which is the last film I watched.   In the story C.C. Baxter works at an insurance company in the big city. The depth of feel in the shot of his desk in this huge room full of people working looked great. And I have a feeling that Martin Scorsese was paying tribute to this shot when he put a similar set together for his film 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. We find that Baxter does not get much done at work, because he is so busy handling the schedule of the managers from his company that are taking turns using his apartment to hook up with the women they are having affairs with.I have to ask, why don't all these wealthy men just go to a hotel to have their affairs???While Baxter is seeing the perks of loaning out his apartment, it is also ruining his reputation in the building with his neighbors who think he is a promiscuous party animal. Also on at least one occasion, it cuts into his sleep/personal time when he cannot even get into his apartment since the manager stays too long and leaves him the wrong key. It's ironic that one of the offices he gets upgraded to has glass walls for everyone to see in. But the reality is that the true Baxter is not this perception that he has been giving off, due to this business with his apartment. We find out that the only thing outside of this little enterprise that interests him, is one of the elevator operators in his building named Fran played by Shirley MacLaine. Fran seems to be pretty well put together, but appearances can be misleading.""The mirror... it's broken ... Yes, I know. I like it that way. Makes me look the way I feel.""Spoilers...Turns out that Fran has been in a self-destructive relationship with one of the managers named Mr. Sheldrake, who keeps telling her they will be together once he leaves his wife. But of course, that will never happen, at least by his choice. But then Sheldrake's secretary really stirs things up when she lets Fran know she is only one in a series of women that have gone along with his extramarital escapades. ""That's the way it crumbles... cookie-wise.""That leads to the turning point of the film where Baxter finds that Fran has decided to take a bottle full of sleeping pills following her abbreviated meetup with Sheldrake in Baxter's apartment. She feels very belittled in this moment since Sheldrake gives her a hundred bucks for Christmas, and she seems to interpret that this is all he thinks she is worth to him, which is likely not far from the truth.    Baxter finds her in time and with the help of his neighbor who is a Doctor, they are able to save her life. Then a huge chunk of the film is spent with Fran and Baxter spending time together as she slowly recovers in secret at the apartment, in order to prevent Sheldrake from getting associated with her suicide attempt. I can see how some may enjoy this slowly growing love connection between Fran and Baxter and find it enduring. With these cute scenes of them playing a card game with this snappy dialogue, and him using a tennis racket to strain spaghetti. But personally, I thought it went on way too long. IDK for me Fran just got so moopy when it came to this hopeless relationship with this jerk Sheldrake, compared to how confident she was when we first meet her.Baxter’s support and him keeping his mouth shut during this whole ordeal leads him to get a sweet new office at the top of the building right next to Sheldrake. But it is not long before he decides this upgrade was simply not worth it, due to the humanity that he was loosing with being apart of likely ruining all these families, by helping these men have more affordable affairs. And him developing this conscience and no longer being a ‘pushover’ is what takes us to the film’s sweet and happy Hollywood ending.    All the acting in The Apartment is great and I really wanted to like it, but that lengthy second act really outstayed its welcome for me.Thanks for reading!Happy movie watching ...

2996,"Junesploitation: 19 - ‘80s Horror!Film #26 in my Birth Year Challenge Viewed on PlexAka Parasite 3DIn some ways the Horror aspect here is overshadowed by the setting. I could easily imagine the same film taking place in the contemporary suburbs with basically the same characters - a barman, local punks, an out of towner, the employee of fascist corporation, Demi Moore.However it is in fact set in the then-future of 1992. It is not quite post-apocalyptic but society is definitely struggling. There has been some sort of atomic event in New York and trouble rages in Los Angeles. Consequently the film takes place in the Californian desert.Produced and directed by Charles Band, this would have functioned quite well as a straight Sci-Fi film but luckily some Body Horror comes into play (with effects by Stan Winston) in the form of the titular Parasite. This is the fourth Charles Band directed film I've seen and although it is nothing amazing I quite enjoyed it as some trashy Sci-Fi/Horror.",4,parasite

60196,"Therapy as eschatology in an absurd anime spectacle of transcendental mecha combat littered with religious iconography and allusions divorced of their meaning and wrapping with a repudiation of its own existence? We've seen it before. The great irony of Anno's narrative and metanarrative resolutions, the Triumph of the WILLE and the transcending of otaku fantasy, is in their author. When he was rebuking his show's fandom with The End of Evangelion and trying to close the Pandora's Box of pathetic pop idolatry that he'd unleashed, did Anno imagine he'd be recycling the same nonsense decades in the future just to add a little more aesthetic and therapeutic satisfaction for the fans? Is emotional closure for the same old anime characters really the artistic growth to be had from twenty-something years? Whatever the case, even if this does help a few teens conquer their angst, Neon Genesis Evangelion remains a stale, bad joke.In these circumstances, maybe the typical sinister preaching in favor of the human will-to-power over submission to a divine will can be appreciated as the lament of a franchise-enslaved artist. It's not like Anno actually has a conception of the divine here; Apocalypse is only used as an allegory for social psychology, not the other way around. Such bold declarations from our WILLEful heroes as, “I have faith that humanity's will and knowledge will one day overcome the power of God” (faith in humanity is usually just a figure of speech but these kooks really buy it), and later, “Armed with knowledge and willpower, humanity has made it this far even without divine help” (unknowingly self-contradictory, that one), come across as pitiful at this point. Now that we've supposedly reached the end of End of Evangelions this time, hopefully Shinji really can shut off that projector and all the projections it entails. Hopefully that Revelation which has so captivated Anno's stylistic sensibilities will get around to captivating his soul, because elsewise he's just been grasping at the same humanist straws.",1,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time

13108,"A huge leap in ambition, creativity & execution when compared to his debut feature, Andrei Rublev presents the famous Soviet filmmaker taking on a colossal project in what's his sophomore directorial effort as he charts the life n times of the great icon painter and — through his afflictions — paints an interesting portrait of medieval Russia in order to examine themes of art, religion, freedom, political oppression & personal expression.Co-written & directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, the film employs an episodic structure to chronicle the life of its titular figure, and is told in eight chapters that are bookended by a prologue & an epilogue. The biopic aspect is only utilised as a framework here as Tarkovsky is more interested in dissecting the sociopolitical & religious elements of 15th-century Russia. All the depicted segments nonetheless contribute to Rublev's art & life by challenging his worldview.Adding to the viewing experience is the rich, dreamlike imagery that's photographed in crisp black-n-white and is furthermore elevated by fluid movements & lingering shots. But at 186 mins, all of which unfolds at a glacial pace, this film is going to be a daunting task for some viewers. Anatoli Solonitsyn plays the eponymous iconographer and is brilliant throughout. And although the story is more ruminative in presentation, it holds nothing back when portraying the gruesome acts of war, carnage & cruelty.Overall, Andrei Rublev brings a turbulent time in Russian history to cinematic life in broad brushstrokes, and succeeds in telling a simple story on an expansive canvas. Despite treading through most of the journey with a straight face, in addition to falling asleep in the middle, almost all its events did make sense in retrospect. The film's technical mastery is undeniable yet this is one of those films that I can only admire but not love, for my experience with it wasn't as eye-opening or earth-shattering as it has been for others.",6,andrei-rublev
56103,"Gotta say, really surprising! And honestly one of my preferred Reynolds films of this era, namely because aside from eventually giving into some ridiculous action it mostly interrogates the very nature of the kind of emboldened American badass he's used to playing. Its script by William Goldman doesn't skimp on the Goldman-ness, lots of character in side characters and fun dialogue, but also feels too tethered to its novel source material, making of a lot moments essentially vignettes that don't really add up to much of a character outside of his personified enigma. But it's never the film I really expect it to end up being, even to the very end, and its only really a quite absurd sense of action directing and an aversion to making its own lead into the same poetry it does with some of his run-in world inhabitants that negates its effect.",4,heat

50462,"One time I went to the park with my mom and my niece, who was 2 at the time. We were playing on the monkey bars - she laughed so hard while I held her and she pretended like she was strong enough to actually carry herself across. I put her down and she asked me for water, so I turned around to the picnic table with our bags on it to get her bottle. When I turned back around she was gone.I’ve never felt this particular kind of paralyzing fear before because I didn’t have time to soak it in before going into panic mode. I screamed for her so loudly my voice cracked and I looked frantically everywhere I could. But this park was surrounded by a huge forest and I couldn’t stop imagining her wandering in there and getting lost or someone grabbing her and running through it and I would never find her. We found her five minutes later, she had wandered off and hid under a slide. But those five minutes felt like years. I yelled so hard at her to never leave on her own because we need to always know where she is. I think she understood.This movie understands that fear and that anger. I only lost track of her for five minutes, I can’t imagine how desperate I would become if it was weeks. If my fears were real.

8737,"Watched For Film ClassThe cinema. It's the place for joy, sorrow, and love. The cinema is the place for us to live our dreams in real time; there's no boundaries in that pitch black room with the screen, everything is up to us and our imagination. The cinema is a place that I haven't been able to go to often in recent times, but is a place that I cherish nonetheless. There's films like Goodbye, Dragon Inn and Labyrinth of Cinema which are entirely about cinema itself, and those films are films that I absolutely adore. So why is it that I wasn't able to enjoy Cinema Paradiso, a film that seems to have been tailor-made for a viewer like me? I'll have to say the answer lies in the film itself, and all of its very obvious and annoying flaws that I just couldn't ignore for the entire runtime.While I understand for a lot of people the film's nostalgic and sentimental approach works, but to me it almost always feels incredibly corny or sometimes unbearable. While sentimental movies by directors like Ōbayashi or WKW take my heart and absolutely decimate it, Cinema Paradiso did nothing but make my body shiver in terror from the amount of emotional manipulation present in this film. Sure, it's not exactly a pretentious movie or anything, but it just feels so generic and run-of-the-mill, and I feel like if the film wasn't about cinema, it would've been worthless and never would've gotten the amount of awards and praise that it has gotten. Perhaps I wasn't in the right mood or this film just isn't for me, but how can anyone believe this is a masterpiece while films like Goodbye, Dragon Inn and Labyrinth of Cinema are thrown to the side and disregarded by most? Maybe I just don't get cinema and film (or maybe it's just because I watched the theatrical cut).",3,cinema-paradiso

Will the back tires get caught in broken beams? etc.) The dialogue in this adds little to the lifeless goings-on in this.The trucks laden with explosives have painted on their sides: NO SMOKING within 50 feet ...yet in both truck cabs the drivers regularly smoke and later while an oil well is burning several hundred yards from one truck a firefighter hands a cigarette to a driver.and finally, the location setting for this movie has to be guessed at....as some folks speak Spanish and others French (with a bit of English tossed in).

I did not engage with these characters once and since the entire film is about their relationship and how as Anne deteriorates physically, Georges seems to lose it mentally, that is a massive problem; we are essentially trapped in a Paris apartment with the two of them, so becoming wrapped up in their world was key and I never did. The characters felt so flat and the acting almost felt like it was from some cheap local theatre production.I thought I was in for some more great Haneke work with the opening sequences (I loved how the piano concerto was framed) but aside from a few interesting shots here and there, there was little else in the way of production that stood out.

75917,"In Charlotte Wells’ remarkably daring feature debut Aftersun, a woman recollects her childhood vacation she had with her father. Throughout the film it seems as if we’ve seen this story of idyllic vacation of a young father and his daughter many times, but Wells ingeniously maps their journey towards an unexplainable mystery. It’s a memory piece about blossoming into maturity but more importantly, a vessel for one’s mourning and healing.To note that the film is taken from Wells’ own childhood, makes the experience more shattering and personal. Aftersun takes its journey step by step, calmly and unassuming until it reveals the core of why Wells wants to tell her story. There’s not much dramatic context to fully address everything that happened before and after the vacation, but all the important details of this relationship are laid. Aftersun isn’t interested in a clear storyline of melodrama, but its structure is attuned to mood and perceptions. After all, it’s a memory piece of someone trying to make sense and understand another person regardless of how complete or incomplete that vision is.A pair of devastating, beautiful performances from Paul Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio anchors the movie. Both actors carry this rich, emotional feeling towards each other that makes every moment intimate and palpable. Their performances feel so natural, you’d think they’re not doing anything at all. But it’s all in their tiny details, the body language that supports the complexity of their character’s relationship.Overall, Aftersun is a shattering and emotionally complex work. How do we really figure out someone, especially when it’s our own parents?. By the end of our lives, do we really know them at all? In this, Wells uses cinema as her lens to fully understand herself and her father. That for me, is beautiful and inspirational.",7,aftersun
87133,"Of COURSE an art film about the desire to escape from reality would be a slam dunk with the Letterboxd crowd! And a Japanese one from the Neon Genesis Evangelion guy, to boot? It's almost a cheat code at that point! Unfortunately, with Ritual, Hideaki Anno's efforts to connect on a viscerally emotional level mostly flatlined in my case, where his exuberant visual eye couldn't be matched by a narrative worthy of it.There's no denying that Anno expresses cutting levels of empathy for his fractured characters, and the same mind behind Shinji's season-long emotional journey was all for translating that core into a live-action setting. The dynamic wide shots and sweeping camera movements truly carry most of the weight in Ritual, as does Ayako Fujitani's hyper-fragmented performance. These elements help Anno create a noticeably strong sense of subjectivity in this nameless character's inner struggle, which is enough to elevate Ritual to a passing grade, but it's not enough to make everything else around it more tolerable.For starters, as a fairly essential co-lead, Shunji Iwai is a rather bland presence, whose artsy voiceovers give off an air of profundity, but ultimately go in one ear and out the other in record time. More than anything, though, the level of repetition, while truly befitting a film titled Ritual, became so numbing after a rather short while that I began feeling less and less guilt as my finger gradually hovered the mouse closer and closer to the ""x2 speed"" button with each passing minute. Then there's the finale, which wraps up such a deeply spiralling character conflict far too quickly and cleanly given the layered portrayal of mental illness that Anno was presenting up until those final moments. Ultimately, like most of the scant less-than-rave reviews for Ritual, I find myself admitting that maybe this was just an off-day, and a revisit in the future would yield more fruitful results. As it stands though, Ritual's rote sense of theatrical arthouse idiosyncrasy wore out its welcome around the halfway point. From then on, the film left me with the occasional A Woman Under the Influence Vietnam flashback, which is to say that—in what is undeniably a thermonuclear take—Hideaki Anno, like John Cassavetes, has presented me with an exercise in empathy that ran far more like a gruelling exercise in patience.",5,ritual-2000

14409,"It's immediately apparent that Paul Schrader was aiming for more than just a conventional biographical drama with his directorial and dreamy study of Yukio Mishima, one of the most significant Japanese authors of the past one hundred years. Structured around the last day of Mishima’s life, it provides a compelling theatrical portrayal through dramatised portions of a selection of his books.It's a prominent and bold universe that's constructed by the brashly coloured set designs of Eiko Ishioka, with each of the four chapters having its own varied and distinct colour palette. Mishima’s intense fantasies are frequently converging with the validities of the real world, and there's unquestionably a salacious romanticism towards dying young, preferably, as stated during the film, before the age of forty.Philip Glass' supplies a glorious music score that's full of kinetic energy as the reflections provide an assortment of hypnotic introspections together with the liberal employment of flashback sequences. Paul and Leonard Schrader’s screenplay has seemingly selected works that exhibit Mishima with more than a trace of narcissism, and he's often beheld treating the actualities of life as nothing more than a melodramatic preamble towards death. The counselled intricacies and ambivalences of Mishima emerge with considerable delicateness, and the engaging snapshots paint a complex and problematic figure who supervised a private army and incontrovertibly lived and died for their art.",9,mishima-a-life-in-four-chapters

I can appreciate a sad film but the end section really turned me off. It went from a bittersweet film about chosen family to melodramatic misery porn real quick.The adult characters that you spent 90 minutes rooting for all became less likable and the story doesn’t end well for anyone. The little girl has a life of misery ahead, as do the rest of them most likely. Random thoughts:Miyu Sasaki is the cutest child actor ever. Sakura Ando (Nobuyo) was my favorite and she delivered a knockout performance. If you want to see peak Asian cinema, watch Linda Linda Linda and spare yourself this empty feeling.",4,shoplifters
69591,"Sci-Fi Film Challenge - The Road to my Top 10“If you see something besides me and Sartorius try not to lose your head.”Well this did not go the way I expected. I had just heard from a friend that Solaris, co-written and directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, was painfully boring. Now, no one bores more easily than me, so I was bracing myself, but well, for the most part I wasn’t. While I take issue with the first 45 minutes of this film, as a whole I find this enigmatic and therefore fascinating.First, the elephant in the room, the time spent on Earth. Smarter people than I can probably explain the purpose of it but it feels like way too long of a set up. I like the opening because it bookends the film which is something I love to see but from there we get long, drawn out dialogue about what Berton (Vladislav Dvorzhetskiy) saw in the Solaris ocean. Even more so is the scenes featuring Kris’s (Donatas Banionis) family. This takes up a lot more time than necessary and combined with experimental filmmaking (an elongated sequence of exterior and interior shots of a car driving for example), Solaris, becomes a project that feels edited by a student in film school.Someone told me Solaris is a great film that isn’t for modern audiences and I think that’s the right way to put it. For many, this film would be turned off prior to that 45-minute mark and that would be a shame because once we get to the space station, things get interesting. The science fiction in this film is top tier. What the water on Solaris manifests and how it does it is excellent conceptually. I also like that this isn’t a case of a character’s sanity being questioned by their shipmates. It’s a fresh take amongst many films. This manifestation exists amongst them all.I also like how quiet Solaris is. It’s a meditative film with philosophy I’ll need to read about because it’s way over my head but I also like how impactful the sound is when it is used. There’s the whooshing that exaggerates the silence and Eduard Artemyev’s score which is sparingly used but great.I loved, loved, loved the ending. Also, Kris and his rocket launcher is a low-key hilarious moment.I can’t believe I liked this. May 2024 First-Time Watches Ranked (18 out of 30 to date)",6,solaris

49336,"Okay y'all need to fucking stop with this shit. Why the fuck is every Asian American movie about generational trauma and a tiger mom who doesn't know how to accept their children? Incredible how this is basically Turning Red in that its central conflict stems from the tiger mom not being able to accept her daughter for who she is and its resolution is found in the acceptance between them. But instead of turning into a red panda they travel between multiverses. From Turning Red to Umma, Kims Convenience, and Fresh Off the Boat, I'm so fucking tired of these dumbass depictions of Asian American parents. Not to mention the so called nuance in these works that their filmmakers are touting doesn't mean shit when they don't even come close to transcending the stereotypes they grounds themselves in. Starting to think that Asian Americans have been so far removed from their own culture and nuanced conversations about their identity that it is literally impossible for them to see themselves outside of a set of stereotypes defined by the west. I find this to be so tragic. But it would absolutely be a mistake to think that these types of Asian American stories are the ones that are naturally being highlighted right now. You guys really think it's by mistake or natural occurrence that American capital is specifically funding these types of Asian American films/projects? I need all the talented and upcoming Asian American filmmaker homies to please listen to me when I say this is not the way and that we are capable and deserving of so much more. p.s. Please stop with the shit where you assert an Asianness through food shots. Shit's so fucking lazy and cliché and I'm begging you to please do anything but that? Or have it be more meaningful.I was at a QnA event with the Daniels where Daniel Kwan did most of the talking. From the sounds of it, when he said things like ""trying to capture the nuances of Asian family"", ""trying to highlight the potentials of our Asian cast"", ""I've seen Asian mother and daughter dynamics done in other movies"", I got the sense that he has zero idea how trite these tropes and stereotypes are.

84192,"(UPDATE: please consult this review I just did for Jurassic Park for further Oppenheimer thoughts 🙃)A hilarious blunder, but one I’m grateful for - as I watched my theatreful of fellow Oppygoers stumble out of the room after our shared three-hour sit, they were all either yawning or smiling the inside-joke smile of people looking at each other, realizing they all just watched something bad and boring. There wasn’t a satisfied eye in the house. And I thought to myself, “some of these Film Bros may actually stop drinking the kool-aid about this man, finally.”I hate to position myself to give Aaron Sorkin a compliment, but Christopher Nolan is no Aaron Sorkin, and has no feel whatsoever for the pacing and the interiority of a courtroom drama, which is what so many Film Bros around the globe will soon be sad to learn Oppenheimer is. Those who came to my screening under the influence, stuffing their faces with snacks, ready to take in spectacle and “visual poetry” (whatever that is) were rewarded with only two or so minutes of it, half of which - including the big interrogation climax - had cheap white lighting with the technical gravitas of a Buffy episode (Sorry to diss Buffy like this - I wanna state for the record that I like even the worst Buffy episodes more than I like this movie).Matt Damon occasionally lit up the screen with some humor and pep, but otherwise these were dead-in-the-water performances, including Cillian Murphy’s (at best, if you press me to be more fair and unbiased, he was fine). About a third of the way into this movie - after a dozen great and vital character actors had been introduced with little or no flair - the camera leaned in excitedly to give a superstar welcome to a Safdie brother, giving a uniformly bad performance with a cartoonish accent. That’s the kind of movie Oppenheimer is.Worst of all, our beloved Florence Pugh was tasked with showing her tits so excessively and tastelessly…all in “service” to a performance for which she won’t even get an oscar nomination. Destroyer of something, here’s hoping.",0,oppenheimer-2023

49527,"Delirious, unconventional and glorifying a worldview that's utter garbage, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the logical next step creation of a culture that continues its unabated slide towards ignorance. But don't take my word for it; here are directors Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert being super explicit about the whole thing:So with this movie, we were like let’s see how many people we can bring into the fold. Without compromising anything, how many people can we bring into our strange, philosophical point of view? Which is basically that nothing matters, and that’s a beautiful thing? And that's the picture's most noticeable flaw; every delight that's found here, every take of originality and cinematic bravado, plays second fiddle to its nauseating proselytizing. The Daniels understand that people don't go to church anymore, but they sure do love going to the movies. So why not preach when the lights go out?How are our myths going to be able to keep up with that, how do we create unifying myths in a post-community world? Everyone and everything is being pulled away from each other. Everything is falling apart. Nothing is holding together. And if we’re going to talk about intent, this movie was in some ways our attempt to answer that question.The movie functions primarily as a guru, showering audiences with ""the right way to live"", and ""what life is really about"". Except all of these ""revelations"" are not new at all. The film posits that since nothing matters, the best way to make sense of life is to love ourselves, our family and neighbors. Love is the key that unlocks the mysteries of the cosmos and makes us feel alive. Indeed it is, but why do I get the impression that nobody has even heard of John 3:16?we have built walls in with all of the organization, all the labeling, and all the boxes that we’re putting everything in. And it’s actually going to be to our benefit to break free from that.

62397,"Enter the labyrinth of power, where the subaltern condition meets the subaltern authority.On the surface is Vienna, the literal mazes of bombed-out stone and plaster forming the basis for expressions of authority and exchanges of capital. It's a city scarred by war, split apart by foreign nationalities, caught in limbo between its former glory and its grim present. Shadows cast long as eyes peer from every window, every door, every street, every corner, every being in this city indebted to another and complicit in the exchanges needed to make an interstitial existence such as this functional. A literal underground labyrinth lays bare just how weak the controlling parties really are in this world; there is always a subaltern presence, but the one from below is the one to watch out for.Power exists at every level, expressed by every member of a society. Military authority might supersede that of the citizens in theory, but in practice it is all superficial. No authority can outnumber those they control, nor can they outmaneuver the intimate networks of authority that empower the disempowered, those who must look beyond leadership in order to survive. Black market exchanges and transnational bonds unite the Viennese, even as it poses a danger to them. Yet when the world has become nothing but rubble, who can fault them for drawing power from within?One question exists at the root of this mystery, a root which branches into countless directions as the nature of this transitory world from which authority is both expressed and cultivated unfolds before our eyes: Who killed Harry Lime? Why did he die? Who was Harry Lime, the expatriot, the grifter, the charmer, the friend? How did he pass and who did he anger? What was his power, his ability to exploit the networks of transactions that enable this shell of a city to persist? Noir protagonists are unique in their ability to navigate these networks of power. The private eye, the modern cowboy, the new Übermensch; these ""heroes"" are bound to their own morality, outside of society, engaging quests of knowledge to resolve (or exploit) the imbalances of power in the world as they see fit. It is a fine line they walk, not quite good and not quite evil; in being unbound from the moral demands of their world, however, they are given a power and agency that makes this niche of fiction absolutely vital.Is Holly Martins able to wear that hat? Is he able to exploit the relationships of power as Harry did, to find the answers he is seeking, to find the truth that lies at the heart of Vienna. Does he have the power to supersede moral authority, to bend transactional agency to his will, to find just who the third man really is?The Third Man poses these questions through tone and through visuals, constructing one of the most dramatically potent spaces in all of film and populating it with some of the most emotive agents to navigate this world. Even if the only connection one has with this film is on a superficial level, the film still offers some of the most genuinely thrilling, suspenseful and knotty sequences and storytelling moments I've ever witnessed. It falters only in some of the early moments of pacing, but when it gets going it never stops.It all but demands your full attention and commitment to the material, subsuming you into the exchanges of power that define this world and posing the same moral challenges that have divorced this Vienna from any prior conception of innocence. It feels like the perfect moral center of the entire conception of film noir, of a world rendered in stark black and white whose moral core couldn't be any more ambiguously grey. Once you enter the maze of power, there is no escape. You can only dive deeper in, further in further, giving yourself fully to the systems at play. Whether you're a peasant or a captain or a cowboy or a killer, you'll never be able to avoid the demands of this world. All you can do is try to twist it to your advantage, and pray you don't become dust and rubble yourself.",8,the-third-man
45376,"Myspace Film Challenge Recommended by WafflezandFilm #47 that was recommended to me -- feel free to add to the list! (Recommended by Cecil Selwyn)As is usual for me these days, hot take alert. Sorry to do this to ya Wafflez, but I suppose we're even now since you didn't like Red Desert, haha.I get it, Werckmeister Harmonies is a gorgeous film. The black and white really pops. It has impressive long takes with seemingly effortless camera movement in which no actor slips for even a moment. In a broad sense I guess I ""get it,"" but I'm 100% certain if I cared to rewatch and dig deeper, there's a lot going on under the surface. The music is nice. Point is, it's not a bad movie. Béla Tarr and Ágnes Hranitzky know how to film a thing. And I need to emphasize that in criticizing films like this, I'm never trying to denigrate fans. Most people come away from this moved by philosophically-rich interpretations and that's entirely valid.But I don't think this is for me. It's weird to say after I've spent so many reviews talking about how much I enjoy slow cinema, and feeling like this style is just a free high score. Yet here, I just don't feel the intention behind the style (again, emphasizing how subjective this is, I am not saying it is an objective truth that there is no meaningful intention). I don't like the word pretentious, so instead, let's go with ""elitist."" This film feels like elitism. Using Tarkovsky as the traditional point of comparison within slow cinema, I fully believe that every time Tarkovsky did anything with his style, there was a reason for it. It always felt poetic, like shots were held to allow space for contemplation and studying the textures of the environments. This movie, on the other hand, feels like it is slow because slow is artsy. We linger on people walking for minutes, and I just don't think it's worth the time spent. I imagine the goal must be contemplation again, though I felt I had nothing worth contemplating in most of these times. Conversations are vague and cryptic in ways that feel forced, with the whole movie seeming like an exercise in abstract connections between concepts like harmonic principles, political unrest, and nihilism. An intellectual exercise for sure, and maybe one I'm now admitting I'm not smart enough for... but one that feels offputtingly elitist and alienating.This feeling is driven by my belief that the film stays slow when it doesn't have to, and in fact absolutely should not. As the townspeople grow increasingly out of control and dangerous, they stand almost motionless, like zombies. The fires they're standing around just grow in size. Even the moment they finally attack and violence erupts (in an otherwise well-orchestrated scene), it's lacking passion and energy. The scene felt so off for me until I realized the problem: the victims being beaten are not allowed to make a sound. It's all so sleepy and lethargic. To bring up Tarkovsky one more time, the man who is notorious for slow quiet movies did something like this in Andrei Rublev. There is a violent raid in that film, and when it happens, it's full of tension and excitement and horror. He knew when to cater the style to the events. The refusal of Werckmeister Harmonies to ever shift its approach at a time like that makes me think it is being an ""art film"" in the worst way, and as soon as that feeling hits, I don't have the patience for it. But I can't deny for a moment that it's well-made in what it is doing, so 2.5 feels fair.",4,werckmeister-harmonies
15679,"Cold, distant visuals. Unnecessary and illogical mystery hanging by a thread as a plot device. Actors blocked, and instructed to act, like robots. Grating, snarky, awful dialogue. Our protagonists are handed letters to track down people to unlock a mystery behind their mother's death, but why wouldn't they just open the letters or what if they didn't find who they were looking for? It is so artifical and strained, and makes everyone interact with our characters in the most forced way possible. And leaves no space to connect with anyone in the film. I have no idea who anyone is or whatever the hell they do. Characters get introduced and dissapear just like that.Villenueve constantly undermines the gravity and power of the story with his dedication to melodramatic visual nonsense. Incendies is exactly what a disconnected artsy hipster thinks about war, and more importantly, how he thinks depicting it should look like. A maudlin, over-choreographed framing of a fresh massacre, inappropriate needle drops after exploitative depictions of human sadism, and a ridicolously threatrical plot device on top of a story that demands caution and respect.That ""one and one is two"" scene is a borderline parody of this cringy, corny, hipster affectation Villenueve thinks is profound. I laughed when I should've been horrified.Who the hell thought Villenueve can handle torture, rape, and child murder? Cause his way of doing it is just to capture it coldly and hold the shots on its victims. As if that brutal literalism is supposed to evoke empathy or makes the film more honest than what it really does which is showcase that Villenuve has no artistic ability to weave these themes and images and drain them of their exploitative aspect while highlighting their emotional resonance.  This fact is most glaringly made towards the end when a certain character receives a shocking revelation and Villenueve doesn't even hold the camera on their face longer than 5 seconds, and cuts away abruptly. I became so angry that I didn't finish the movie for like 2 days, with only a couple of minutes left. Villenuve doesn't even let the actor change his facial expression in those 5 seconds. That's an emotional coldness and such an inhuman incuriosity in finding answers in human emotions and psychology that astound to me such a degree that I actually don't like Villenueve as a person, let alone a director. I cannot for the life of me understand how this is so highly rated and praised, this is so exploitative, arid and is written like a pornographic film. Sterile in its delivery, in its point of view, and in its atittude. A film that supposedly exposes the coldness of the human soul, and only succeeds in exposing its own.To say something is pretentious is to illicitly admit it captured some real emotions or ideas. This fails to even do that. There's zero things to be gleaned from Incendies. A film about war, religion, politics, and family that manages to say nothing about them, besides shitting on them by being so in love with itself as a film, and with torturing the characters and the viewers for no reason other than to exploit our emotions with no thematic or substanstive payoff. A modern day Last House on the Left with a prestige veneer.A genuine garbage of a film.",1,incendies

11718,"I was told about how my Great-Grandmother was murdered in Vietnam when I was very young. She was killed by American soldiers riding in a helicopter one afternoon when she was tending to her garden — as my young Bà Nội watched her own mother perish while she was hiding underneath the floorboards of her house. These nightmarish images seared in my mind made the ""iconic"" Ride of the Valkyries sequence all the more unnerving.I have yet to watch an American produced film about the conflict in Vietnam where the Vietnamese people were not depicted as unsophisticated savages or a dead body. In this film, a woman was gunned down for a puppy, a man was stripped naked and hung, and a school filled with children was bombed. None of them were given perspective or dialogue.I'm not saying these atrocities didn't happen or that this wasn't depicted intentionally by the filmmakers as a commentary on the futility of war — what I'm saying is that's not all that happened (especially from the Vietnamese POV) and by neglecting the humanity of these people, we are reductively relegating their existence to a crying, screaming, and dying... body.I can recognize the auteur's artistic audacity and the technical brilliance it took to pull off a work of this scale. But we have to pull back to look at the macro picture, beyond the attractive superficial design, and confront the meaning of these images and why they continue to circulate in American hearts and minds as the definitive image of Vietnam. As the author of The Sympathizer, Viet Thanh Nguyen, deftly puts it: ""Apocalypse Now is an important work of art, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to bow down before it.

5469,"While watching La Haine (1995), it doesn't take long for even the least attentive filmgoers to recognize director Kassovitz's dependence on suffusing the entire narrative with pop-culture and meta-cinematic references. As a film about the mercurial nature of racial and cultural anxieties among disenfranchised youths, such narrative devices may be necessary, as the three lead characters - estranged from their ancestry and marginalized from society - borrow from cultures outside of their own to create a sense of identity. The manner at which they form their identities also signifies a rebellious spirit to some degree. Generally speaking, pop-culture and its references may serve as hugely powerful and creative forces due to their ubiquitous presence, so it shouldn't come as a surprise when multicultural and youthful anarchism has made a broader impact on pop-culture itself. Naturally, this particular relation between anarchy and pop-culture is bidirectional - one serves to amplify the other. Of course, an overreliance on referential storytelling is at the risk of jeopardizing creative acuity with uninspired imagery. It's disappointing that the film has the necessary ingredients to supply its dramatic ardor with a specific kind of sociopolitical discourse rarely found in cinema but instead trades on a facile exploration of what amounts to fashionable politics. Indeed, not many films have made thematic connections between the volatility of multiculturalism - along with the irrational hatred spawning from such tensions - and the youth identity crisis regarding the appropriation of pop-cultural symbols as a gesture of resistance. From a historical perspective, pop-culture has always existed in an area of tension between globalized production and local adaptation, an interconnection of commerciality with art. This interconnection can assist in delivering powerful statements that not only confirm the youth resistance but also substantiate their devotion to cultural homogeneity, to maintain this sense of belonging among the marginalized. In a way, adopting these pop-cultural symbols is an act of protest, one that can, potentially, reach the global scale of pop-culture commercialism, or at the very least, feel as if it carries such power. Unfortunately, pop-culture references in La Haine appear to be purely stylistic features with little to no thematic potency. Even though the film neglects any further engagement with such material, it's an intermittently exciting and formally impressive pastiche at best, but a superficially stylized and shallow drama at worst. It's an entertaining yet ultimately unchallenging reproduction of pop-culture iconography.",3,la-haine
55147,"It's incredible what some people will do to feel powerful. Watching Marcello avoid being a real human being, making real connections, or doing anything of real value, just to bang anything that moves and never ever stop avoiding reality, is a lesson in how exhausting it is being a fuckboy. You never sleep. You chase people all day and all night. You get slapped around by other fuckboys. You lie to those closest to you. You lose real love. You lose real life.

30561,"Red Beard (1965), directed by Akira Kurosawa is a story about a young, privileged doctor and his new mentor. Noboru (Yuzo Kayama) arrives at a local hospital thinking he is only there for a brief visit, however, unbeknownst to him he is ordered to work permanently, replacing a previous employee. Before his departure, the man informs him it will be far from easy, and that the chief physician, Dr Kyojo “Red Beard” Niide” (Toshiro Mifune), is a real hard case. Impoverished patients crowd the waiting room, staff are constantly running too and fro, and all Noboru can think of is how he shouldn’t be there, but be in his comfy position elsewhere. The film is laden with themes of social injustice, class struggle, and humanitarianism. The film also has a number of digressions with secondary characters recounting significant moments in their lives. Kurosawa has made many humanitarian films, but this is one that solely focuses on the inequalities of old Japan. As always, Mifune delivers a commanding and convincing performance. Yuzo Kayama is also very good. The story feels dedicated to the most vulnerable in society and once again cements Kurosawa as a truely empathetic person. A few things prevent it from being a masterpiece. Sometimes the emotions can feel a little forced, leaning too much into melodrama. As it stands, it’s too long perhaps, with its many deviations, so perhaps it would’ve been better as a tv series. This film is also the end of an era for Mifune and Kurosawa. After collaborating sixteen times, this would be their last time working together. Whilst it’s not necessarily their best, it’s a fitting conclusion to one of the best partnerships in cinema.",6,red-beard

33685,"So yesterday I watched Ryan O'Neal in The Driver as the nameless, unflustered, laconic man behind the wheel and it was a pretty iconic role that would be tough to top. Yet here we are today and he's playing a sneaky yet lovable conman alongside his real life daughter in a film that has nothing in common with The Driver at all (apart from the fact that both films contain a lot of, well, driving.) Paper Moon is no doubt the superior film and performance from O'Neal in my mind - a bittersweet, seriously fun ride through the great depression alongside two characters who often argue but are secretly having the time of their lives. Bogdanovich has never been a director that evokes starling awe from his camerawork but he's extremely adept at putting great stories on screen. His ability to capture the viewers emotions, grab them by the neck and drag them along for the ride hit serious heights with The Last Picture Show but was probably perfected right here. The two leads are superb and anytime they're on screen the film is perfect. Whenever they're apart, it loses a little steam (e.g. the scenes with Trixie) and just reinforces the fact that this is the O'Neal's film and the natural connection between the two is palpable. What a heart-grabbing rush it must be for both of them to have practically a time capsule together on screen that'll last their lifetimes and fifty more. Who needs anything else when you've got this? I certainly don't and will no doubt continue coming back to see if Addie finally gets her $200 time and time again.",8,paper-moon

72727,"Roeg’s There Will Be Blood, Yukon-style, is 20 minutes of magical pure cinema followed by almost two hours of the most unbelievable tedium.The warning signs are there even at the beginning: the close-ups of sweating gold, the deep prints in vast snow, the zoom towards the Moon, all set to Stanley Myers’ superb minimalist score, and building to the moment of revelation, but in the middle of it is that fucking awful scene in the house, filled with the most appallingly pretentious dialogue.Soon that’s pretty much the whole movie: a shapeless, incoherent mess, without a single well-drawn character, and its few interesting ideas thoroughly buried beneath the rest. It remains, even then, visually astounding, on the rare occasions it can be bothered: explosions of beauty, astonising match-cuts. But it is, for the most part, just indescribably boring: a promising story that died in the writing room, hopelessly fragmented, with no reason to exist.

43564,"Part of my 5 Directors x 5 Unseen Films (10) challenge. I never read Leo Tolstoy's 1869 literary classic, and I was only five years old when director King Vidor's epic cinematic version was released. What's more, I'm a bit of a neophyte when it comes to Napoleonic history, so most of this story was pleasantly new to me.The film opens in Moscow circa 1800. Russian troops are preparing to march to Austria to fight the French army of Bonaparte (Herbert Lom) and stop his spread across Europe. While most young men are eager to enlist and get into the fray, the intellectual Pierre Bezukhov (Henry Fonda) feels conflicted. As the illegitimate son of a dying count, Pierre questions his place in the world, unlike his close friend Prince Andrei Bolkonsky (Mel Ferrer), who seems to make choices with ease and confidence.Andrei's wife Lise Bolkonskaya (Milly Vitale) is pregnant when he goes off to war as an aide under the command of Field Marshal Mikhail Kutuzov (Oskar Homolka). Although Andrei is heroically injured and captured in battle, he returns safely after an armistice is signed, only to witness his wife die in childbirth, bearing him a son.Another soldier who returns safely to Moscow from the conflict is Nicholas Rostov (Jeremy Brett). He's the son of Pierre's good friend Prince Mikhail 'Ilya' Andreevich Rostov (Barry Jones) and brother to the lovely young Natasha Rostova (Audrey Hepburn). Nicholas is loved by Natasha's best friend and cousin, Sofia 'Sonya' Rostova (May Britt), and Natasha is in turn of interest to Nicholas's best friend and fellow officer Vaska Denisov (Patrick Crean).Before dying, Pierre's father writes to the Russian Czar requesting that his bastard son be recognized as his legal heir. Pierre thus becomes a count and decides for purely practical reasons to marry his own cousin, the beautiful but haughty Hélène Kuragina (Anita Eckberg). The loveless union results in an unhappy marriage, with Hélène seeing the debonair Captain Fyodor Dolokhov (Helmut Dantine) on the side. This leads to a duel with pistols when Dolovov insults Pierre at a dinner party one evening.So at one full hour into this 208-minute extravaganza, we finally have most of the primary characters sorted out. Up to this point, I was most impressed with the costumes, especially all the fancy military uniforms, and less so the story, cinematography and acting. And there's been far too much Peace and not nearly enough War.The second act moves forward to around 1807 and has Andrei meeting and falling in love with Natasha. Vidor uses internal dialog to allow us to monitor their thoughts, an odd device which I understand was also employed in the novel. But Andrei's stodgy father, Prince Bolkonsky (Wilifrid Lawson), insists that the pair wait a year before tying the knot. That gives Hélène time to introduce Natasha to her brother Anatole Kuragin (Vittorio Gassman), and he has his own ideas about whom she should be in love with.Natasha falls for the new suitor and pushes Andrei away, becoming an emotional wreck in the process. It takes interference from Pierre to help her sort things out by revealing the sordid truth about Anatole and his womanizing ways. And in doing so, Pierre learns how much he himself cares for her. As they say about relationships nowadays, it's complicated. Fortunately, the Peace is about come to an end. Naploeon decides to break the truce and have his forces cross the Niemen River into Russia. The invasion is on, and Vidor's crew gets to stage one of cinema's biggest and baddest battle scenes ever -- the Battle of Borodino -- in VistaVision with horses, cannons, muskets. swords, lances and flags flying everywhere, employing an estimated 18,000 extras. Pierre is witness to the carnage, where Andrei is gravely wounded. The defeat of the Russian army is followed by another great piece of cinematography -- the evacuation and abandonment of Moscow. Napoleon marches into the capital and he is so upset that there's nobody around to surrender, that he sets everything on fire.With winter approaching and supplies low, the French have no choice but to begin the long journey back to Paris, with Russian Cossacks nipping at their heels all the way. There's a final and decisive battle at the Berezina River near Borisov, Belarus, which ends the occupation. Those who lived through the war return to Moscow to rebuild their lives and honor those who did not survive.Among the three Academy Awards for which this was nominated were Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design. The Italian-language version won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film, while Hepburn was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress. The picture was also a box office success, ranking 4th highest in gross receipts for the year with $12.5 million in revenues against a budget of $6 million.",6,war-and-peace

26309,"There's a famous trick called ""the grandmother test"" amongst PhD students, which essentially means, if you cannot explain your PhD research topic succinctly within 30 seconds in a way that your grandmother would understand, then you don't understand it well enough. Béla Tarr would 100% fail at that.I get it, art is not a PhD project, not everything needs to have a purpose. Long takes are sometimes not necessary, but they add depth to the film. Hell, Before Sunset is one of my favourite films and I recently loved Boiling Point, filmed entirely in one take. I'd always watch the four hour version of Dances with Wolves over the theatrical cut, because it adds so much to it. This doesn't apply to Sátántangó. We see takes that are several minutes long of cows in a field, of curtains being still, of people sitting down. I have not read the novel, nor do I intend to after sitting through this beast of a movie (is it even a movie? or is it an experimental project? or a sociological experiment to see who manages to sit through it all?), but I struggle to understand how these long takes where absolutely nothing happens can come from the novel. So my assumption is that this is Tarr's useless addition to the story.The thing is, you want to make a seven hour long film in this style? Fine, it's your choice. But how did we get to the stage where this thing is praised and held on a pedestal by critics and cinephiles all around the world? Just because something has never been done before, it doesn't mean it is praiseworthy or innovative or beautiful. For films like this, I often give the example of John and Yoko's first experimental album, which features a track called Two Minutes Silence, which, you guessed it, is just two minutes of silence in the middle of an album with tracks called Baby's Heartbeat, which, you guessed it, is just a baby's heartbeat for five minutes. I strongly disagree with people that say anything can be art. Art has to mean something, or to make you feel something. The long takes in this film feel like Two Minutes Silence and Baby's Heartbeat. They add absolutely nothing to the final project, they only add frustration for the brave viewer who chose to watch this. Whenever I felt like the film was gaining my interest, it immediately lost it by inserting another random long take. It's not art, it's self-sabotage of your own art.Special mention for the cat torture scene. Did that really need to be incorporated into the film and did it really need to go on for so long? What is the point of that? Are you hoping to induce a strong negative emotional reaction in the viewer in the hope that they never forget your film? Because trust me, you did not need to add that scene for that to happen, the rest of the film takes care of inducing a strong negative reaction in me pretty damn well. Not an emotional one though, because I felt absolutely nothing throughout this entire thing. I read on Wikipedia that apparently a veterinarian was on set the whole time and that they did not kill the cat, but regardless, the torture scenes are pretty much real, and a young girl was asked to participate in this abhorrent behaviour for the sake of """"""art"""""". Call me a moralist, but that is just vile and inexcusable to me, and it takes away any merits this film could have had (very few).There's probably a great 2 hour long film buried in here, but it's buried too deep down. I am highly sceptical of anyone who claims to enjoy this - either you mean it and you need your brain examined, or you're only saying it to look like a cultured cinephile. In the latter case, trust me, drop the act, you just look like a pretentious asshole.",0,satantango
41469,"Film #1 of Project 40”I don't want to be an emperor.”I’m trying to be cautious here as I know that my opinion may change later when I re-watch this but I have to say that Charlie Chaplin’s well-known and popular political satire looked lifeless, lazy and incoherent to me. This certainly lacked the kind of warmth that I normally expect to see from Chaplin and while its tonal difference is understandable as the film is unlike any other Chaplin movie but the whole film looked so “queer” that I just couldn't connect it with Chaplin that I had in my mind and that created some sort of a paradox which was bothering me throughout the whole movie. Instead of the happy-go-lucky and goodhearted Tramp and his unique and distinct physical comedy which made likes of Modern Times and City Lights such joyous and sweet experiences here we have something which is more like a movie featuring Marx Brothers. Another problem is that the film looks rather fragmented, while the part focusing on Great Dictator himself looks more interesting but the part focusing on the barber/soldier (who is more similar to the legendary Tramp) was rather boring and if you forgive me for saying so it was totally unnecessary given the satirical and political potential of the other part. And the only thing I dare to say about the ending is that it was too mawkish and totally in contradiction with the tone of the rest of the movie. Or may it’s all because I watched this right after Shoah which made it impossible for me to find anything funny in the story of dictators whose madness is destroying the world.

On the other hand, there's a definite charm to it -- as low-budget as it is, it gives us likable heroes and damnable villains, all wrapped up in a thin veil of who-cares-how-dumb-it-is sci-fi. Well, I suppose I shouldn't veer from my usual rating system -- starts are for cinematographic quality, not kitschy enjoyability. At any rate, the lead is rather improbably good. I just looked up his name: Robert Glaudini. He's sort of wispy and mildly unattractive, but has a certain pathos about him that really works. Demi Moore, in her second movie, is really, really awful. Like, one step above a talking mannequin. I assume from some of the camerawork that this came out in 3-D, and I'm surprised that I didn't see it when it came out. I loved me a bad early 3-D movie!

He is a destructive force in these children's lives, a Pied Piper leading children away.  Yes, having passion for things and trying to find something that you're passionate about is a good thing.  But at the exclusion of everything else?  A passion that allows you to ignore everyone else around you, ignore any sort of responsibilities, and force yourself on anyone & into anyone's life because you've got to seize the day?  Yes, fuck up everyone else's life because you're drunk and you want to kiss this girl without her permission.  Let's disrupt everyone else's schoolwork because you think women are objects for your use and you want them in your school.Keating isn't setting his students up for success with this passion thing.  He's set them up to be reality show contestants on the chopping block.  These competition failures always plead their case by how much passion they have but if you don't have the skills or sense or knowledge, what does it matter?  The movie wants you to ""Go for it!"" but it never wants you to ask what comes after the first step.  It's just like Keating's take on poetry.  Make an emotional connection with the poem (or any work of art) but never ever examine what any of it means, what the author intended, or how the structure of the work leads to why it is good.  No, no, no.  None of that stuff is useful.  Subtext is for cowards, after all.  Knowledge is meaningless if you're passionate about something.  It's simply encouraging a fandom mindset.  Don't try to understand why something emotionally connects with you, just feel it and ignore what a work of art can say about the human condition and how we live our lives.  Just be passionate about it!I called this Fight Club for theater kids but at least Fight Club has that whole mass misreading of the satire going for it.  Dead Poets Society blares its siren song as loud as it can and says exactly what it means on the surface.  And that's what this movie is.  Surface.  It's the shallowest thing I've ever seen.  Just mutter some poetry in cave out of context and suddenly you're some sort of suave rebel.  If you're a rich white boy with safety nets that won't allow you to fail, you can get away with it.

The section that focuses on Josephine feels completely frivolous and interminable and I still have no idea who the woman with the Napoleon shrine is supposed to be or why she's in the film. There's also a lot of focus on Robespierre and the other leaders of the Revolution that's historically important but feels a bit tangential to Napoleon's story.

14695,"TL,DR: I really hated it and I think that it is a very dangerous and dumb movie.firstly I want to clearly state that this is my personal opinion and analysis of the movie.its very difficult for me to watch and then write a review for this movie, firstly because I'm a proud antifascist, secondly because that the history of my country and my family and my future were and are shaped by the likes of fascists like Mishima.I love cinema and any kind of art because I think that they are essential for the human being, not only as a form of expression but also as a form of shaping our reality thru the conveying of a political and ideological message. That is the simple reason because I couldn't stand the artsy cool & aesthetic depiction of Mishima ideas like they didn't have any effect on the world around him, like he was some kind of innocent tormented artist. He surely was tormented, but he is all but innocent. His story is not ""inspirational"" or ""dramatic"", like some people wrote here on Letterboxd. What we see on the screen it's the glorification of a fascist nutcase, and even if this wasn't the main objective of the filmmakers (and I'm not completely convinced this isn't the case), this is what we end up receiving.It's just not interesting and more importantly not useful for the audience to reduce the character to a misunderstood poet, because his actions and ideology still plague our reality. The fascists here in Italy (and I'm sure it happens elsewhere too) have an holiday just for the guy, they celebrate him and organise rewatches of this movie. I'm going to produce an example of my argument here, it is exaggerated but you will surely get the point.Imagine if A24 produced a movie about Hitler or Mussolini and the movie was like: Yeah but Hitler also was a painter and his paintings were beautiful and he was a misunderstood artist, he hated J3ws but he also was one, oh the struggles of this poor artist!The movie is bad, the music is obvious at best and annoying at worst, the cinematography and the acting are cool, so this is the only reason why this movie isn't an half star.Please, stop celebrating fascists and think when you watch a movie.",2,mishima-a-life-in-four-chapters

It’s a hurting heart, beating hard, hoping for better times, and prepared to pull a trick or two to get them. And admirably, the film keeps the sentimentality at bay, resisting the trap of most buddy movies, keeping things taut, charming and with just the right level of astringency. A lovely film.",7,paper-moon
60877,"A three hour courtroom drama was never going to rocket to the top of my list of favorite films, and on some level ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" is exactly the kind of self-important prestige picture you might be anticipating; but Montgomery Clift is almost unbearably sorrowful in his ten minutes of screentime, and the assertions Stanley Kramer makes are rather bold. We all know the quote about evil prospering when good men do nothing, but this film suggests good men are quite capable of that evil themselves, and the world may turn a blind eye to their crimes when it is politically expedient.",7,judgment-at-nuremberg
26398,"I did it. I actually did it. I completed Satantango! 7 hours and 30 minutes of my life were spent on this film and it is now officially the longest film I've ever seen. That title was previously held by Once Upon a Time in America with a runtime of 3 hours and 49 minutes.Yesterday, I saw an instagram post about a film tournament and the current round was Satantango vs Taxi Driver. I felt it was unfair for me to vote as I hadn't seen the infamous 7 and a half hour film so I decided to watch it that day. I was able to see the first 3 hours before getting a headache from all the screen-time and going to sleep. Today, I picked up where I left off and finished the final 4 hours. I now am seated reflecting on the experience.I would like to start off by saying this has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. I am unable to express in words how beautiful the cinematography was. The long takes, camera movement, and events portrayed were all so gorgeous thanks to Gábor Medvigy and his lovely work as director of photography. The cinematography in this film is on the level of fellow black and white films with stunning cinematography such as Paths of Glory, Andrei Rublev, The Elephant Man, The 400 Blows, La Haine, Raging Bull, and Schindler's List. Dare I say, the cinematography here is even better than some of those films. I truly commend Medvigy for his masterful and absolutely breathtaking work.Moving on from the heavenly visual beauty of the film, the acting and dialogue are incredible and very strong aspects of the film. If you were to ask me why I think this isn't a masterpiece then I would have to say that it's too long (what a surprise!) and the story wasn't engaging enough. There were several points where I just lost interest. For the first hour, I was enthralled by the gorgeous cinematography and fantastic performances but I was very bored from the story and had no care for what was happening. Once the ""cat scenes"" appeared, I was suddenly very interested and from then onwards, my eyes were locked onto the screen. Sadly, around the 5-hour mark, I lost interest again. It kind of went on like that for the rest of the film; lose interest, gain interest, lose interest, gain interest. A continuous cycle. Going away from the story and my engagement with it, I now move on to the runtime and as I said, it's too long. There's one part where a man just walks non-stop for like 20 minutes and I believe that could've been cut down but I don't know, there's probably meaning behind it. There's probably a lot of meaning behind each scene but I most likely didn't understand all the spiritual and religious dialogue and scenery with deeper meaning. Maybe I'll pick it up on further rewatches but sadly, I won't be rewatching this anytime soon.I am officially able to tell my friends that I have seen a film which is almost 8 hours long. I think of it as an achievement but I still have longer films in my watchlist to watch like Evolution of a Filipino Family and Tie Xi Qu. Bela Tarr's Satantango is a very intimate and quiet film. It takes its time and it isn't really a film made for audiences but instead a film which Tarr just wanted to make for himself and for those who care. He successfully got his messages and themes out there and the end result was a brilliant film with masterful technical aspects. By the time the credits began to roll, I sat there in amazement. Satantango reminds me a lot of Andrei Tarkovsky's work with the brilliance, deep meanings, and careful execution and precision. I don't really know how to end this review except to say that I think every cinephile should experience this film at least once in their lives.Journey To See Every Film On The LB Top 250Most Beautiful Films Ever",5,satantango
54374,"Angelopoulos has a extremely unique visionary style to him, the more films of his I watch, the more apparent this becomes. However this style sometimes overtakes itself and becomes too confident in its approach. His films are beginning to look like the way Bela Tarr shoots his movies. In fact I think that is the director whom he closely resembles in technique and approach. Which is not such a good thing for me as I am not a Tarr fan. The Weeping Meadow seemed to be more of a showcase for directorial talent than that of a movie. Theo kept his audience away at a distance throughout most of the film and choreographed and set up all of these scenes in this 2 hour plus long film on a grand scale but left the story, the artistry and the emotion on the back burner. The story is epic in scope for the amount of time it covers and it does seem like a great story to be told but it was never executed in the proper way because Theo did not put it first and foremost before anything else in his film. There were many scenes in the film that felt incoherent for the lack of story that was told, we were given certain major events and basically a ""highlight reel"" of what happens but not thoroughly explained in between. The two main positives that I seen in this film were its music and camera placement (although like Tarr, I felt the camera lingered in almost every scene longer than it should have.) I rate it a 7/10 because it is not a bad film but one that is extremely difficult to get into as a viewer and probably will only entertain or emotionally touch those few with its acquired taste.",5,the-weeping-meadow
65711,"Starts off very strong, laying the foundation for a great heist film. An underground-renowned thief gets on parole, meets with a cast of charismatic characters, and begins planning his next detailed and meticulous robbery plot. The build-up to the heist scene established everything perfectly. The characters not only talk about how hard a bank this would be to rip off, but also the film showcases the impeccability of the bank's security system and the cast's failed attempts to thwart it. Up until, of course, they do. And the final larceny! If I were a cartoon character watching this, my eyes would have turned into stars. Not only does it show the satisfying execution of a perfectly planned crime, but it has many moments of tension where things go just slightly off script. My heart kept jumping!And the filmmaking here! There's no dialouge. The characters do not speak for this scene at all. Not only does seeing the characters pull off this theft without even needing to speak with each other show just how meticulously they planned this and how skilled they are, but the uneasy ambiense casts an eerie tension into the air as well. And the camera slides around the whole set! It's not afraid to cut or shift or do anything to get the most out of a shot. To center a character or to frame a background. You really see everything going on at all moments, making you feel like you yourself are there in the room as well. This is helped also by the fact that most of the shots of things happening outside the bank are first shown through the perspective of a person looking out a window of the bank itself. However sadly this is only the first half or so of the film. From here, it quickly escalates on almost no foundation. It changes from a slow-moving thriller to a tense film leaning almost on action. It embraces a scope of 10+ characters, way to many to try to juggle this quickly without compromising some emotional impact. Many come off seeming one-note or jsut simply annoying.And, thought we all know how money corrupts people, this process isn't instentanous. Look at a slower burn, nuanced, believeable film about greed like Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The characters there evolve, betray, love and die. Here, everyone is driven by such simplistic motives it's like they are the villains in a children's show. Though I can't deny the film set's an awesome standard. It's an albeit rough base for all criminal heist films since. Though I believe the formula has been improved on (Baby Driver adds music, National Treasure adds historical references, Ocean's Eleven adds Brad Pitt, etc) it's undeniable that no exact copycat could ever replicate it. Probably up there with Dog Day Afternoon in that sense, one of the most reinventive crime dramas I've ever seen.",5,rififi

72412,"“Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called 'The Pledge'. The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige'.”The Prestige feels like the favorite movie of every 14 year old. This is in no way a diss to anyone who likes the film, all I’m saying is that with the absurd amount of blatant twists plagued in a film where it’s played as a trick with no real mystery at all, it would most definitely sound like the best thing ever to a much younger version of me. Look: the concept of two rival magicians trying to steal each other’s secrets sounds amazing. I love magic, I’ve done a bunch of simple party tricks myself, like: guessing someone’s card, or releasing a coin from my mouth. But the film acts like it's doing this big mysterious and mind-blowing display, when in reality, it's all laid out very obviously and doesn't have as much intrigue as it assesses of itself. The more time passes, the more simple and less thought-out The Prestige looks to be for me. The film itself ironically lacks its own “prestige”. It's hard to even tell what the twist is ""supposed"" to be because it's laid out so evenly. We see him build the cloning machine, so that's not it. I guess the twins is the twist? Either way, the entire premise of making a film feel like a magic trick requires, i don’t know, more secrecy.You see, the concept of magic itself is quite fascinating and probably one of humanity’s most interesting ideas. When you can't explain a trick, like the teleportation trick in the film, the first thing we would always conclude is that it was twins. Caine’s character even says a double is the only logical explanation. But if it wasn't that, it was legitimate magic. The twins twist feels like  the cop-out explanation. I personally don’t think The Prestige necessarily had to “explain” the secret. But then, one would argue that the secret being as simple as twins is the point to emphasize the destruction Hugh Jackman had to put himself through just to one-up Christian Bale. We're given cloning as a way out, but we know it the whole time - It's not a “turn”. The entire film is, in fact, structured according to the three-step process of a magic trick. Using sci-fi in itself feels like a cop-out. The cloning machine serves the ideas of getting your hands dirty and dedication to the work. Yes, that’s factual. But It itself is not a trick, it's just ABOUT a trick. the ""craft"" is undermined by sci-fi because it offers a convenient escape hatch to the audience's feeling of wonderment and curiousity, rather than put in the work to actually subvert their expectations. It's an ""ethical"" cop-out. I think a lot of people agree that magic and movies are very similar. Yet, The Prestige was less like magic than most movies. I mean, when you have a bunch of Wolverine clones running around the facility trying to drown each other, something feels off. That's not what magic feels like. For me, there was a huge disconnect between the content and the form.Let’s use a different scene as an example of comparison: The bird illusion. The film shows us how it’s done, thus giving more depth to the idea of getting your hands dirty for a good trick. Would it have been better if it were revealed that the creator of said trick had to talk to Albert Einstein in order to open a wormhole that secretly takes the bird somewhere else only to pop right back completely unharmed? Would you say it reveals anything that has to do with the ethics of awe? Here’s how I see it: The Prestige sets up intrigue with no real intrigue at all. There's no mystery because of how meticulously it's explained both in terms of plot and theme. I will give it some credit though. The way they showed Jackman trying to figure out Bale's secret further drove home the point that the secret isn't important, but rather how you use your secret. It’s something that people shouldn't give much attention on because Hugh’s character became extremely obsessive and self-destructive. Trying to figure out the secret scarred him so much physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially. He was even told by various other characters in the film that his obsession with with discovering the secret was unhealthy and that he should just let it go. In the end, it was that search that ended him. The thematic narratives are solid, the script’s content, not so much.The Prestige is currently no. 41 on IMDB’s top 250 films of all time. I guess it’s not that much of a stretch to deem it overrated. Listen, when it came to the performances and the cinematography, I have no complaints. Although, I would have wanted someone else play the protagonist other than Jackman because a part of me believes someone else could’ve been better, but that’s besides the point. I just really don’t like the script. Aren't you supposed to mystify the audience in a magic trick? The prestige part is where the magician reveals that it's the same bird, somehow magically returned. But in this movie, it's a different bird. Why does it explain its tricks to us? I thought the sci-fi element was a cop-out. There's no mystery or excitement in that. I'm not opposed to sci-fi. But to undercut practicality with such an unsatisfying interpretation of fantasy, that’s where I’ve completely begun to lose track of the movie's ambition. The intended realism of the film is contradicted by the existence of sci-fi. In addition, the number of twists the ending tried to cram in just felt silly. Roger Ebert said it best: “Now you see me, Now you see me”.On a completely unrelated note: I’m changing my profile picture to Kim Wexler smoking in tribute to only a month of waiting left for Better Call Saul s6 (a.k.a the GREATEST show of all time). I swear to God, if Kim ends up biting the dust, Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will be forcefully obliged to finance my therapy. I’m not even kidding",4,the-prestige

It has one of the most endearing relationships I’ve ever witnessed, the best child performance of all time, and perfect comedic timing.It has the most proficient balance of emotion and humor.

Its comedy never feels insincere, even when it breaks up otherwise poignant moments. Ryan and Tatum O’Neal are beyond words. A dynamic so real it would be unfair to compare them to other actors.

It also depicts the stifling and destructive consequences of a blind obedience to strict social rules. At it's core though it's about resistance, and the importance of it,  to that authority. With excellent performances, beautifully shot, paced and writing this is an absolutely wonderful film. It shows the abusive and exploitative nature of the system and those within it as well as the greed and grasping for power and influence that it encouraged and thrived on. A good corrective to the often romanticised image of the samurai, in this case during the Edo period.   ""At the same time it's a lonely feeling. I wonder what I have done all my life though it's not like me to do so""                                                          Isaburo SasaharaMifune's Sasahara is trapped in a loveless marriage and an unfulfilling role subject to the whims of his superiors and the pressure of his family and clan whose only concerns are social standing and influence. All consequences of a system he's spent decades working within and by his efforts upholding. We watch him grow in confidence and passion as he watches his son and daughter-in-law's happiness as they fall in love and the subsequent outrage he feels at their mistreatment. Their refusal to submit galvanises him into open defiance. Yoko Tsukasa is wonderful as Ichi and her portrayal of determined and courageous resistance is central to the film. As is Gō Katō as  Yogoro. This film has plenty to say about how women were viewed and treated by a patriarchal system. And the limited options available. The kind of compromised self-interested choices people make and collaboration when confronted by authority was a feature here. As in other of his films. How many of those who sided against them or stayed silent, did so out of fear or trying to gain influence to protect themselves? How many because they benefited from the status quo? Watching Ichi and Yogoro stand-up for themselves and even waver at points (reacting to different pressures and fears) was genuinely moving too.I can't say enough good things about this film.

59039,"I think this is going to be one of my hot takes reviews, but don't get me wrong, I LOVE John Cassavetes, this man's creativity seems to be unlimited, but in this particular film, I couldn't connect with it in any way; it took me 4 days trying to finish, and I thought I would never make it.Opening Night has a dark energy and explores the human psychological very well, especially the complexities of artistic creation. Even with a magnificent subject and an innovative way of storytelling, I still haven't been able to emerge myself, the scenes are extremely long, and even loving slow paced movies, this one does not create any expectation in pulling my interest. Cassavetes embarks on this goal of bringing an interesting psychological drama full of emotions and metaphors, maybe a psychological drama he has achieved, but the rest was certainly not the best.Now, something here that is extremely phenomenal is the acting, especially the amazing intensity of Gena Rowlands, who, in her role, deals with the demons of her past and the existential crisis that threatens to consume her. Through several fragmented memories and surreal encounters, the film still tries to navigate the labyrinthine terrain of traumas, sorrows and self-doubts, but again, for me, this was not enough to keep me interested.I really wish I had liked it, but this exploration of the interaction between reality and performance, art and life was not enough. Although I always loved Cassavetes and experienced a BRUTAL performance by Rowlands, I would be lying to myself if I hadn't found this a boring film.",4,opening-night

It's a slow burn of events, lots of names to keep up with but it only make the build up and climax hit that much harder.

Shoutouts to Noriko for being such a complicated character, the kids could learn a thing or two from her.It's not a movie to be entertained by instead it's something to learn from, it gives you a deeply layered meaning of the word ""selfish"", and how it can be perceived in different ways depending on the person. Most importantly it teaches you how precious the time you have left with your loved ones.Overall this should be shown to anyone over the age of 30, just so they can get a warning in life lol, Noriko explained it best, it's the sad truth that children do end up drifting away from their parents, and sometimes it's too late before they realize it.",7,tokyo-story

8754,"This is a beautifully simple piece of filmmaking. We begin in the present before flashing back to the past, zeroing in on a now successful but disenchanted man, nicknamed “Toto”, as he reflects on his early life: growing up as a movie-obsessed young boy in a small, rural Sicilian village; surrounded by a host of colourful local personalities, including the town’s only projectionist, Alfredo—an impatient but benevolent presence who nurtures Toto in the absence of the latter’s father, teaching him the key aspects of his passion and trade. Over the course of the film we see Toto grow from being a cheeky and boisterous 8-year-old, into a charismatic and intelligent teen, and we witness many of the valuable life experiences he picks up along the way—repeatedly getting himself into trouble, clashing with the other villagers and cinema patrons, flirting with romance; and we see the older Toto reflecting on what could have been—the missed opportunities, the regrets, and the things he left behind when he moved away to start a new career in Rome. At the centre of every part of Toto’s story lies the Cinema Paradiso—the bustling heart of his small hometown and a place that was so pivotal to his early development, making him the man he is today.Usually a film this saccharine would have me retching uncontrollably, but the scenery-chewing performances, hazy soft-focussed visuals, and Ennio Morricone’s sugar-coated score somehow end up lending the movie just the right balance of dreamy, nostalgic sentimentalism and heartfelt emotional weight. It is, first and foremost, a coming-of-age tale that is focussed primarily on one young man’s development, but it’s arguably the Cinema Paradiso that plays the most important role in the story—its changing fortunes echoing our protagonist’s fluctuating moods and behaviours. We witness Toto’s treasured local theatre grow and foster so much warmth and love, bringing with it an enriching sense of community, only to then succumb to years of neglect before finally being pushed into obscurity. Given the film’s late-80s release, I get a sense that the film was a response to the changing movie-watching habits of the era—such as the continued rise of VHS, which was no doubt leaving its mark on cinemas globally at the time. There seem to be parallels for us today too, with the future of cinemas having been put on the line for the last 18 months or so. It’s still choppy waters for the sector right now it seems (cinema attendance remains staggeringly low here). Here's hoping it can recover.Writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore evidently just wanted to make a movie about his love and appreciation for cinema, but perhaps even more so he wanted to remind the movie-going public of just how unique and rewarding the big screen experience is. His film certainly succeeds in capturing that sentiment.",7,cinema-paradiso
85330,"TW: sexual abuse, pedophiliaLucas is an innocent man, and yet bad things happen to him. So many bad things. Then the movie ends. Before watching, the premise of the film alone felt iffy, but I knew whether I loved it or not would be extremely execution dependent. This was not the right execution. Vinterberg takes a situation that affects an entire community and boils its depiction down to a witch hunt against one man. Lucas is a victim of the situation, but he isn’t the only one. Arguably, he isn’t even the one that had it the hardest. Though it had nothing to do with Lucas, the lie in the film is still born out of an inappropriate sexual encounter involving a kindergartener which is implied to be a point of trauma for this child. The film glosses over this in favor of showing bad shit happen to Lucas. The parents of said child have to deal with believing that their kid was molested by someone they loved and trusted. They have to grapple with the belief that something so horrible happened right under their noses. The movie doesn’t really explore this and instead opts to depict... bad shit happening to Lucas. It’s this lack of empathy or interiority lent to anyone who isn’t the would-be abuser that makes me question this film’s intentions. This film is not about the actual cost of a lie, rather it’s really only about the price that Lucas has to pay. In the wake of a sexual abuse allegation, why is this film solely concerned with the hunt?(The way this movie uses women in the narrative also did not sit right with me at all.)",3,the-hunt-2012

78463,"Preminger's films are delicious in the sense that they always leave you with doubt concerning how things turn out - it feels a little too easy many times but rarely is. The way lawyers play with the ""facts"" and make-belief here makes you think of a game - just like Paul says when Manion asks how can the jury forget what they just heard: ""they can't"". In Anatomy of a Murder, Daisy Kenyon and Advice & Consent the ideal disappears beneath layers of questions and uncertainties and it's not a surprise that Rosenbaum has written that Preminger's shots pose a question. Or perhaps more precisely, other questions become more important than what at first seemed to be the case. Like here, we get a certain outcome in the trial but after that, other questions start haunting us and one comes to realize the limitations of a justice system that can see only so far. These films seem to follow conventions to a certain extent but one starts paying attention to the things that are not often talked about in courtroom dramas in this case or romances in Daisy Kenyon. It's very hard to depict the exact equation but I'm always impressed how Preminger can make such complex films out of seemingly simple scenarios. He always pushes things and here it's concretely seen in the controversy caused by the use of direct words like ""panties"" or ""sperm"" (crediting this to screenwriter feels silly if, in the end, the director has the power to abandon or embrace writer's work the way he sees fit). But where this ""pushing things"" become truly masterful is in Preminger's ability to observe his subjects from multiple angles (or perhaps if we rely more on Sarris' interpretation of his style, from one angle that offers multiple perspectives) and letting things or thoughts come and go rather freely. Even the things that seemingly do not lead anywhere become essential when power relations shift or when Preminger suddenly forces us to look at different characters - in this case, the film is at least as much about power relations between men and women in general as men and women together against the justice system. The pivotal moment that reorganizes our preoccupations is the one, possibly incorrect testimony that puts the relationship between Fredrick and Laura in a new light. Preminger makes sure the audience sees a little too much to prevent us from returning safely to our presumptions.",7,anatomy-of-a-murder

2794,"The Shawshank Redemption: one of the most overrated films of all time! Sure, it has its professional touches— flawless cinematography, a solid cast and Tim Robbins is alright, I guess— but I'm sorry, that's just not enough. At the end of the day, it's a two-hour, twenty-minute movie about a man who's locked up in prison… big deal! Andy (Robbins) was accused of murdering his spouse and the individual she was being unfaithful with. At his sentencing, he was given two life sentences despite maintaining his innocence. The exaggerated emotion and overly saccharine sentimentality are unacceptable, and it does not make much sense either; are we supposed to sympathise with a criminal? It's just not believable for me, and I'm sure I'm not alone. The film already carries a heavy dose of cheese, but there's no saving grace from its preachy dialogue, which offers little more than a ham-fisted, moralistic message. Even the climactic scene feels rushed and out of place— it's been over twenty minutes since we last saw Morgan Freeman, so it's hard to feel the emotional payoff. The Shawshank Redemption might have its fans, but for me, it's all just a tedious, trite affair.

75699,"From my piece on the best performances of 2022, writing about Paul Mescal’s approach to his character and his back acting:“What struck me in rewatching the film is how Mescal acts so marvelously with his back. In two crucial moments of the film we bear witness to this. In the first, just after Calum and Sophie have checked into their noisy Turkish hotel, Sophie sleeps, her breath bringing a sonic dimension to Calum’s presence on the balcony, where he’s clumsily trying to light a cigarette with his arm in a cast. In his back can be found tension, and then the release that comes from a good, heavy drag. The second instance comes toward the very end, after Sophie rallies some tourists into singing happy birthday to her father. Wells and her editor superimpose two images: as Calum watches the singing from above on some steps, his naked back comes into view. He’s sitting on the bed, alone and naked and crying. His body shakes with regret. His back curls and bends as if it’s an errant question mark. He’s not just overcome with sadness but sick with sorrow. We never see his face in the scene, but we don’t need to. His back tells us everything. After all, great actors use every inch of themselves.”",6,aftersun

26269,"A REVIEW FOR MY #1 LEAST FAVORITE FEATURE FILM OF MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE, AND MAYBE FOREVER WITH A 99.95% PROBABILITY.I was going to write the longest review I had ever written for Sátántangó, Tarr's infamously long so-called ""masterpiece"", which is the most pretentious and self-aggrandizing piece of shit I have ever seen. It is, to date, the worst experience I have ever had watching a film. My review was going to be really funny. I was going to make jokes about how this movie is a cult that indoctrinates everyone that views it, forcing them to sing its praises lest they seem uncultured. The proof is in the pudding for that one: the tremendous reception on this site is exactly what drew me to this film. I was going to joke about how the first critic who saw this decided to play the greatest prank in history by giving it a positive review just to force his peers to rave about it the same, lest they feel inferior. I was going to joke about how despite giving it half a star, I give it the 'like' only because the film serves as a brilliant trap, a mark of identification for all of the most pretentious and annoying ""cinephiles"" who will pretend to enjoy anything if it's long, black and white, slow, dull, and foreign enough. It is also unintentionally hilarious in its self-parody of arthouse cinema, and I can only hope and pray that Tarr intentionally shat this out as the parodial masterpiece that it is. Unfortunately, I think his intentions are nowhere so brilliant or self-aware, but entirely pretentious, which is why this movie ranks below even those like Wiseau's The Room. For all it's ineptitude, Wiseau at least had some noble intention of making “real Hollywood movie.” My review was not going to be without some form of legitimate criticism. I would have first clarified the following: I don't mind slow films, I don't mind black and white films, and I don't mind foreign arthouse cinema. I do mind it when a film uses these elements poorly. I was going to discuss how the film deliberately subverts narrative forms to serve specific purposes in building its atmosphere and themes about the examination of life and the passage of time. I was going to make the point that subversion of conventions is useful and artistically valuable to a degree to which it builds a legitimate dialogue with the audience and alerts them to these purposes. But conventions exist for a reason in cinema, and to hold on a shot of cows grazing in a field for three minutes would have accomplished building that dialogue, while holding on it for ten replaces this dialogue with self-parodying masturbation. Subversion for subversion’s sake is artless, subversion for the sake of insulting one's audience is contemptible. I would have finally pointed out that it is so disappointing Tarr is committed to making such foolishly self-defeating choices when the technical components of this are so superb: the sparsely used score, the hyperrealistic acting and long unbroken takes of dialogue scenes, the intriguingly layered and thematically rich narrative, the beautiful cinematography. Within this 7.5-hour abomination lies one of the greatest 3-hour films ever made. And after writing that long review, I was going to ask that if you thought the review was too long, pointless, and dull, then I would argue that it has precisely the same artistic merit as the 'masterpiece' it criticizes. I would then humbly request that you fellate me just as you would fellate Tarr for creating such an artistic masterpiece. To those people who know me personally and anticipated a ""real"" review knowing my disdain for this film, consider your expectations subverted--this only adds to my artistry. I also briefly considered writing this long review, but also repeating each letter five times, so that you could feel the full effect of your mind being numbed by the film. I would congratulate all those who truly enjoy this film without feeling the need to share it as a sign of artistic faux-superiority, and also kindly urge them to get their heads examined. For the rest of the people who pretend to enjoy this film and never fail to tell others they do so, my words would not have been so kind.Alas, that review shall never be written--for there is only one thing that I have learned from watching all 432 minutes of Sátántangó. Life is far too short and far too precious to spend any more time on trash like this.",0,satantango
23260,"This was a very interesting film. It was meant to be pro-communist propaganda. Its odd as everything they trash the old regime for only intensified under Castro. There were some very interestingly filmed portions of this, though I feel the first extravagant vignette is the best of the film. It details a woman's life being destroyed by the influence of nightclubs and rich people. This segment interested me as it somewhat showed how the people of Cuba viewed the people who came to vacation. I say somewhat as the film was hated in Cuba and people felt it wasn't very accurate in its portrayals. Also the Americans all seem like extras in a Suzuki film, which is likely the main reason I liked that segment. It is a very interestingly filmed movie, more an art film than anything else. Yet another reason it had such a small release originally. To me it seemed to last far too long, and to have very little substance.",2,i-am-cuba
1460,"“My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.”With an accomplishment of hitting 2,000 followers I thought I'd celebrate with the biggest number 2 in history*, The Godfather Part 2. I was debating whether or not to rewatch The Godfather before watching this but I remembered all the important parts all ready and was anxious to watch this way more than rewatching the first. Definitely glad I decided to watch this as a reward for 2,000 followers because everything everyone said was spot on.The Godfather Part 2 shows the Roman Empire like Corleone family showing itself cracking in this sequel. After the passing of Vito Corleone played by the master himself Marlon Brando, Michael Corleone must show that he can live up to his father's momentous legacy and can regain the power that was wearing down in the first film.As we see Michael struggle with family life and the life of the mafia we get brief flashbacks to Brando's Vito Corleone when he was younger. I love the use of the flashbacks as they parallel with an event Michael is having trouble with in present day. Who could recapture the mystery and intrigue of Brando for younger Vito Corleone? None other than the legend himself, Robert DeNiro. This is DeNiro’s 2nd best performance right after Travis Bickle for me as he captures the essence of Vito through the looks he gives and the presence he owns in every scene. The festival flashback is the best in my opinion mainly with the lighting, camera movements, sound design, and conclusion. A perfect scene in general.Speaking of performances everyone in this is GREAT! Al Pacino in his finest as each emotion he brings is nailed perfectly, especially his scenes with Diane Keaton who is terrific in this also. Robert Duvall is also great as a supporting role even though I think the best supporting actor in this is Bobby Cazale. Sadly one of the few films he was in he plays Fredo Corleone who is extremely relatable to me. He plays a character who thinks others don’t respect him and he wants to be looked up to like people do with his younger brother Michael. He fucks up, sure but you always understand and know he never does it from a place of hate but a place of wanting to be equal to his way more respected brother. I wish he was with us longer because he easily could have been one of the greats.Coppola’s direction is great with so many great blocking, like when his sister, Connie and fiance want Michael to approve of their marriage you see the amazing blocking Coppola does. Michael never looks at the fiance and only at Connie. He never fully faces him and when he does he is in between them holding hands, showing how he doesn’t approve of this union. It’s utterly fantastic.I want to leave off with talking about the iconic final shot. I think it’s easily the most affecting shot in the entire film. We see this broken man, Michael, who only wanted to be a normal man and not be like his father. But legacy broke him and turned him into something worse than his father wanted. He became not only everything he hated but everything his father hated. He has ruined everything in his family life and is almost unrecognizable by the end. A perfect ending for this story...well, so we thought.I want to thank you all for getting me to this big milestone. I appreciate every like and comment I get from you all and I hope to keep doing this for as long as possible. You are all my drive and without you I wouldn’t be doing this.

11301,"Joins the esteemed ranks of Attack of the Clones, Matrix Reloaded, and Dark Knight Rises in the blockbuster sequel canon. I thought the first movie did a good and clever job of adapting the source material, but something felt off from the jump this time around. I won’t go so far as to say that Villeneuve doesn’t understand Dune, but it seems like maybe what interests him about the book just isn’t what I find interesting. He spends an unforgivable amount of time belabouring Paul’s desert wanderings and Fremen training — stuff that should have been covered in part one and actually already feels like it was, thoroughly — and then races through the stuff that, imo, actually matters about this story, namely Paul’s awakening, the time he spends unconscious/borderline dead, and the birth of his sister (as well as her capture, killing of the Baron, and so on). This first movie’s changes gave the whole thing a certain sensible economy; this time it felt alternately boring and rushed, and frustratingly skimpy on the intergalactic geopolitics and machinations of plot that Herbert so carefully threads together on the page. A lot of the elisions strike me as cowardice: I can’t think of any reason to leave out Alia’s birth except the fear of a talking baby looking ridiculous, which, whatever your opinion of Lynch’s version, isn’t the kind of thing he’d run away from. A core problem with both movies and with Denis generally is that while he always very diligently and thoughtfully builds out any object, vehicle, location, or piece of costuming so that it looks original and interesting and real, he almost always retreats from anything conceptually, intellectually, aesthetically outside his grasp, which means that Dune often looks cool but rarely feels surprising. It’s the difference between creativity and imagination. You think a big brainy Guild Navigator floating in a vat of goo is gonna ruin the steely #OnePerfectShot vibe of your serious movie? Let loose, man! Risk looking lame to achieve the sublime!",3,dune-part-two
62334,"You were born to be murdered.Orson Welles has to have one of the most attractive faces in cinematic history. Not even in a way where he's handsome (Though I would say he is or at least was.) but more in a way where your eyes are immediately drawn to him whenever he's onscreen. For having in terms of screen-time a smaller part, he leaves his impact on The Third Man, and perhaps his performance is part of what makes this movie a strong work in the noir and mystery genres. I can say that it could better, the plot could be slightly easier to follow, but the necessary details and the effort for some bits of flair are there. The direction is at times great, some close-ups and a slew of dutch angles standing out without ever getting repetitive or too distracting. The plotting itself even with its slight confusion provides us an intriguing post-World War II world to inhabit. Even as the war has ended, corruption and grasping for control remains. It just goes back into the shadows instead of the battlefield. I think I am also going to always be a sucker for someone who works in entertainment, here our protagonist being a writer of pulp novels, getting wrapped up in the kinds of event they would craft in their own head.

82495,"*Twitch Redeem by AlwaysDying.*School of Rock (2003) and Mean Girls (2004) meet a high-school comedy anime and the result is... harmless fun! Really, I have a switch that is permanently ON in my brain that is against the phenotype of this type of Disney-channel-like “comedies”: a cascade of hormones, high-class teenage problems (“Oh my, the protagonist cannot afford a Prada bag!”), ridiculous situations and “problems” (“We’re being chased by a wild animal!”), and musical numbers out of nowhere: Zac Efron, Lindsay Lohan, Miley Cyrus, you name it.Except, it isn’t like that... at all. It doesn’t have any of the aforementioned elements (save for the animal sequence, but it is shot in an inventive way that you smile with the ridiculousness of it, even if I’d bet there could’ve been a better song choice). The spirit is wholesome and, contrary to all logical expectations, one wouldn’t think that such a big collective cast would have good character balance, let alone chemistry between each other. Well, they do, and it shows. Five characters do take a greater relevance, but a whole machinery of conflicts and personalities lies behind them, and they are not invisible. Visible characters are always welcome. It’s always a positive sign.It is extremely important to know that all the instrumental music you hear during the rehearsal and concert sequences is the actual music played by the actors, no exceptions made. Ergo, they do play intentionally bad during the beginning and had to attune for differing levels of skill with the instruments, until culminating in a wonderful, prolonged final act that will have you smiling, clapping and ramping the volume like crazy much more than Linklater’s odd piece.I have good memories from School of Rock (2003) and was my favorite Jack Black movie when I was 13 (heh); I remember the dynamic between the group being utmost effective and the writing of the female teacher was the most interesting one. Tina Fey also penned a fine screenplay for Mean Girls (2004) undermined by a cringe directing and situation choices. This takes all of that away and, without being revolutionary in absolutely anything, this will cheer any bad week you might have had. This flick screams to be played during a Saturday afternoon, where you don’t even have to worry about working the next day (for those that apply).Against all my forecasts, this is highly recommended for those that can apply suspension of disbelief and be taken away for a while.75/100",6,swing-girls

39447,"76/100An observant, intimate look at a Japanese family and it's dynamics.At times I felt quite uncomfortable watching this film. It is set in the home of an elderly couple whose grown up son and daughter and their own respective families are coming for a reunion dinner in order to commemorate the drowning of their eldest son some years earlier when he was a youth. Whilst there is the traditional deference you'd expect from children to parents, it soon becomes clear that the mother especially is no stickler for protocol, and her questioning of her son and his wife (whose own relationship is at times quite strained) about their own baby plans soon leads us to further exploration of all the aspirations and demons of those gathered around the table. It has been probably twenty years since my family had any sort of cross-generational repast, and there are certainly parts of this that ring true as the personalities of all concerned even the youngsters start to impose themselves on the ordinarily structured lives of all gathered together. That brings an authenticity to the scenario. There are no fights, tantrums, or squabbles but it is clear from our observations that there are soft, vulnerable, points in each of their characters and that all of them are looking to the future in differing (and shorter-term) ways. Kirin Kiki - the mother probably steals this for me, but the remainder of the ensemble cast deliver a touching, challenging and personal story with surety and delicacy. That's not to say this is in any way soporific, or slow it isn't; it just allows the story to breathe and for us to appreciate the carefully crafted characterisations as the forty-eight hours, or so, of the visit unfolds.For me, as a person with an European cultural background, it was also very interesting to see how this family story that includes problems between parents and children characteristic for every culture, looks in the context of Japanese Shintoist and Budhist traditions. That is what I expect from a good movie: to touch topics common for the all human race and to show it in the context of specific cultures. The greatest strenght of it would be on it's script, mainly for it's sharp dialogue. The dialogue were out of the world, Every character has its own point of view that you understand and you sympathize with by the incredible cast they portray them. The direction is impressive. Hirokazu directed the fantastic dialogues between the characters without moving the camera a lot that makes you in the scene with the characters.This film has also one of my favorite criterion covers, which is the poster that Letterboxd selected for it.

It is a long shot in which Marta is alone captured on the screen and she does an unbelievable job in that one particular scene. I couldn't move my sight off her and it was like she's staring into my eyes and talking to me and me alone. Bergman's conversatinal segments always amaze me but in this film it was bit higher than expected.This is strong stuff, maybe the greatest film about faith and the lack of it ever made. Gunnar Björnstrand, so perfect in so many Bergman films, gives the performance of a lifetime here, unforgettable. This film hit me like a ton of bricks.

32980,"At one point I fell asleep. That was probably the only positive thing I can say about this one, that I got to catch up on sleep.In defense of my unexplained hatred :Okay okay okay I should have explained the sour taste in my mouth rather than trying to make a joke. For the record though, I LOVED Solaris, so I don't think I have some unreasonable vendetta of Tarkovsky's work.As far as this one goes, it's not exactly a narratively based film, so I don't think I'd be going out on a limb by saying that by not knowing that going in, it was a frustrating film to sit through. There were a couple points were I felt like an actual cohesive story was about to develop but it never came, which just made that feeling worse. It jumped around all over the place and had actors playing multiple roles. The issue being that I found no discernible way to tell which characters they were supposed to be playing at any given time, they were just flat performances to me.Lastly, Tarkovsky's use of long takes here just absolutely killed me. I actually loved them in Stalker (a film that I did not love as a whole) and found the camera work in general one of the only redeeming qualities of that movie. But here, in Mirror they just made me want to turn it off. Maybe it's because there's really nothing going on to push the story forward, and by lingering on an open field for 90 seconds it only made the dearth of content here all the more obvious to me.If I missed the point on some of the ""story"" (i'm sure I did), I can safely say that I won't be going back to revisit it. This just wasn't for me, unfortunately that happens from time to time.",1,mirror
33937,"Initial thoughtsWas air playing this from the rare film archive on my phone and was fully absorbed with this film and watched the whole thing in one sitting.  But after a while the atmosphere wears off and the purposefully slow nature of the film that practically takes it plot and characters nowhere began to just wear me out and completely bore me.  overall perspective From a thematic perspective I understood the loss of childhood and the mediation on nihilism and the meanings of life.  Theo is easily an amazing filmmaker.  The lingering long takes are beautiful and so is the staging. There are so many pretty scenes but that’s what bugged me about this film.  It felt like there were so many good scenes but that together they couldn’t stand together as a whole.  From a writing perspective I just feel like I had to ask myself at what point do the scenes become unnecessary?  Dialogue So much of the dialogue also felt pretty faux intellectual, which is something I understand in sci-fi or political commentary but when it gets put into a drama it saps away the realism.“Who am I? I'm a snail slithering away into nothingness... I don't know where I'm going. Once I thought I knew.”“If I were to shout, who would hear me out of the armies of angels?“ (at least this dialogue is from one character Orestis but he never felt believable to me because his traveling circus plot/backstory was never fleshed out and he feels like he only fulfills the role of symbolic father figure)How people approach the film Obviously the directing and story is amazing but I’ll always lean the film criticism route that pushes more for enjoyment/textual conflict and characterization than just an analysis of the subtextual depth and symbolism as most have resorted to.  Conflict/characterization Landscape in the mist lacks a lot of conflict.  It’s mostly internal yet there is no internal monologue unless you count the letters. A lot of the characterization of the children feels very one note. The external conflict lacks depth.  We learn early on the children are illegitimate (why would they tell us this so early if it fully reduces the audiences investment in the story if they know it’s pointless already then doesn’t that lessen the impact overall) and whilst the point of the story is meaningless-ness I still felt not enough scenes were servicing the story to move the characters forward.  Wouldn’t It have helped if we had understood the mother’s motivations for leaving the children?  Wouldn’t it have at least helped if we had known the fabrications of the fathers life told to the children?  Yeah.Overuse of symbolism It’s not even that I don’t like slow cinema because I love a brighter summer day but this fucking movie man.  How much poetry and symbolism helps?  A child looking at a dead horse with a wedding in the background is symbolic but why is this long take so extended?  A shot of a finger being pulled out of the water is cool but that symbolism doesn’t impact the characters.  It’s not even in the background, it’s a long scene.  The symbolism for me actively takes me out of the story by drawing attention to the story itself.  So at what point does making your movie slow and over extending scenes even service the story you’re telling if it’s mostly just allegory/symbolism? Message/ending The thing that sticks out to me the most from this movie was spoilers the rape scene which I totally appreciated how it was framed so as not to feel exploitable ( but at what point does that impact the story onward and if anything it does feel fetishist and unnecessary ) and the ending, which may have been optimistic or nihilistic depending on how you view it.  Did they die at the end and enter the afterlife?  Did they live? Again like others have said I appreciate the filmmaking but this is an overly symbolic script that can’t even manage to give its characters any depth other than the themes they’re made to represent.  At least Bergman has the philosophical musings of characters with heart (for his non dramas at least.)TLDR:shallow misery porn.",2,landscape-in-the-mist

80323,"You know that, after the war, we had very bad years in Germany. We got poorer and poorer. Every day retired officers or schoolteachers were caught shoplifting. Money lost its value, the price of everything rose except of human beings. We read in the newspapers that the after-war years were bad everywhere, that crime was increasing and that honest citizens were having a hard job to put the gangsters in jail. Well in Germany, the gangsters finally succeeded in putting the honest citizens in jail.A fascinating decades-spanning narrative focusing on a variety of themes such as friendship, honour, identity, legacy and love. The deliberate humanization of Theo's character, a move that faced public disapproval in wartime England, emerges as a profound statement, and for me is the absolute best part of this screenplay. Theo's nuanced portrayal serves as a poignant testament to the struggles faced by decent, ordinary Germans under the rising brutality of the Nazi Party during the pre-war era.

DeNiro's construction of this hopelessly tragicomic character is nothing short of masterful and seriously on contention for being among the greatest in a career already replete of ridiculously great performances. The approach Scorsese utilizes to structure this story look as if would be ludicrously complex to get right, but its brilliant execution is just so remarkably seamlessly done it never jumps out from the rest of the film like it often happens in some of his other productions.

Although I think I might respect his choices more if they weren't all so painfully set up to be art. I mean I wish he occasionally pulled away from the dead space long shots of people reading and bathing. A lot of people criticize Hollywood films, myself included, for doing the opposite and just showing epic emotional scenes. But there has to be a middle ground because I felt just as manipulated by Amour as I did with something like Big Fish. Both done completely differently but both hammering you in the skull. One just uses a bigger hammer.So Amour's story is simple, excruciatingly simple. I like that because it makes you look for more in the story and the relationship. If we know how this story plays out from the beggining than we have to find something to hold our interest and Haneke makes sure we only have certain things to look at, mainly two elderly folks and their relationship. The problem for me is when you have long takes with a stationary camera and not a whole lot is happening I start to wonder about the room and the camera angle and the wall colors and how I need popcorn and how her blanket is tilted and... Eventually my mind wanders from the scene at hand and after 5 or 6 of these things I really start to feel put off because the director is trying to force me to find something that just isn't always there. I don't like that feeling. I don't like feeling the inevitable,  "" I'm gonna cry now"" feeling. I don't like knowing that I'm going to be pretty dulled out by the climax. Yes there are great qualities with Amour. Some scenes are great. I like the dynamic between their daughter. I like the idea of claustrophobia in the apartment. I love the big scene at the end. And I like the last scene. Now I may just be burnt out on European films that are naturalistic( ie Morvern Callar, 4 months 3 weeks, etc). I feel that way about serious indies as well( ie Winters Bone, Martha Marcy May, etc). I like those movies but when I rip Hollywood films for recycling the same style and format that has come before wIth success I have to attack the indie art house world for going back to the same well. I don't know if I ever want to revisit this. Like Certified Copy before it I appreciate these movies. Artfully and tastefully done with a great hand behind the camera and in front. It made me think and got me to question values. But it doesn't get my emotions. And it doesn't excite me the way that other art house movies do.

75970,"Mary and Max is a grim, death-oriented modern fairy tale that ultimately shines with humanity and sincerity. It's a necessary and brutally honest representation of mental illness and bad formative years' impact on individuals, despite its overabundance of plot twists that may rub one the wrong way.Chronicling the spiritual connections between an Australian girl and a New York man who accidentally become pen pals and share each other's loneliness and personal ordeals, Mary and Max is first and foremost gothic in the most poetically depressing manner possible, thanks to its claymation format and director Adam Elliot's stylish choices to externalize the internal struggles of the main characters. Death and suffering serve as the eternal theme of this pessimist tale as they keep piling on top of each other until the credit rolls, regardless of credibility or the risks of sounding cliched, which is probably my biggest, or maybe my only gripe of Mary and Max.Other than that, Mary and Max hits almost every mark a top-notch, thematically relevant animation could ever aim for. Impressive style, great voice performances from its ensemble especially from the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, and its abundant heart and soul that's simply effective even for the most stone-cold audience. It's one of the best indie animations that tackles the touchy theme of mental illness, if not the best (Anomalisa is for me). Recommended.",6,mary-and-max

7990,"The 'Matrix Revolutions' of anime movies -- half-baked, pretentious, and completely incoherent.To say I have mixed feelings about 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' as a whole is an understatement. After spending the past couple weeks making my way through the TV series, I can confidently say it's pretty fucking horrible. And I do say that knowing it's beloved by seemingly an entire generation of anime viewers, widely considered to be a game-changer for the whole genre. What, was anime lacking in Freudian pseudo-psychology before this or something?I went into this series knowing only that it was considered by many to be a masterpiece; a supposed blend of intimate character study and complex, layered, meaningful storytelling. To say I had high hopes is an understatement.And I don't think I can adequately put into words what a colossal disappointment it was.Yes, on one hand the ""story"" -- if you can even call it that -- is nearly entirely character-driven, and I suppose that's worthy of praise. On the other hand, I found nearly all of its characters to be one of three things: bland and boring (as is Rei), self-absorbed and unlikable (as is Asuka), or boring AND unlikable (as is Shinji). If these characters really are intended to be facets of director Hideaki Anno's personality, I don't even want to imagine what an insufferable narcissist the man might be.Toward the end of the series it even starts to seem that Anno is actively going out of his way to make his characters as putrid and detestable as possible: 13-year-old Asuka begs a 30-year-old man to rape her, while Shinji masturbates onto an unconscious girl in a hospital.Did I mention this is a series about giant mechs fighting giant aliens? If that sounds completely random and out-of-place with the characters' above actions, well, it is.What on earth is it that makes people like this series? I want to say it's the stellar animation, but that might be giving it too much credit since the series apparently ran afoul of budget issues halfway through and relied on still-image slideshows and recycled shots for the entire last few episodes. I find it hard to believe anything else about the show is beloved. The characters are unlikable without even being interesting, the plot is a load of contrived nonsense, and the entire attitude of the series is so puffed-up, self-important, and full of hot air that I'm surprised Hideaki Anno didn't float away into the sky midway through production. The creators clearly wanted to make some grand statement about human nature, but they also clearly couldn't figure out what the hell they wanted to say. 'Evangelion' throws a metric fuckton of characters, plot elements, Christian symbolism, and Freudian psychology at you, but doesn't once take the time and care to make any of it comprehensible. A Jackson Pollock painting? This is more like a toddler tossing paint at a wall. Call it ""modern art,"" I guess (ew).There are some things to admire, don't get me wrong. The animation is pretty stellar (when the show is animated at all, that is), and I even got a kick out of the series' weird detours into avant-garde abstraction. One of the biggest criticisms of the series is the way its last two episodes devolve into a jumble of pseudo-philisophical drivel, but ironically that jumble of drivel was the most entertaining part of the entire ordeal. It was genuinely hilarious to watch the show abandon all pretenses of wanting to tell an intelligible story. The creators clearly threw their hands in the air and screamed, ""Fuck it, we're turning this into a student film!""And if there's one positive thing I can say about the original ending to the TV series, it's that AT THE VERY LEAST it allowed its protagonist to grow. Shinji Ikari is a pathetic narcissist for practically the entire show, only growing out of his teenage wangst in the closing moments of the final episode. Sure, it took him the entire fucking series to learn an ounce of self-awareness, but at least he learned something eventually, goddammit.But in this? Shinji remains completely and utterly static. He begins the story as a whiny brat and he ends the story as a whiny brat. He doesn't learn anything, he doesn't grow, and he never once becomes a character worth watching. It's insufferable.I'm not even going to try and delve into the hundreds of illogicalities, plot inconsistencies, and poorly-explained or unexplained story elements. In order to just follow what the hell is going on, you would have to take ten pages worth of notes on every episode -- something which I can't be fucked to do, because the series never gave me a reason to care enough in the first place. In the end, I'm just left with a thousand unanswered questions.What exactly is Adam? What exactly are Angels? What exactly are Evas? How exactly do Evas have human souls? How did humans manage to transfer their souls into the Evas? How exactly did humans manage to quantify human souls to begin with? Is there any real logic behind any of this, or were the creators simply pulling things out of their asses in an attempt to look intelligent? Probably the latter, as Anno has gone on record stating that he named the show 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' simply because it ""sounded complicated.""From what I've seen and read on this wonderful cesspool we call the internet, fans of 'Evangelion' seem to have a pre-prepared go-to defense against this kind of criticism: ""You're just not smart enough to understand it. You just didn't pay enough attention. You just don't know enough about Gnosticism and the existential philosophies of Soren Kierkegaard.""Which just might be the epitome of obnoxious condescension. Clearly it's MY fault for not understanding things the series didn't take the proper time to explain. Clearly I'm just the village idiot, and 'Evangelion' is on a higher intellectual level than me. Clearly it's NOT just the driveling of a pretentious lunatic.TL;DR -- 'Neon Genesis Evangelion' is pseudo-intellectual bullshit.",1,neon-genesis-evangelion-the-end-of-evangelion

And the juxtaposition between the two perfectly frames this thematically rich John Ford western about a lawman and the cowboy that would come to have his back. ""Whoa, take 'er easy there, Pilgrim.""(Quick Hits) ... Spoilers:- My head had been spinning for years wondering who was Liberty Valance, and who shot him? And I am glad I dove into this story blind, since this flashback-styled narrative was far different than what I imagined- The story opens with a famous politician traveling to an unnamed western location to mourn the loss of an old friend of his. The local press want to know what their relationship was all about, so he goes on to tell them about his legendary feud with Liberty Valance- Andy Devine and Woody Strode do look younger in the flashback, but not Stewart whose profession as a lawyer apparently always had him looking old- Additional familiar faces from this all-star cast include Lee Marvin, Lee Van Cleef, and as previously mentioned John Wayne who is the guy Stewart goes to mourn - The flashback starts with Stewart as an older-looking young up-start lawyer whose stagecoach gets robbed by Valance's gang, and then Stewart gets the crap beat out of him when he tries to stand up to them- I don't know if John Wayne was famous for calling people Pilgrim in a lot of movies, but he sure does say it often in this one- If you are a fan of Disney's 'Robin Hood', you will quickly recognize the voice of Andy Devine who plays the pathetic marshall in the town who is not afraid to dodge trouble or bum a meal- Stewart gets helped out by the family who runs the town restaurant, which also helps keep him at the center of the town drama- Those ladies working the restaurant sure did not want any help from a man with running their kitchen and dining room ... my mom is the same way ... while my wife has no problem putting me to work in the kitchen- I am not sure if it is just because it is in black and white, but The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance feels like it came out much earlier than 1962- When you just listen to John Wayne's accent on his own he sounds so corny, but when he is squaring off against another brute ... there is no question who you would have your money on in a duel- Amusing to see the town drunk/journalist be so opposed to taking public office at first. But boy does Valance have a way with that whip of his as he viciously beats him down- No worries Jimmy, I suck at shooting too- The whole movie I thought surely John Wayne is the one going to kill Valance, and I was baffled at first when it appeared that the guy telling the story was the one that killed him- Valance getting shot happens awkwardly and quick, so I was not surprised later on to hear that John Wayne was the one who took him out- It was neat to hear the dispute between cattlemen wanting the west to remain a territory, while the people in town wanted to become a state. It is a shame we never learn where they actually are- There is also a love triangle at work here as Hallie starts out engaged to John Wayne, but he allows her to be with Stewart instead by the end since she will have a better life by becoming literate and marrying a politician    - I am surprised the movie does not lean on the deceit more that Stewart had the aid of being perceived to have killed a tough Western outlaw to help him look strong and launch his political career. Instead Stewart and Wyane's characters quickly just accept the agreement - Although Valance's gang and the rep for the cattlemen sure made Valance out to be as harmless as a fly          ""You're not going to use the story, Mr. Scott? ... No, sir. This is the West, sir.

How futile the fight for truth and justice, how rich fuckers can get away with anything, and how we're all helpless bystanders to the normalization of our oppression under ruthless capitalistic masters. but as a young woman who has personally endured sexual harrassment from a family member (and was met with nonchalance from other family members who know) in my preteen years, watching those last ten minutes was hell for me. it also doesn't help that a monster like Polanski depicted a female survivor of underage rape in his movie, insists on the death of that same character to prove his point, then turns around and does the exact fucking thing himself. perhaps the biggest irony is that in the movie, it's Jack Nicholson's character that naively leads Noah Cross to Katherine; and in real life, Polanski rapes an underaged girl in Jack Nicholson's house. now that's one sick joke, man. i am aware that this is just my two cents on the movie, which is very much influenced by my own experiences. i do separate art from artist, but it's hard to appreciate the quality of the art when its canvas is hypocrisy. so no, i don't think i'll ever forget Chinatown and how it made me feel.",0,chinatown
79665,"I’m about to violate my own rule about giving away too much personal information online. If you’re not interested in that, please feel free to skip this, but I feel it’s necessary to describe where I’m at with Amour.My mom died on January 4th, 2018. Cancer sucks. It had metastasized, and she had chosen to not undergo treatment once it was found to be as aggressive as it was. Everyone informed understood her perspective; the treatment was set to take quite a lot out of her, and the potential benefit was minimal. She also chose not to enter hospice, and lived out her final few months at home with her husband. Her birthday was on Christmas Eve, so I brought my daughters, then aged 5 and 11, over for a few hours both that day and the next. I had seen my mom just the week before, and we talked every day, as we always did. But on her birthday, something was noticeably wrong. While most of what she said was fine, she was starting to stumble over words. I asked if she was okay, and she said she was just tired. All good, I took her at her word.When we returned the next day for Christmas, she was unable to articulate a coherent thought together for more than a few words, much like what happens in this movie with Anne (Emmanuelle Riva). The speech patterns were stilted, unusual, the words were all English but didn’t make sense as a string of thought. The only lucid thought she got out that day was when she pulled me aside privately and said, “Don’t bring the girls back here.”This is not a terribly unique experience. Plenty of people have had loved ones pass, and under very similar circumstances. I’m also not looking for any expressions of sympathy or empathy by bringing any of this up, as you have gone through something similar, as well, I’m sure. And, as far as the movie tells us, Anne’s body fails her after a stroke, so the parallel isn’t perfect.But I’m always going to remember that sinking feeling when my mom’s speech wasn’t right. And I point it out because I was left pretty cold seeing it again. I’ve already been through this, so there was nothing for me to glean from this film. There is no deeper understanding for me to get from this. I already got that experience, just like so many others have.Is it a well-made film? Sure. My mom’s death didn’t have a controversial final act, so I guess that’s something, but I also found that so alien to my own way of thinking that I just blew it off. I’m sure the movie is an effective portraiture of processing change and grief to many, and I hope that everyone else who watched it got something from it. I didn’t. It didn’t put me in an emotional place, it didn’t jog up sniffles or anything like that, it just … left me flat entirely. That’s possibly a very strange reaction, but we all carry our own weird baggage, and mine didn’t let me connect with any of this material.",4,amour
20437,"Mima Kirigoe: Excuse me... who are you? Excuse me... who are you?Perfect Blue is about idol life and the consequences it brings to those who live from it. If it's not a surprise already to know that idol life can be hard in the everyday life of these artists, it's a whole other level in Asian countries, especially in South Korea and Japan (from what I was told).Mima's is also quite specific, because it shows how young girls are often used as sexual images (just look at her evolution, which begins with her rather erotic dress during her concert), a person who, in the end, turns into a product whose image is sold, a person who is manufactured to become a perfection for fans.This world of idol therefore brings mental scars. I think it is no coincidence that there is the blue colour mentioned in the title; blue usually alludes to sadness, melancholy or depression. Mima is facing such stress and demands for effort, and on top of that she has to deal with a stalker (who by the way really scared me, I think I'll see him in my nightmares anytime soon) that haunts her and degrades her privacy on the Internet (this part of the film was really great, to see the beginning of the Internet like that to realize that in the end, some 20 years before, this type of problem was already happening). Perhaps a detail that is not necessarily true, but it also seems to me that blue can designate something erotic when it comes to movies.However, if blue carries a certain importance in the theme of the film, it is not especially the dominant colour. I noticed that Satoshi Kon has a certain attraction to red, and it is a colour that is found all the time, no matter the mentality of Mima. I'm not yet sure what the red colour might have as meaning, perhaps the violence of the protagonist who is in her inner-self, a way maybe to show the extremes she must face in her new career.The mental aspect is also really well represented by the cuts and transitions that are usually vivid and pass from one time of the day to another, accentuating the confusion not only of Mima but also of the viewer. And this wounded mentality can only be seen in Mima, but also in his obsessed fan Me-Mania (again, the guy really creeps me).There's this infamous scene that many know or have heard about this movie, and that's the scene where Mima plays a girl who gets raped in a strip club. I think I have nothing to add to this because it's a key scene that actually triggers Mima's madness, but I just wanted to make it clear that it's not an easy scene to watch (a friend of mine told me that he almost walk away from the movie theatre when Perfect Blue was rebroadcast, and I have to admit that I had a hard time hiding my disgust in front of that scene). All I'm saying is that if you're going to watch this anime, get ready to see a scene that's uneasy to watch, or at least if you don't think you can watch it, avoid it because the rest of the movie is still worth seeing.I think Mik said it best, if David Lynch were to start making an anime, then Perfect Blue would be his work.

83308,"Makato Shinkai can't claim ignorance on the issue of consent: Your Name points out on multiple occassions that Taki shouldn't be taking advantage of Mitsuha's body when they body swap.  Yet the film plays his boundary crossing as a joke or has him lie about it with no consequences. Heading off the boring counter argument at the pass, my complaint isn't that Taki does these things. A teenage boy raised in this society who didn't feel up the woman whose body he controlled would sadly be the exception rather than the rule. My complaint is that the filmmakers completely downplay this problem. No one forced them to include it, and they do nothing to comment on it. So it hangs there, like a fart in a crowded elevator.This is a consistent problem with Shinkai's films: he sees romance as a sort of trump card for real life. But pretending that love wipes away the problems of real life leads to abusive relationships and imperialist fantasies. In Garden of Words, he posits a non sexual relationship between a mid to late 20s woman (who is also a teacher) and a 15 year old student because it doesn't explicitly involve sex is ok, but it isn't. It involves the idea of sex and romantic love being constricted by dumb ole society, but those rules (unlike many) are actually there for a reason. They protect people.For me, real romance doesn't have to hide reality to be love. In fact the foundation of real love is an acceptance of the flaws and strengths in the reality of said person. Given a slight shift in the writing, Shinkai's naive sincerity might appeal to me in a similar way to the Wachowski sisters*. They both have an ability to achieve transcendent imagery because of that heart, for lack of a better term. The scene where Taki slips in the cave will easily make my best scenes of the year for instance. But the Wachowski's sincerity is always about imagining a better world in spite of the pitfalls of this one. Shinkai's sincerity is invested in only his perspective and a better world only for the type of person he is, a young male straight** romantic.* Though that leads them to problem areas as well** This movie should be way more LGBT, emphasis on the T, than it is2/15",1,your-name

73378,"Scavenger Hunt #111 June 2024:Watch a film about stand-up comedy or watch a stand-up comedy special.Watched: 7/30Forgot to write my review for this film earlier, which is not a reflection on the quality. Martin Scorsese directs a great film (how many times have we heard that by now?) and his partnership with Robert De Niro is one of the finest in Hollywood. I can see numerous similarities between this and the 2019 amazing origin film Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix in the leading role. It feels like this film clearly inspired the works of Joker and what The King of Comedy does particularly well is the use of the royal red colour in frame and the context in how it is used to symbolise Robert De Niro’s character, Rupert Pupkin and his delirious state of mind living in his own royal celebrity fantasy.The story and the social commentary is incredibly aware of the responsibility famous people have in maintaining distance from their fans in order to keep a level of safety, not only for themselves but to others as well. Rupert’s fixated obsession on fame, fortune and status drives him beyond reason to perform acts that cross moral boundaries and his narcissistic personality dictates his actions leading to disastrous consequences. His desire to achieve the heights of comedian show host Jerry Langford (Jerry Lewis) ignores any dismissals or rejections and this ultimately brings Rupert to take matters into his own hands in order to gain control again of his dream that is fading before his eyes.The representation of all parties is directed fantastically and Martin Scorsese doesn’t shy away from throwing shade at other famous stars who lack moral integrity.Although it’s a solid 4 stars from me, it only sits in the middle of my ranking from Scorsese’s collection, which is testament to how prestigious of a director he is, commonly considered the greatest director of all time.My Scavenger Hunt - June 2024Martin Scorsese - Ranked",7,the-king-of-comedy
73046,"Before Upton Sinclair's 'Oil' was adapted, Nicolas Roeg's Eureka struck paydirt and ore with this harrowingly esoteric tale about a gold prospector in Alaska. Roeg spellbinds the audience with supernatural mysticism (an oracle gazes into a crystal ball as Jack McCann (Gene Hackman) spelunks into a brothel). Only Roeg could embroider a tapestry of post-apocalyptic images in the Arctic village below where the denizens are putting pistols in their mouths outside the claims office. McCann's capitalism is an act of cryptic divinity and a Faustian contract after he acquires a crystalline stone. The land deal for the island in which the McCanns now luxuriate, is the centerpiece of the picture and with that, Joe Pesci seizes his Yiddish mafioso role with Edward G, Robinson seediness. Rutger Hauer is commendably rabble-rousing as Jack's playboy son-in-law who is adamant that Jack ""raped the Earth"" for his mammon. On top of that, the scenes between Hauer and Theresa Russell are supercharged with carnal vigor. After a stint, the film does splutter into monotony around Jack's paranoia. The spirituality discussions blather incoherently and upon an African ceremony scene, the momentum ripples to a stoppage. Had the film been more taut, it would be a masterpiece.

That said, from that point on, it's lights-out. Kobayashi is, among other things, a master of composition, especially in action sequences and it's never been more obvious than here: just look at any frame in the second half of this and tell me it's anything less than great. Any action here is worth going on about, but the last 10 minutes, in particular, are breathtaking. Meticulous compositions to hold meticulously choreography to convey abject despair and hopelessness — what else would you want a samurai movie to do? The closing images are some of the best I've seen from Kobayashi and given his body of work, that's saying A Lot.

31365,"A fine combination of screenplay and performances, character and attitude,  Joseph Mankiewicz's ""All About Eve"" is a comedy of manners and a drama of infiltration. Following a woman who inserts herself into the life and livelihood of a New York stage actress, the film sends up the world of theater while making statements about age, rivalry, and appearances. It is a rich and appealing experience. Bette Davis stars as Margo Channing, an well-known actress who may be beginning the downward slop of her career. Making matters worse is Anne Baxter's Eve Harrington, a seemingly sweet go-getter who becomes Margo's assistant and, soon, rival. The plot follows the friends, coworkers, and others linked to Margo and Eve as Eve begins a rise that might put Margo in her shadow. It is a compelling, human drama with notes of satire, humor, and self-awareness.The film boasts an outstanding screenplay. Layered and dense passages of biting, amusing, and knowing dialogue tie together characters who are fully rendered and a story that clicks. Joseph Mankiewicz's writing is outstandingly full-bodied.As director, Mankiewicz keeps things flowing narratively and dramatically thanks, mostly, to his two leads. Bette Davis give a layered performance that is graceful, angry, and lively. As the actress, she is theatrically overwrought. As a the woman who is facing a career crossroads, she is vulnerable and human. Baxter is also a stand-out, creating an initially likable character that hides the ambitious, conniver lurking within.With its excellent screenplay and high quality performances, ""All About Eve"" is a fully engaging film. A drama with enough amusing moments to things light, the film is a well-assembled and perceptive piece of work. It may all be a little cynical, but a sly, mirthful edge ensures an appealing balance of scowls and winks.",7,all-about-eve

It's as simple as that.""SPOILERS AHEAD.The Truman Show is a haunting existential tragedy. Now, the movie doesn't end on a dour note—which is a relief—but as the YouTube channel MakeBetterMedia states,""While this movie seemingly has a happy ending, I think a good number of people realise it's not going to stay that way . . . After realising everything Truman has known turned out to be a lie, how could he possibly trust anything ever again? . . . If someone were to just hold the door open for him, he'd have to wonder why. Would it be because they're just polite, or would it be because he's Truman, or were they told to do that by some scriptwriter? And that paranoia would seep into every facet of his life. His mother, father, wife and best friend were all manufactured relationships; how could he get close to anyone without wondering whether or not they'd been fed lines from someone else?"" — MakeBetterMediaFrom the start, the movie is quick to characterise Truman as a lovable guy. He's funny, kind, and honest with his intentions. When you see him long for something that he'll never be able to reach, it's easy to feel sorry for him. He's likable, but he lacks agency.Marlon: ""Nothing you see on this show is fake. It's merely controlled.""As stated earlier, the show builds Truman's relationships upon lies and manipulation. They weren't real, even if Truman was. But if lies control his reactions and personality, doesn't that also make him a lie?Christoff: ""There's no more truth out there than there is in the world I created for you. Same lies. The same deceit.""This statement has unfortunately aged very well. With the spread of misinformation, on top of humanity's habit of miscommunication, are the truths we or outside forces (the internet, social media and algorithms) cultivate as bad as Truman's or worse? If so, how do we break our fourth wall; how do we meet with our puppet masters and tell them if we want this fabricated reality?All I want to say is that this movie resonates with me. Truman's likability (with credit to Jim Carrey's exceptionally cartoonish yet endearing performance) and this movie's confronting questions are ones that really make me think. There are so many big questions with no definite answers. So, I guess all we can do is find ways to seize our freedom, knowledge and agency.

73501,"""...someday we may look back on this and decide that saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god awful shitty mess.."" Before The United States of America joined the fight in World War II there were four Ryan brothers, all of which enlisted when called to duty. Within the same week as the storming of Normandy beach three of those four brothers died, and the fourth, James, the youngest, was airdropped behind enemy lines. It's up to Captain John H. Miller and seven of his bravest soldiers to infiltrate the most dangerous of situations and rescue Private James Ryan to bring him home to his mother.I planned on watching  The Patriot  since it's Independence Day but it's not currently streaming on any of the services I have. It left me a bit disappointed but still in the mood to watch a war film. Since I have a bit of extra time and the war flick itch, it's finally time to review  Saving Private Ryan.  This is the film that cemented Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in their war flick phase with the two collaborating later on as executive producers on the HBO series  Band of Brothers.  Considering the whole dynamic of this film, I think they had that title and intent in mind before this one even stopped shooting.Even those who never saw this film are aware of it's opening scene, the half hour long storming of Normandy Beach. Brutal destruction and gore and the depiction of the emotional toll suffered by those who were lucky to survive. The kind of men that stand taller than most. Powerful stuff, and it's only half of the first act to a film that resides on a level in which few do.I'd like to say that  Saving Private Ryan  is one of the best war films ever made, but it would be a bunk opinion because I haven't watched enough of the genre. I can certainly say that it's possibly my favorite thus far as well as an incredible drama. The acting is about as good as it gets, especially Tom Hanks, a legend of our time who tackles one of his best performances ever. That is high praise for a man with so many under his belt. The same excellence is delivered by Giovanni Ribisi, Tom Sizemore, and every single member of the supporting cast. A certain scene in which Ribisi is the focus almost brought me to tears and that is just one of numerous that are just as powerful. The camerawork is among the best that I have ever scene, even showcasing methods that would live on in influencing many films and video games to follow. It truly is beautiful regardless of the grim subject matter and serves as the best compliment to a powerful story envisioned by the writers and presented by the actors.  Saving Private Ryan  is a prime example of brilliant cinema, top notch cinematography and a chilling glimpse into history. A history in which I feel many take for granted nowadays. Happy Independence Day (4th of July) to all. I've reviewed 1,555 films to date but only nine got a five star rating. I'm glad to say that  Saving Private Ryan  is number ten. A funny thing about that is that two of those films star Tom Hanks. He truly is one of the greats of our time, and this is one of at least three masterpieces that he filled the lead role for with the others being  Forrest Gump  and  The Green Mile.  What a career!

Everything Guinness does in the second half feels wrong and I haven't been this disinterested in Holden ever - they are both actors I love, playing characters I hate. In addition to all this, it is pointlessly long - there is not enough character or plot to warrant almost 3 hours and the dialogue is painstakingly dull in places.That said, once the adventure starts kicking along in the final 30-40 minutes, the film becomes a pleasure to watch.

87219,"Trauma and loneliness go a special kind of hand in hand. Keeping people at a distance becomes easier then dealing with the actual pain that you're experiencing or have experienced. Coping with pain becomes more addicting then actually meaningfully facing it in any kind of real capacity. It feels good to retreat internally. Back into your own fantasy, media, other people, dramas, stories so you can relate but not have to actually cope with your own problems, traumas, etc. It feels good not to deal, and it takes a whole lot more to bring those problems back in and genuinely face them. And sometimes it's not about the right or the wrong, it's not about the specific trauma, but it's about facing a part of it in order to actually move on and move ahead in your life. It's about the pain but also complex catharsis of revisiting that trauma and familiar pain in ways.I really love this movie quite a lot and while I think it's a weirdly nice companion piece with something like The End of Evangelion. I think it's actually much more weirdly dreamlike and slightly comforting then End of Eva as a whole is.

If you read my previous reviews on the rebuild series, you can find that I really really wanted to love this movie so much, but it ended up disappointing for me. Yes, I know damn well that this rebuild series is an entirely separate entity on its own, it’s an anti-thesis made in contrast to the original series that holds less philosophical density as from its predecessor. I understand all that, I was mentally prepared and just expecting a fun ride, yet I still feel betrayed by it. The original Evangelion series along with the End of Evangelion is something that I hold very dear because they put a new light on my previous struggles and pushed me to change for the better. It was a life-changing experience and I’m still very much attached to them even now. Going into the rebuild series, I already presumed that they won’t ever reach the same psychological depth as the original series, and they don’t even have to be, this is Evangelion at its post-depression stage and I will enjoy it as it is. That was the case with the first 3 rebuilds series, I was able to enjoy them thoroughly especially for the 3.0 one. However, just for this film, I just couldn’t relate to what was happening here. The first half of the film is fantastic, brilliant even, it’s easily one of my favorite parts in the entire rebuild series. In my opinion, things only started to turn for the worse in the second half. The personas here, which were based on the original series, have morphed into someone that I didn’t want to recognize. They took the same character struggles from the series and attempted to resolve them in a half-assed manner. It’s heartbreaking to see the characters I adored so much being treated like this, like their struggles didn’t even matter and they just needed to perform correctly according to the plot. What's more, they also have to include soundtracks from End of Evangelion as well, which just begs for the viewers to draw comparisons between the two movies. And when the dust settles, this film just falls short in comparison to End of Evangelion for what it tries to do. It’s depressing to see this film trying to build itself over its predecessors which I love so much, it could’ve been much better if they didn’t make this choice.That being said, I still don’t hate this movie though. I saw many people commenting that rebuilds are pointless or cash grabs, and I strongly disagree with that. Yes, they might not be good, and original series is far superior. However, you can actually feel the passion and dedication that Anno has for this project. And also this has to be one of the most beautiful animated films I have ever see, every frame is carefully rendered with perfection, just to show how much effort they actually put into this film. It’s not mindless cash grabs nor it is pointless when they actually made these rebuilds with so much commitment and dedication. And overall I’m just happy that Anno is able to overcome his depression and actually moving on to do something that he always wanted. I really wished to be a part of the community that celebrates this historical moment with Anno, to send off Evangelion properly with love, with everyone, but this is not the end I desired. To me, the End of Evangelion is the only final destination, and I wouldn’t want it any other way. As mentally ill or stubborn as I might’ve sounded, I will continue to treasure and cheer for the entirety of Evangelion here at the End of Evangelion, always. Thank you and Bye-bye, all of Evangelion.",5,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time

I actually couldn't wait for it to finish. The characters aren't just unsympathetic, they're frankly not interesting. Joe Pesci plays 'gangster', Rutger Hauer plays 'self-centred knob', even Theresa Russell plays her least developed 'hyper-sexualised frustrated young woman'. Gene Hackman himself is just... himself. There's no sense of the film playing with his persona, as Roeg does so successfully with Jagger, Garfunkel, Christie and Bowie in his earlier films. There's also a seriously undeveloped and problematic fetishisation of the 'native' inhabitants that is never explored well enough to offer insight (as Roeg does so successfully in Walkabout) - leaving their depiction as little more than distasteful.

The violence is not graphic; it’s unhesitatingly scattered in a dramaturgical space that communicates the loneliness in which the characters find themselves in front of society and the harrowing nostalgia that remains of a long life on the verge of extinction, whose memories are attested by an old photo album or by the strained walls of the place where they live. The home thus becomes an island that takes them away from the rest.Amour is one of those unforgettable films that reminds us that for all the passage through life is short, the encounter with death is inevitable and therefore we must make the most of it, always remembering that the most influential experiences, in the end, will be those that have been built in our bond with others, carried out with the aspects of life that makes it worth living.",5,amour

25256,"Possibly the most overrated film on this here site. Painfully overlong, visually ugly wannabe profound cult arthouse fare, way too impressed with its own sense of transgressiveness. What does it have to offer? Countless up-skirt shots, repetitive erection jokes and a story arc in which our protagonist saves the damsel in distress first from hooligans, then from lesbianism and then from religious brainwashing. Complete with an extended sequence where he kidnaps and ties her up in a trailer to ""liberate"" her. You know, so that he  can show her how manipulated she is. Right.

45697,"No-one is more frustrated than me that I didn't gel with Werckmeister Harmonies, a committed and engaged work that I found myself pushing against at every juncture. That friction, in part, lies with Tarr's elevation of analogy above all else, a film that underlines its ideas with a rigor that denies them of any meaningful depth of thought or feeling. Such is the intensity of that insistence that the space that is usually so freeing in Tarr's filmography, equal parts challenging and meditative, instead becomes oddly hollow—a vacuum in which metaphors clang against one another. Everything that does work here—the long, unbroken shots that seem to drag into the infinite void, the cool whites and inky blacks of the photography, and the harsh gruffness that gives way to something strange, something ineffable—only serves to exacerbate that which doesn't even further, offering frequent reminders of Tarr's more elusive work. With Werckmeister Harmonies, every soaring emotional beat lands with a thudding simplicity (backed by a surprisingly leading score), and every cerebral aside tees up a pedestrian observation about systems of control. Call me a philistine, but this is a parable where only the largest images hit home.",3,werckmeister-harmonies

72264,"Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell strike again. Wildly celebrated for reasons (obviously) well beyond my mortal mind, A Matter of Life and Death is a great idea that goes to the dullest places. It’s as if Pressburger and Powell had gone out of their way to deflate their film of any dramatic propulsion. Case in point, their protagonist is asleep for nearly a THIRD of the film. I’d be too if I were stuck in a film this void of tension. It shouldn’t be, not when you’re Peter Carter (David Niven), British WW2 pilot on the brink of certain death, soothed in your dying moments by the dewy-eyed June (Kim Hunter), American radio operator. But when a logistical error from the afterlife gives Carter the opportunity to (literally) appeal for a second chance at life-- love, supposedly, blooms eternal. Except it doesn't, not when Carter and June have the chemistry of wet cardboard. They loudly proclaim their love for another but do nothing to show it. (Chess, seriously?) ‘Life and Death’ gets progressively worse (despite becoming more visually ambitious) when you realize that Carter makes a total of TWO decisions the entire film, and one of them is picking his lawyer. What starts out as a cold love story and shallow existential fantasy eventually erodes into a tedious courtroom drama of Western exceptionalism. Maybe I’m just too Asian to care about how the U.S and the U.K are such shining examples of diversity when the former is on the cusp of reelecting a racist and the latter voted to leave the Europe Union so the whole country can be racist on its own. But more importantly, what does this have to do with the movie? I’m not one to begrudge someone the films they love, just as I don't expect anyone to apologize for films they don't. And yet so many people still do.“Sorry, it’s not for me.”“I know I’m in the minority here.”“Sorry, it just didn't work for me.”But nah dawg, not me. I’m not apologizing for nothin’.

None of the characters interested me, and to be honest, I was pretty damn bored. But I will say that those battle sequences were impeccable, alongside the phenomenal cinematography and those vibrant and bold colours that were present from start to finish. Trust me, I would consider this a masterpiece as well if it was 2hrs 30mins of just those battle sequences, and those ultra wide shots with beautiful scenery.

78256,"Part of  my list of movies with the word MURDER in their titlesGreat courtroom theatrics, but is it a great story told well?In this movie we are supposed to believe that a rape victim's underwear was taken from the woods by the accused rapist and then thrown by the rapist himself into the communal laundry room of the rapist's own place of residence to be discovered by the women who always does the laundry and lives in the same building?  And this is taken as the highlight of this courtroom drama!Moreover, Jimmy Stewart's character doesn't seem to believe what the rape victim and her husband say on many occasions (and he doesn't seem to believe that they even love each other), but he takes their case. Why Stewart's character, in a state of burnout/semi-retirement takes on a murder case is not made apparent. He seems to take it because Jimmy Stewart's character wrote the book that this movie is based on. And despite high production values, this movie is needlessly drawn out for no reason. The extra runtime isn't used to add to the story, but is just mostly filler and even with such on-screen time the only characters portrayed well here were by Joseph N. Welch, Eve Arden and George C. Scott (i.e., none of the lead characters). Consequently, after this 2 hour and 40 minute film we still know almost nothing about the accused rapist, the victim (Lee Remick) and the victim's husband (Ben Gazzara). Oh, but there's great music in this! Yes, but if you saw a can of Pepsi-cola in 14 different scenes in a movie would that bother you in any way? What about if the director seemingly shot scenes just to suit such product placement? Duke Ellington was great and it's fine that he actually makes an appearance in this movie, but snippiets of his music are heard every few minutes over the first half of this drama.... and some scenes, like Stewart driving down a dusty road in a convertible or walking down a street seem to have been included just to provide a dialogue-less interval in which to highlight one of 13 or so different Ellington pieces of music. Stewart even plays piano with Ellington in one scene.Supposedly Lana Turner was offered and accepted the part played by Lee Remick, but that acceptance was vetoed when Turner made her acceptance contingent on wearing gowns designed by her personal designer. I think agreeing to that condition at least would have made the producers on this movie consistent since they did the same thing promoting Stewart and Ellington's music and the book's author.Oh, and if that isn't enough, the ending of this 2 hour and 40 minute movie is actually rushed! And concludes sort of with a joke leaving the viewer asking, what? How could so and so do that? Credits roll.5/10",3,anatomy-of-a-murder
82676,"Swing Girls: Swing, Swing and an unfortunate miss.Whilst it all culminates to a wonderful performance with high amounts of sentimental energy to accompany it, and with a synopsis that leads into a pretty intriguing first 30 minutes or so, Swing Girls ultimately fails on the basis of cohesion from my perspective. This derives from the fact that characters are rarely given any time to emotionally change their state of being, and even when so, the direction is horribly established, hence there being a lack of real tone. When you seperate these two from each other, you are led down a path of misconceptions pertaining to audience enrolment and their attempts at caring for the art displayed. It’s all shot and cut together in a way that makes it feel like scenes happening and ending for rather no reason. Theres build up nothing to pay off. You play instruments and leave; repeat. It’s high octane jazzy score does rarely anything to supplement the direction. To sound cool is well, cool and all, but I never felt a sense of gratification towards why they are playing. Not to mention the girls all seem like archetypes of each other - to begin with and to end with.

Wenders' post-Wings of Desire work has a strong kinship with Soderbergh in that he moves around registers as a dedicated engineer trying to solve a series of representation problems he set up for himself, only of course he does so while dealing with the far different realities of European co-productions. Perfect Days is this idea pushed to the extreme, and his effort shows. The nicest thing I can say is that there are at least moments when Wenders suggests he is very self-aware about its limitations. I love Koji Yakusho enough that watching his vitality get neutered throughout feels really sad.

12776,"When a film is unanimously praised by pretty much every critic who's ever put pen to paper, you tend to feel a little silly when you don't feel that same way. That's how I felt with Tokyo Story. There was a lot to like; especially the parts to do with Setsuko Hara's daughter-in-law. But this is a film that was two years ago rated as the best film of all time by other directors in Sight and Sound. So why don't I feel the same way?What I've come up with is a combination of culture, age, expectation and taste. I've always found the Japanese culture hard to relate to, and whilst this film deals with universal issues of loss, disappointment and ageing, the culture is still a key ingredient. On top that it's Japanese culture from 1953, so even harder to associate with. I find the way the characters relate to each other cold and sterile, with again Hara's character being an exception. Any underlying tension and emotion is always kept at arms' length from me.Expectation is obviously a factor too. If everyone loves this film than of course I'll love it too? Tempered expectations may have produced a more rewarding viewing experience but I was really just left wanting more.",5,tokyo-story

76861,"Stephen King’s novel The Green Mile is simultaneously deeply racist and very revealing, perhaps the defining example I can point to of a story as a manifestation of white guilt. John Coffey is not so much a character as a metaphor King applies to how white and black people interact; one perpetually charged with violence against a dehumanized Other, the latter being nonetheless charged with helping whiteness whenever possible. It’s frankly a pretty revolting worldview, and demonstrates the limits of King’s imagination. He can write a black man capable of miracles, but can’t imagine a black man that could claim his freedom (which he is even textually entitled to). But King doesn’t stop there! He still has to let John Coffey absolve the prison guards of their sin, telling them that it’s fine so that the narrative can circumvent the fact that they are enacting an innocent man’s death. The protagonist’s punishment is, hilariously, an abnormally long life, because feeling bad for inaction is somehow equivalent. It’s deranged!!Darabont’s film is largely a 1 to 1 adaptation, although its handful of artistic choices are notable because they somehow make an awful narrative even worse. There’s the opening gag of John Coffey being too big for the frame of the film; Coffey’s “monstrous” (the book/film’s words!) stature is basically the subject of a comedy bit. Darabont’s camera seemingly never stops finding ways to salaciously mine Michael Clarke Duncan’s various expressions for maximum saccharine melodrama, and the incessant score doesn’t help matters here. An even wilder emphasis is given to how Coffey cures Tom Hanks’s sexual dysfunction and boosts his performance, a detail the book glances over and this pounds in multiple times…this makes what I said in the first paragraph feel even more nauseating. The worst change is saved for the end though, where Coffey gets to watch a movie and cries, exclaiming that the actors onscreen are “like angels.” It’s a film tradition at this point to jerk off the medium’s worth within a narrative, but to add it into here feels totally out of the blue and serves nothing. There was no saving any of this to begin with though. The Green Mile ends, but boy is it fucking long.",0,the-green-mile

68794,"June, 1990. A man and his young son travel deep into rural Iran towards the aftermath of the Manjil-Rudbar earthquake.The purpose of their journey isn't immediately apparent. But when it's revealed that the man is searching for the young actor who starred in Abbas Kiarostami's own Where is the Friend's House? (1987), the story quickly transcends the conventional arthouse roadtrip. Life, and Nothing More isn't simply a story of a man searching for a boy. It's the story of Kiarostami himself, mirroring his own journey to find his young actor. In a single masterstroke, Kiarostami not just breaks the fourth wall, he blends it right into the celluloid. Other films have opted for more brutish methods. Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) rips through the very film reel it’s printed on. Charlie Kaufman’s Being John Malcovich (1999), uses a real world Hollywood star to disrupt the concept of personal identity. Countless other examples are intentionally jarring. That's why it’s called “breaking” the fourth wall. But what Kiarostami does in ‘Life' is more subtle, more poetic. He doesn't collide the worlds of cinema and reality as much as he massages the two together. One is simply an extension of the other. As I watch ‘Life’ unfold, I’m not pulled into the movie. I’m already in it. I'm reminded that I exist in the same world as the tragic Iranian earthquake that took the lives of as many as 50,000 people. The missing boy is a living, breathing, individual who exists alongside me. Alongside you. For Kiarostami, cinema is not some far-off land exclusive to the realm of make-believe. It lives and breathes in the here and now, among the people, in our communities, in our souls. I am a Southeast Asian native who is, for a moment in time, profoundly connected to the people of Iran.

55378,"The Criterion Restoration for this film looks incredible. The technical aspects of this film are fantastic, and it's very visually engaging. But straight up, this is such a disappointment. I wish I had more to say about the film as a narrative, but I was pretty bored by the midway point. I don't know... I genuinely expected to love this.It's split into different segments, and it feels really scattered because of this. The different stories don't really relate to each other that much, although there are a few recurring characters. Kinda reminded me of Vivre sa Vie, which I, unfortunately, did not like that much either.There are definitely certain sections that I really enjoyed. The sequence with the actress is obviously a highlight, and that fountain scene is ICONIC. I was really digging the last ""episode"" of the film as well, but most of the sections in the second half of the film were kind of lacking. The party scene where the woman does the striptease felt disjointed and messy, and I found myself losing focus a lot during that segment.I'm sad I didn't love this on first watch, but maybe this film will grow on me. Planning on watching four other Fellini films over the course of the next month, and I'm hoping those will fare better.Note to Criterion: please provide subtitles for the English-speaking parts as well, it's really annoying when someone speaks English and suddenly there are no more subtitles.

77866,"This is a rare and special achievement; a film that deals with the subject of abortion in a subtle manner. It manages to link the struggles that women face to a wider social context and display all the factors that cause women to want to terminate a pregnancy. It ends up feeling more like a story about life in Ceaușescu’s Romania, than a fable about abortion. This represents progress, as films about this subject can now consider female characters as complex human beings who face many struggles in their day to day life, rather than being infantilised baby makers who silently watch on as other characters debate over the decisions they are making. Gâbita is not the main character but, in just a couple of scenes, we come to understand her unique fears and personality quirks. She does have to go through the wringer and, in seeing her spirit crushed, we realise that there was no way to achieve true happiness in Communist Romania. Otilia, Anamaria Marinca, is a bright university student who chooses to help her roommate Gâbita, Laura Vasiliu, get an abortion. This proves to be difficult because they live in Communist Romania and cannot legally obtain treatment. Otilia must figure out a way to successfully schedule the procedure and pay the abortionist, Vlad Ivanov. She is horrified when she learns that he expects them to provide him with sexual favours if he is to go through with performing the procedure. They both end up having sex with them and he places a probe into Gâbita’s vagina. Otilia must leave in order to meet up with her boyfriend Adi, Alexandru Potocean, and attend his mother’s party. It is obvious that their relationship is breaking down and they have lost the ability to trust one another. They try to get through the night and talk about some of the issues that Gâbita is facing. She ends up leaving the party and returning to Gâbita. The two women discuss the abortion and Otilia tells her friend that they should try to put the event behind them. She feels as though it is important for them to try to let go of any trauma they experienced. Director Cristian Mungiu seems to be preoccupied with the complicated relationship that Romanians had with the political system that governed their country. There is a revealing moment in a scene set a party held by Adi’s mother, in which several members of a more conservative older generation debate the merits of compulsory military service. We see a coarse, ill mannered man complaining about the fact that members of the younger generation don’t seem to have the same sense of duty that he and his peers had. Surprisingly, one of the women at the party decides to debate him and insists that it is not fair to force young men to put their lives on the line. We quickly notice the fact that Otilia and Adi do not interject while this man rants and raves and everybody becomes visibly uncomfortable whenever people touch on politics. This is true of parties in first world nations where there are democratically elected leaders, but I’ve never attended a social gathering where everybody felt the need to go silent when somebody began to criticise anti-blasphemy laws or Judith Collins. Mungiu wants to highlight the fact that Ceaușescu succeeded in creating an atmosphere of fear. He wanted people to be afraid of speaking out on controversial issues or attacking government policies. He did this, in part, by creating divisions between different generations and making people feel as though having an argument over political issues was almost impossible. The ending also hammers home the point that these women are living in a society where they have no real freedom. We have just seen them risking everything to stay above water and this has brought them back to a point where they are still on the brink of losing everything. They are both left to ponder what lies ahead and the emptiness in their gazes suggests that they aren’t anticipating happy futures. Imagine the final shot of The Graduate (1967), if you actually cared about the people who were blankly staring off into the distance.",8,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days

Second, I won't be discussing the specific politics of the film in this review because I do not have a general thesis on what I think about how the film handled different topics, and I don't want to ramble. If anyone wants to discuss in the comments, I'd love to.)I was so impressed by the acting in this film. We all know how much I adore Montgomery Clift, and seeing him in this film was another wonderful glimpse into his depths of talent. He's only in the film for all of 15 minutes (not even a tenth of the film's 3 hour runtime) but he makes an impression that lasts until the final moments. The pain and anger he conveys in his short scene echoes. Richard Widmark was also incredible as the prosecutor. I'm shocked he did not receive an Oscar nomination. I watched him this summer in Broken Lance as a villain, and found him excellent there, and now as a gallant military man I found him just as compelling. I might begin to consider him a new favorite actor soon.I've singled out these two performances specifically, but the film is filled with wonderful acting. Judy Garland is wonderful in a role against type, Marlene Dietrich has her usual confidence in a subtle seductress part, Spencer Tracy's talent effortlessly carries the film, and Maximilian Schell adds depths to his contradictory defendant.

And as a father with a son who falls within the Asperger's spectrum, the depiction of Max's character seems far too pat and predictable for comfort.Still the platonic love affair between Mary and Max feels mostly genuine and all the little details of suburban Australian and urban New York City life make it impossible to totally ignore this as a true classic.In the end, I had to rate it halfway between zero and five stars, simply because it kept alternatively pegging the Bullshit-O-Meter and registering nothing on the scale.",4,mary-and-max

39656,"An abstract, self indulgent and self critical cinematic explosion. Fosse is in full control of being out of control, mirroring the internal conflict with outward expression. This is a great film about how life becomes performance, and how performance becomes life. Roy Scheider gives it his all in a performance that is legally not Bob Fosse. The film’s construction, as alluded to, matches his character with every inch pushing excess while reflecting back on itself. We have countless clever juxtapositions and stylisations that explore the character and his relationship with the world: he has to go out with a literal song and dance song; death - there from the start - is personified as a glamorous woman (an obscure object of desire) that interviews him backstage; his chest being opened for heart surgery is paired with his show being cut apart (metaphorically) by financiers and the like. We also have a film review reviewing the film in the film that also serves as a self aware review of the film itself.This knowingness does fall over into over stylisation at points but then the excess is so core to the picture that it couldn’t be any other way. It is all staged with frantic energy and endless imagination that keeps a foot in fantasy and foot in reality, allowing it to channel both at once.You fully believe that his life is show business and performance, and you fully believe this has made him and marred him. It is a spiralling tragedy foreshadowed from the very beginning. It is delightfully unsubtle and utterly theatrical, yet still nuanced and intelligent. Every part is earned and legitimate, and fabulous. There are jarringly dated moments but, for the most part, this still feels timeless.",7,all-that-jazz

From what I read they used real ammunition throughout the entire movie, which really added to the grounded perspective the film has.All of the performances are fantastic in this. Apparently Aleksey Kravchenko was put through hell during the production of this movie, in my eyes I felt he captured this performance extremely well. There isn't much of a character there for him, he's more a vessel and a ground point to just see the horrors of this movie unfold. I feel that works a lot better than having a traditional narrative and really gets you more invested in the events. This film was fantastic. To those of you who haven't watched this movie I highly recommend it. As long as you're okay with movies showing you things that will make you uncomfortable then I'm sure you'll really find something in this movie. It's incredibly dark and it's definitely a movie that you need to see at least once.",9,come-and-see

44665,"Satyajit Ray’s celebrated debut is a remarkably complete film considering it features mostly amateurs in front of the camera and novices behind it. It was shot on a shoestring budget and was able to be made in part because of the inspiration provided by Jean Renoir while he was shooting The River in India, and then completed because of the interventions John Huston and others in helping find the money to complete it. But it is all Ray, as he channels the Italian neo-realist pictures he greatly admired to turn his lens, with bracing clarity, on the world of young Apu’s family, struggling to survive in the face of poverty. It is pointed in its social commentary, which is impressive enough, but what really elevates it is how well it captures the preoccupations of its three different generations, with naturalistic energy and subtle poetry. The adult world of work and struggle is set against the playful and imaginative world of Apu and his sister, Durga. Apu’s energy is infectious. He’s a young boy, spring-loaded with a zest for life. Their great Auntie Indir is gnarled and weathered like an ancient tree, and like the children is full of spirited mischief, though no longer fleet of foot. She watches over the children with a lifetime’s affection. Caught in the middle are the children’s parents who have fallen on hard times and face mounting debts which have meant the loss of their sustaining orchard. The children’s father, Harihar, is trying to increase his prospects by succeeding as an author, but his struggles with this and his constant travel is placing an additional burden on the family, most of which is borne by their long-suffering mother Sarbojaya.The focus on the very different struggles of the three female characters reminds me of Mizoguchi’s films that were being made around the same time on the opposite side of the continent. While Sarbojaya toils, Indir exists only on the kindness and tolerance of others, and Durga tries to rebel against the crushing expectation of a life of disadvantage and servitude. Juxtaposed with this is Apu’s light-heartedness and Harihar’s self-obsessed ambition. The men seem relatively untouched by the weight of existence carried by their women. Until that is, as it is in Mizoguchi’s films, tragedy strikes the family. One of the many qualities of Pather Panchali is the score by Ravi Shankar, written while he was still early in his career. Ray was fortunate to find a musician grounded in Indian classical traditions striving for new expression. And Shankar delivered a terrifically fluid score that is never extraneous, sentimental or contrived. Instead it felicitously helps paint the film with a subtle and profound ear for its emotional landscapes. It is very different to most Western scores in this regard and all the better for it.Best Films of the 1950s | Best Music (Scores and Soundtracks)",7,pather-panchali

88963,"In Search of 5 Stars - The September Project""Welcome to the family.""I've been doing a fair bit of reading around about Mike Leigh as a result of watching two of his films for this project and it's quite interesting, as well as odd, to me that the only repeated criticism I can see of his work is regarding the dialogue in his films. One critic even described it as ""inauthentic"".I'm not somebody who desperately craves dialogue in films to sound natural. There are clearly many types and genres of films where that should not be a priority and there are also many examples where such dialogue could actually be detracting to the finished product. I'm a huge fan of David Mamet, for instance, and I doubt anyone would classify the spoken word he puts in his work as sounding natural.Related to Leigh though, it's both a damning criticism and, in my eyes, completely wrong. Many of his films are very reliant on discourse that sounds completely genuine, and that's absolutely the case with Secrets & Lies. It just makes you wonder if such critics have ever actually heard real people talk or whether they've just spent too much time watching films and lost the ear for a realistic conversation.The way everyone talks to each other in Secrets & Lies was very familiar to me from my own life, for better or worse. The quick way a seemingly docile discussion can become a blazing row with slamming doors is something I'm sure many can recognise as well, and it's something that Leigh also seems to have a connection with. I loved the way everybody conversed with each other here because there was an authenticity to it all that this particular film needed.The everyday twang to it all relates well to an extended family that has all manner of one-on-one relationships that again I'm sure many can relate to. The barbecue near the end, where everything inevitably comes to a head, is not just great because of all the revelations that ensue, but because you can compare and contrast just how everyone is relating to one another.I could barely watch it, personally, but only because my anxieties kicked in and not because there was anything wrong with it. It was probably just a bit too raw and accurate for me to ever feel comfortable but I doubt very much anyone should feel that way here anyway. In fact, you should rarely feel that way in Secrets & Lies. It's necessarily frank and, perhaps ironically given its title, brutally honest.Everyone here has their major faults but nobody is a bad person. These are all people who have legitimate and excusable reasons for the flaws in their personalities and behaviour, and they're usually there because they are trying to prevent those around them from being like them or making the same mistakes they did. Brenda Blethyn's antagonism of her daughter, Claire Rushbrook, is an overreaction born out of desperation in not wanting her daughter to tread the same path she did.Few films I've ever seen have been able to explore these familial issues with the maturity and believability shown here. Leigh dispenses with the usual notions of 'good' and 'bad' people, instead working off a theory that most people are essentially the same at their core but driven to places by their own bad experiences they really do not want to exist in.Leigh also manages to tackle the subject of racism quietly and maturely, with Marianne Jean-Baptiste's colour referred to on only a handful of occasions. Phyllis Logan's expression and demeanour around her when she turns up at the barbecue says way, way more than most films that tackle the subject head-on manage to say. There really is almost nothing that Secrets & Lies takes on and misses the target with.The only small fault here is Elizabeth Berrington's reaction to it all kicking off near the end, a bit of a corny note although it did at least stay fairly relevant to her character. Otherwise, Secrets & Lies is everything you've heard it is and a lot more besides.",8,secrets-lies

26598,"Satantango is a pure work of the devil which captures arrogant bleakness of a rural province in the most unorthodox way.Firstly, I will deem the film to be a psychological piece as it demands utmost concentration of the viewer through it's entire 7 hour runtime which as a result takes quite a mental toll.The film is comprised of an absolute empathetic void as it offers nothing but harsh bleakness. Opening with a humongous 10 minutes opening sequence with stray animals and cattle loitering around, it gives an exquisitely composed dystopian feeling; which of course is the same for rest of the film.People accustomed with Béla Tarr's films know his staggeringly paced and long staring shots into oblivion.The whole film is an exploration into the psyche or rather the 'negative psyche' of the Hungarian people at a loss of jobs, lack of welfare and emotional warmth & hardships.The dark, gloomy apocalyptic allegory irks & itches the mental peace whereas the beautifully textured sordid close-ups and cinematography soothes you which is a presentation of the genius that Tarr is.The gloominess is not only portrayed through the characters in it but also in the from of the vivid and blatant landscapes of the place which emits a coldness from it for an ample amount of the focus of the film is on it, connecting the place and it's characters.The entirety of it's actions lets us see the couples and a doctor, each of them existing with no dire hope and is striving to escape the seeming hell. It is the characters who make the air in the film filled with betrayal and cruelty.An ironically soothing devilish existence of a place filled with perplexed people which has been beautifully composed and carried out with a great cinematic achievement.100/100",9,satantango

It’s superbly director by Carol Reed who infuses the movie with murky clockwork-like juxtapositions and movements which take advantage of Graham Greene’s screenplay, along with aggressive inflexions around its characters.The narrative finds each of its figures insulated and exploited until the mood amounts to an uncomfortable panorama of estrangement where people are frequently spiralling and departing into their misplaced worlds.

36757,"This film has been on my watchlist for so long, and I as a romance lover have never seen this colossal film before is a shame. ""Before Sunrise"" is simply a timeless masterpiece that shows effortlessly, romance, philosophy, and the magic of the connection of the first encounters. Directed by Richard Linklater and released in 1995, this film is a testimony to the power of human connection and the beauty of living in the present moment.The story unfolds over a single night in Vienna, where Jesse (Ethan Hawke), an American traveler, and Céline (Julie Delpy), a French student, meet by chance on a train. Their initial meeting triggers an immediate and deep connection, leading them to disembark in Vienna and spend the night exploring the city together before Jesse's morning flight.I can say for sure that the strength of the film lies in its simplicity. With minimalist dialogue and a focus on intimate conversations, ""Before Sunrise"" captures the essence of two souls connecting on such a deep level. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy offer exceptional performances that are authentic, vulnerable, and full of nuances. They effortlessly portray the complexities of young love, mixing charm, wit, and a touch of melancholy.Director Linklater brilliantly creates a sense of spontaneity and authenticity, making me feel like I'm witnessing a genuine encounter between two strangers. The film's real-time progression increases the immersive experience, allowing anyone who watches to join Jesse and Céline on their enchanting journey through the streets of Vienna.One of the most notable aspects of ""Before Sunrise"" is its ability to capture the intellectual and philosophical conversations that arise between Jesse and Céline. They explore a range of topics, including love, life, death, and the nature of human existence. These conversations are thought-provoking, profound, and extremely realistic, making many people reflect on their own perspectives and beliefs.The cinematography of the film is breathtaking. The picturesque streets of Vienna serve as a background for the flourishing romance, enhancing the romantic atmosphere of the film. The work of the camera beautifully captures the subtleties of the characters' expressions and gestures, allowing the audience to connect deeply with their emotions.The soundtrack of ""Before Sunrise"" is a delicious addition to the movie. Full of dreamy melodies and evocative lyrics, you can analyze the change of each song through each change of space that the characters make, whether in a vinyl store, to a rock bar. In general, the music adds an extra layer of emotion, totally elevating the romantic atmosphere of the film.""Before Sunrise"" is not just a love story; it is a celebration of the specific moments that shape our lives. This encourages us to value the present, to connect with others on a deep level, to embrace the fortuitous encounters that can change our perspectives forever, and try to fight with this constant anxiety that many have to connect and get closer to the unknown, our world needs love.In conclusion, ""Before Sunrise"" is a cinematic jewel, it is a raw and realistic romance film, and it is an exploration of the purest reality. With its remarkable performances, engaging dialogues, and charming portrait of love, it is a film that transcends time and leaves a permanent mark on those who have already watched it. A true masterpiece and by far one of the best romances I've ever seen, it's unique it's so real and so full of art, it's a real romance film.⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀ ⠀— thanks for reading & for all the support <3— obrigado por ler & por todo carinho <3",8,before-sunrise

39722,"“All That Jazz” is a fever dream of a movie and a captivating as well as exhilarating experience. It can be seen as a spiritual relative of Fellini´s “8 ½”, since both movies are semi-autobiographical fantastic character studies that explore the director´s relationship with his art, women, and mortality. In this case, the director in question is Bob Fosse and not Federico Fellini, and while I think that “8 ½” is a finer work of art, “All That Jazz” is clearly the flashier, wilder, and crazier film. Some aspects of it also remind me of Charlie Kaufman´s “Synecdoche, New York”.The movie is a grand and stylish spectacle. The mise-en-scène is vibrant, detailed, and stunning, the camerawork is masterful, and the musical numbers are breathtaking, memorable, and impressively choreographed. But my favorite aspect has to be the stream of consciousness editing style, which really makes you feel like you are inside the mind of a madman.This madman is called Joe Gideon (the stand-in for Fosse), an eccentric and flamboyant theater director, who is perfectly portrayed by Roy Scheider. I mainly associate Scheider with his role as Chief Brody from “Jaws”, so this really showed me his range. He truly delivers a tour de force performance full of energy and charisma and he carries the movie with ease. Gideon is a depraved, egomaniacal, and just all around deeply flawed character and you just have to respect Fosse´s raw, honest, and unflinching self-examination as an artist and human being.  You witness him (as Gideon) abusing his body and mind in various ways and pushing himself past his limits in an overly ambitious, obsessive, and self-destructive search for artistic perfection and meaning. The film could be seen as a self-critique and satire of showbusiness, but to me, it doesn´t really feel like Fosse is apologizing for his behavior. He doesn´t celebrate it either. It feels more like he is coming to terms with who he is and reflects on it in an honest, artistically creative, and morally neutral way. Furthermore, “All That Jazz” explores death and people´s denial, fear, and acceptance of it in a fascinating way I haven´t seen before.I have to say that during the first half, it were mainly the musical numbers that blew me away, especially the legendary opening audition sequence, whereas the drama didn´t fully click with me emotionally (Joe Gideon´s life, personality, and problems are just very different from mine), but as soon as Gideon was in the hospital, the theme of mortality became the main focus, and the dreamlike absurd surrealism was turned up to 11 , I completely fell in love with “All That Jazz”. And that ending number as well as the final cut are just pure perfection. Yeah, the film is self-indulgent as hell but also mesmerizing and fun to watch.After seeing it for the first time, I´m not yet ready to call “All That Jazz” one of my all-time favorite movies (which a 4.5 or 5 star rating implies to me), but it´s definitely a bold, exciting, and impactful piece of art and comes highly recommended.",7,all-that-jazz

11374,"Dune: Part Two is endowed with a certain quality of fascination, but it is an extraordinary quality of a compelling failure. To elaborate on this fascination requires an elaboration on the constituent elements of the aesthetic and dramatic architecture it has cultivated.The first is the melodrama framework, including its technical and symbolic development. Melodrama, of course, derives from the Greek word ""melos,"" music, and the French word ""drame,"" drama. Melodrama need not be restricted to its formal dictionary definitions of a sensationalized dramatic piece with a penchant for violent appeals to emotion, though such melodramatic aestheticization can be a welcome mode of artistry, as it is one of the bravest forms of expression. Regardless, if one were to summarize its primary function, it is simply drama with music. The fascination with melodrama, therefore, comes from the bold musicality of its aesthetic and dramatic languages, especially when the languages utilized communicate a tragedy.The second is the ultimate interest of science fiction, of speculative fiction. Particular attention, of course, may be placed on an approximation to scientific accuracy and predictions as a means to exercise one's imagination beyond the immediate, real-life experiences of contemporaneous knowledge and scientific limitations. If the purpose of science is to undergo rigorous, systematic, and experimental endeavors that build and organize an extended understanding of the world and its historical and future development, then science fiction appears to fulfill a similar or, at least, complementary function. Such endeavors, thus, require a world to continually exist; such experimentations or, rather, speculations are conducted by those who wish to avoid a world's nonexistence with further scientific advancements and further scientific predictions, even if the aforementioned advancements and predictions are made to preserve the existence of a world by rendering others into nonexistence. In other words, science fiction is less about science and more about the anticipation of destruction, a tragedy of inexhaustible invitations to further speculation, even fascination.If the aesthetic and dramatic architecture of Dune is a profound overlap between the musical communication of a melodrama's tragedy and science fiction's anticipation of destruction, one must wonder about the central conflict to which such overlap aims to identify as the most tragic and destructive and, therefore, fascinating. Such deliberation requires an understanding--reluctant or otherwise--that there exist cultures of spectacles that have been inundated by creations of or built on tragedy or destruction, as a concern with the aesthetics of tragedy or destruction is one of the oldest subjects of art. Part of the motivation behind the cultivation of such cultures is the desire to have spectacular realities and experiences, no matter their tragicness or destructiveness, confirmed and enhanced by spectacular creations informed by tragedy or destruction.Melodrama and science fiction remain some of the most durable works in cinema because they are some of the purest forms of spectacle. The most notable distinction between their forms is that melodrama's formal arrangement of a spectacle transmits from the invisible interior to the visible exterior, whereas that of science fiction transmits from the invisible exterior to the visible interior. An interplay between perceptible and imperceptible elements of tragedy and destruction can exist when melodrama or science fiction, as speculative fiction, emulates the technical and symbolic language of the other. Hence, the aesthetic and dramatic architecture of Dune imbricates the two, rendering tragedy a destruction and destruction a tragedy, whether perceptible or imperceptible.Given the special significance of the mobilization of languages, the spectacularization of suffering, the imbrication of tragedy and destruction, and the perceptibility of the two, even those with a minimum of initiation with Frank Herbert's source novel(s) will understand that the most enduring fascination with Dune, purportedly, is the central tragedies and destructions pertaining to the politics of humanity and the operation of power. Paul's ascension and the ""jihad"" he unleashes occupy the dramatic positions of the spectacularized tragedy and destruction; the former is transmitted melodramatically, the latter speculatively.It is peculiar, then, that the films reconfigure the Fremen mythology by removing any mention of the novel's ""jihad"" and replacing it with the more palatable label of the Muad'Dib's ""holy war."" The peculiarity embodies the fact that its aesthetic and dramatic architecture further germinates the stylistic seeds of Orientalist semantics and semiotics but within a more controlled experimental environment. Of course, particular disciplines are necessary to engage in any serious mode of artistry. But the linguistic invisibility of a ""jihad"" and the cinematic visibility of a ""holy war"" makes it even more apparent that the directorial control of its images and sound is oriented towards an application that isn't built for extending one's understanding of the world nor its historical and future development but, instead, calculated for anticipating the spectatorial response to a cinematic rendition of destruction. If filmmaking can be interpreted as a science, then the rigorous, systematic, and experimental endeavors undertaken for Dune's production serve to approximate the most consumable and convenient spectacles, much of which are informed by Orientalist semantics and semiotics.Indeed, the reliance on the measure of how consumable or convenient a spectacle is can indicate the general practice of commercial filmmaking as a series of decisions where certain features are essentialized or eliminated, but for commercial films that also aim for prestige recognition, the matter of how sophisticated a spectacle is in terms of its consumable qualities and convenience in representation enters the realm of critical consideration. Herbert's novelistic creations may have elaborated on his libertarian distrust of government, especially those led by charismatic authorities, and although his creations possess fundamental flaws shared by the general inadequacies of a libertarian interpretation or application of power, the density of their lore-building suggests that Herbert's speculations were built around the curiosity of politics and power, even if such curiosity is grossly and fetishistically limited by the Orientalist reimagination of foreign cultures and geopolitical conflicts. Villeneuve, however, only applies an engineer's perspective on ethnographic descriptions of homogenized Orientalism, utilizing a curious yet equally fetishistic lens to the superficial pleasures of encountering the Other, oftentimes essentializing the most consumable qualities of Otherness and exoticism while eliminating particular semantics and semiotics indicative of the troubling implications of consuming them, but not enough to erase the purported pleasures from such Orientalist consumption. If one were to be generous and consider this a serious mode of artistry, then it is one of caution and cowardice, noncommittal to the greater intricacies or implications of language as an instrument of empire.The purported pleasures of Orientalist consumption can be better understood if one were to recognize that the film's dramaturgical structure ensures that, although occasionally facing some level of resistance, Paul never encounters any real obstacle or barrier in embracing Fremen culture or, at least, there was never any doubt he'd be respected beyond an equal, a messianic leader who successfully inspires and, thus, legitimizes his Fremen subordinates with their liberation struggles. Even then, if one were to perceive Paul's self-augmentation as one that rewards his assimilation into marginalized cultures--one that grants him greater access to the potentialities of the marginalized to which they remain largely inaccessible--then a key pleasure of Orientalist consumption is in surpassing the Other's own affinity to their cultures. Not only is Paul able to survive the Water of Life, a deadly poison that is fatal to men and the untrained, but also reawakened with greater access, clarity, and understanding of his prescience ability. Such augmentation enables Paul to convince the Fremen to accept not only his role as a messiah but also successfully challenge and denounce the ancient ritual of gaining leadership that the Fremen practice. The Fremen, then, are only ever utilized as witnesses and participants of Paul's ascendant exceptionalism. Of course, the film provides a melodramatic aestheticization that primes for an excessive engagement with Paul's development as a messianic tragic figure, and although the dramatic trajectory charts an Oedipal destination critical of messianic mythologies, it is nevertheless peculiar that the film situates the imagery of the ""holy war"" as an unstoppable destruction Paul has unleashed, reaffirming and reconfirming the colonial myths about the hostile Other and their incapability to build their own future, never thoroughly speculating or anticipating the aesthetic language where those assigned Other foster the self-determination necessary to liberate themselves from colonial violence. Hence, Dune's failure as a speculative melodrama is not just its profound mischaracterization of an Other as an unstoppable, hostile threat to the world's continual existence, or even the ascendant exceptionalism preceding the consumption of the Other, but also its fabrication of the Other's cultural melody: false music intended to further confirm and enhance the colonial myths that anticipate the purported destruction it threatens, one in which the manner of its instrumentation approximates the most consumable and convenient and, therefore, the safest interpretations of Orientalist semantics and semiotics in relation to its cautious exploration of power.",1,dune-part-two

And so I started it, and five minutes in I let out a “fuck.” Because I knew immediately that I was going to end up giving it a positive score. Now I have to eat my words. I’ll say that I still don’t think Charlie Chaplin is compelling at what he’s most known for, his physical comedy. That and the idea of using Adolf Hitler imagery for lighthearted hyucks in the middle of World War II doesn’t totally sit right with me. But I’m sorry, this movie is just great, and given the finale I definitely feel like it’s coming from a good place. Charlie Chaplin, as it turns out, is significantly better comedic line readings than he is at slapstick, and his talents definitely propel The Great Dictator further forward than it otherwise would have been.

57754,"#20 of 100 in my Top 100 Directors ChallengeAlthough I could appreciate many merits of this film about a marriage in decline by writer-director Michelangelo Antonioni, I didn't really enjoy it. Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau give restrained, passionless performances as husband and wife Giovanni and Lidia Pontano, as they navigate an eventful evening and one long night in Milan. There's certainly the same controlled boredom here that I found interesting in ""L'Avventura"" (1960), but it wasn't working for me this time. The couple's time together takes them first to a hospital to visit their terminally ill friend Tommaso Garani (Bernhard Wicki) before attending a book launch for Giovanni's newly published novel. There's a stop at home to change into evening wear, a visit to a nightclub where a contortionist performs an act with a wine glass, and then a late arrival at the massive estate of industrialist Mr. Gherardini (Vincenzo Corbella) and his wife (Gitt Magrini), who are throwing a celebration for their new race horse.Throughout the various stops in this journey, the Pontanos are quite separate in their attentions, cordial to each other, but not close. Giovanni is clearly attracted to other women, and Lidia takes some interest in other men. But it is the Gherardini's bored and beautiful daughter Valentina (Monica Vitti) who arouses the most interest in them after a sudden rain storm and a power outage shifts the mood of the party to greater intimacy.Perhaps if I had been in a melancholy mood when I watched this, I might have felt more attune to its emotional nuances. Nevertheless, the film won Antonioni the Golden Berlin Bear, and he also received Best Director prizes from both the David di Donatello Awards and the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists. Perhaps I'll watch it again someday and like it better.",6,la-notte

43891,"I've not read Tolstoy's novel, so I can't speak to claims that this film vastly simplifies and reduces its source material, but even so I can tell that it did little to bring War and Peace to life. This was a fairly bland movie that, despite its long running time, lacks the sense of epic grandeur that it is obviously striving to achieve. This adaptation was written by six screenwriters, and it feels that way. The result is a muddled patchwork that not even Audrey Hepburn could revive (though she's so damned charming that her scenes were probably my favorites).Lists: 1956 Films | Long Ones",4,war-and-peace
35971,"Yasujirō Ozu's subtle yet multifaceted cinematic style captures simple family stories in Japan like no other, and in the quietly mournful ""Late Spring,"" a father and daughter bond is sketched with beauty. Themes concerning the rightness of marriage in terms of age and the divide between tradition and modernity provide nuance to the drama. The exceptional writing tells so many lessons about love, life, and sacrifice. Captured through Ozu's pristine still camerawork, the film shows how a daughter reconciles her inner struggle whether to continue taking care of her widowed father, which gives her so much joy, or to marry someone, as she is pressured to do so given her age. Jealousy is also an underlying theme, as illustrated in a pivotal Noh theatre sequence that is both haunting and insightful. Ultimately, ""Late Spring"" is about letting go of something to gain another. The characters, especially Noriko and Shukichi, are so well-rendered. Setsuko Hara and Chishu Ryu deserve to be regarded worldwide as acting icons. I was not deeply affected by the film as much as I could have been, but the performances, messages, and visual style are spotless.",7,late-spring

50701,"Fuck. This. Movie.Which is I say in spite of all that it has going for it. The director, cinematography, cast, production design, all work their asses off to make what is essentially an above average psychological thriller about two kidnapped girls.So why is this movie such an abhorrent piece of shit? It comes down to the way it treats its main character, Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman), whose daughter is one of the two kidnapped girls and is compelled to take matters into his own hands. Frist off, Keller is a bit of survivalist. In the opening scene, he teaches his son to hunt deer, which is less a father-son bonding moment and actually a lesson in how to survive in case there's a breakdown in society.  Keller also maintains a  well stocked basement full of food and supplies. In a lot of ways, this always-be-prepared mentality doesn't play a huge part in the plot (even though I was on edge ready for the kids to be found dead, as a sort of horrific and ironic accident, in a basement fridge), except for when his wife says to him after several sleepless days, ""You made me feel so safe. You told us that you could protect us from everything."" With his big strong man pride now hurt, Keller kidnaps Alex Jones, a guy with a 10 point IQ (Paul Dano) who the police suspect but remove from their suspect list but who Keller is whole-heartedly convinced must have taken his kid. As flimsy as his reasons are for kidnapping someone at gunpoint, I think we're all still pretty sympathetic to Keller's state of mind at this point. The kid seems mentally incapable of committing any crimes let alone kidnapping, and the cops reach this conclusion as well, but it's understandable that a scared father would want to do anything to get his daughter back and maybe pick the absolute worst thing to make that happen.But then the beatings start. Keller absolutely pummels Alex for days. Keller has limits, though, and stops himself from using a hammer on Alex, but remember that this guy has the mental acuity of a child so Keller is functionally abusing a child. And I don't think the movie is ever actually asking us to side with Keller on the abuse (though it glosses over the irony that Keller has kidnapped and abused a child to find a child), because there's only, by my reckoning, four pieces of evidence Keller uses to justify his own personal Abu Ghraib:	1) Alex is seen in the neighborhood parked in a creepy, rundown RV around when the girls disappear;	2) When the police find the RV, Alex tries to run away. And by run away, I mean this guy with a scared child's mind drives his RV directly into a tree;	3) When attacked by Keller after being released by the police, Alex says, ""They didn't cry until I left them."";	4) And Alex later says, after days of torture, including being locked in a box and having scalding hot and freezing cold water sprayed on him, ""They're in the maze. That's where you'll find them.""I think forefront in the audience's mind is that Keller has let his desperation get control of him to the point that he is torturing a man-child and drawing an otherwise unsubstantiated conclusion from a couple of things Alex says while scared or in pain or both, and placing all hope of his daughter's survival on his faith that he can will Alex's guilt into being through sheer brutal determination. So of course Keller is more or less right, because this movie doesn't have the fucking moral conviction to let the self-determined White Man be absolutely fucking wrong about what he's done and then maybe deal with the consequences of his morally reprehensible actions. Turns out that Alex's aunt, Holly (Melissa Leo), is actually a serial murderer who, along with her now deceased husband, kidnapped dozens or hundreds of kids through the years in order to destroy parents' faith in God or some such nonsense, and Alex is one of those kids who is mentally handicapped because of that torture. So while it isn't technically Alex who abducted the girls, Keller is still right to pour all his manly energy into torturing Alex, because it leads him to his daughter's kidnapper anyway. And if you're thinking–But he was right and therefore everything he did was worth it in the end because his daughter lived—then you need to take a long look in the mirror, because you're saying exactly what Keller's wife says, ""He did what he had to do to find Anna, and I thank God for that"", which is actually just the movie saying–Hey, don't feel bad about Alex, because Keller was impossibly right will maybe go to jail for the whole re-torturing an abuse victim thing anyway.This fucking movie wants you to absolve Keller, and that's what is so goddamn detestable. Keller has almost no reason to believe Alex has anything to do with his daughter's disappearance other than the creepy RV thing and what Alex says when Keller first attacks him, which he only says because he's scripted to say it. And I point out that last part because Alex is silent through days of torture and only at the plot-convenient time does he say the one additional thing that Keller needs in order to reaffirm his conviction about what he's done. But we're not led to believe in Alex's guilt in any other way and instead given the morally questionable direction to think Alex is only saying these things because of past trauma and not current guilt, because we are not meant to believe in Keller's conviction. Meanwhile, we have to witness Keller's violence against Alex while constantly saying to ourselves—You're wrong, you're wrong, please stop torturing the guy who literally knows nothing other than he might die at any moment. But all that guilt for watching a man with a mental disability get his face pummeled and his body burned and frozen is supposed to wash away because it is Alex's aunt, the original abuser, who kidnapped Keller's daughter.That Abu Ghraib comparison is a bit of hyperbole except that it totally fits. Based on little to no evidence, Keller does whatever he thinks is necessary to stave off tragedy, but unlike the real world, this movie gets to say it is all worth it. And it is all worth it because the movie makes it work out as so. Just because it's a movie and it should be allowed to do what it wants to tell its story doesn’t absolve it of the objectionable way in which it gets to its point. And make no mistake, this movie's point is that—Keller. Is. Right. He is right to see guilt where literally no one else did. He is right to torture an abuse victim. And he is right to go after Holly alone because no one would believe him since he's been torturing a guy the whole time, but uh maybe going alone actually delays Holly's plan to kill Keller's daughter, and maybe the cops wouldn't go to Holly's place if not for finding out Keller had kidnapped and tortured Alex or uh something like that? Yeah, the end really gives up on any pretense about how you're supposed to feel about Keller's actions for the last two hours, because Holly gets the drop on him and throws him in a pit where no one can find him to die, and the cops show up to let Holly know her barely alive nephew has been found but then just barely stop Holly from killing Keller's daughter, which would have happened if Keller hadn't been a violent psycho, or so we're lead to believe now.It's all absolute bullshit in justifying Keller's actions, because movies like this are malevolent male fantasies about how with just the right amount of determination, just the right amount of paranoia, just the right amount of moral ambiguity, you too can do what it takes to overcome a crisis. Keller seems a little off for believing an apocalypse might come, and yet a much smaller one limited to just his family does come so his right-wing fantasies are given validation. Kidnapping and torturing a guy who's already gone through kidnapping and torture are justified, because Keller's actions kinda, sorta lead to the return of his daughter. And even though he gets buried in a hole by Holly for being so fucking stupid and sure of his own natural abilities to hurt people, the final moment this movie decides to end on is a reassurance to the audience that Keller does not die as a consequence of his actions. In fact, he will be saved. Fuck. This. Movie.***3 1/2 Stars for everything good it does do.-3 Stars for being an ethically soulless piece of garbage that wants you to be okay with torture because oh, maybe, what if, we don't want to think about what would happen if Keller didn't do it.",0,prisoners

46980,"Yojimbo, one of Kurosawa's famous works - I had to give this a watch. I looked at the last Kurosawa film I watched and it was Seven Samurai nearly a year ago already, so you could say I'm a little overdue for one of his many films I have to get around to seeing. Anyway, this was of course pretty great. Seven Samurai is by no means the most serious film in the world, but Yojimbo does feel a lot more lighthearted and almost playful in comparison. The comedy elements in here are great, and the film spends a lot of time with the characters conversing with each other and less time on the battlegrounds - something I'm actually okay with considering how well all the characters are fleshed out. It took me a while to realize Toshiro Mifune was playing the main character in the film - his performance is a lot more toned down than in SS so it took me by surprise, yet he's just as good in a quieter role as he was in a loud one. The story in this film is done very creatively by Kurosawa, and a film with this premise has to definitely work to make it entertaining; in other words, this could've been a slog if it was put in the wrong hands and forunately, it wasn't. I'm really happy with this one. I'm gonna have to give Sanjuro a look soon as well. I almost feel like this character would work well in a TV show, so it's unfortunate that there's only two films with him - oh well! Better than only one I suppose. Definitely give this one a look.",7,yojimbo
83514,"[deep breath] There are people who believe the idea of Godard making an unsuccessful film is purely hypothetical, and they get very upset with intellectually-underperforming philistines who aren't with the program, a level of dedication with a certain level of faith-investment I find hard to muster. That commitment goes for Tarkovsky too, but (ulp) I'm an agnostic. So look: Nostalghia is gorgeous, in non-maximalist ways that have to do with slivers of light and shade reflected on the tiniest of surfaces. (I could see a film like this serving as the basis for e.g. the entire Lisandro Alonso project thus far.) Tarkovsky understands that the compositional differences that ensue when moving a camera even six inches can be enormous, and close attention is required to keep up. No problem!And yet: here's a filmmaker who said, no joke intended, ""I can't stand mirth. Cheerful people seem guilty to me, because they can't comprehend the mournful value of existence. I accept happiness only in children and the elderly, with all others I am intolerant."" This isn't even that far off from my worldview, but I find it hard to take when it's so clearly and strongly expressed, without anything to dispel the one-directional gloom aside from a friendly canine (dogs get a pass too, apparently). For Tarkovsky, faith and spirituality is a constant quest most clearly expressed in a slow trudge through an obstacle course of his own devising, one in which the most minute journey distance-wise is an arduous trek, in which every step has as much potential difficulty and degree of difference for the person moving as for the camera. Here, his chosen sites of contemplation are interiors that are very much Zone II, to the point of self-parody — water dripping down from the ceiling onto a tiled floor exactly here, a rusty object placed meticulously right there, all calibrated for certain depth-of-frame effects — to the point where this is closer to an installation than a film. The result seems (to me, of little faith) a melding of the worst of The Mirror (more of father Arseniy's poetry and more overt autobiography, the filmmaker-in-exile represented rather bluntly) without that film's giddy speed and Stalker.",5,nostalgia-1983

i didn't really notice at first, but that last shot went on for a LONG time; acting is absolutely top-notch from both leadsep 2wasn't the hugest fan of the segment in johan's workplace, where one of his co-workers criticize his poetry... not sure what that really added, but maybe it'll click when i watch the rest of the serieslove that subtle boob grab towards the end right after their talk on ""intimacy""... only to have him turn down sex a few minutes after... talk about being a lazy loverep 3can see some huge influences this film had on marriage story now... some shots look like recreations, especially the bed scenesjohan makes a decision that seems like it was just straight up out of nowhere... the whole episode actually just revolves around this, and there's literally like two setting changes in this whole episodefound this to be pretty riveting as an episode, and it actually feels like something that wouldn't be nearly as impactful as a film, weirdly enoughep 4i really liked the scene where marianne reads her diary to johan, fully spilling her guts and revealing so much about herself, only to have johan fall asleep; i think that was very powerful moment of how indifferent johan wasi do think johan loves his wife (or loved her at one point), but it's clear that he sees her more as an idea than as an actual human; they start really breaking down the nasty parts of their marriage, and johan just didn't want to put that much effort in the relationship, since he thought the just putting minimum effort would be enoughthis episode, marianne has really started discovering herself; breaking away from the conventions and what society expects from a woman, she starts living for herself, and i was really glad to see thatep 5the part where marianne tells her soon-to-be ex-husband to make love with her, and they'll get divorced the next day will probably stick with me forever; the way her emotions just spill out of her feels so raw and honest; to yearn for one last feeling of physical intimacy before (possibly) saying goodbye to it forever is just such a sad concept, and ullmann plays that part SO WELLthe climax of the episode is definitely the altercation between the two, but before that, it's revealed that johan has not really benefitted from his new marriage; he definitely has kind of a sexist attitude towards his spouses, constantly trying to prove that he's better than them, and this attitude really hurts him, especially in the later episodes, when he starts feeling emptier and smaller inside (and even literally shrinks by an inch)ep 6a very depressing final episode reflecting on the now-divorced couple reflecting on what could have been, and how their new relationships compare to their marriage; neither seem fully satisfied, and they both talk about how they have benefitted each other, but it's sad to know that despite that, they fully compatible eitherboth are holding on to the past, and they go to a cottage and reminisce on memories that they are so desperately trying to cherish, only to have the cold reality hit them at the end of the night; they are once again reminded of why the relationship didn't work out in the first place, which i think is instigated by a nightmare that marianne has; overall it's really depressing lol, and i kinda enjoyed it a lot; it affected me quite deeplyfinal thoughtssome funky zooms aside, the film was expertly shot; bergman proves that even with very minimalistic production design, a good script and interesting cinematography goes a long way; while it's not shot in a super flashy way, the long-takes really allow the actors to express their emotions fully; it never feels like the director is trying to steal the show from the actors, because this is so clearly an actor-driven vehicle; this is something that i would love to visit later in life when i am actually marriedi do have a few minor issues, but i think the only one that is worth mentioning is the passage of time; i know that in the dialogue, they state how long time has passed in each episode; like in episode 6, it's revealed that it has been 20 years since they have been married, but their appearances don't really articulate that, and i wish the make-up team would have added some aging on the two leads so that it was more clear that a lot of time has passed, since this show does span for ten yearslastly, i think scenes from a marriage actually benefits from a ""miniseries"" format; i didn't binge-watch the show, and instead i watched the six episodes in a span of four days, so with the breaks in between each episode, it was actually easier to feel the passage of time between each episode; i have a feeling that in film format, i would have been more distracted by a time-jump when it didn't feel like there was onemasterpiece",9,scenes-from-a-marriage

The triptych sequence is iconic and creative of course, but there's so much more worth noting - a shaky chase on horseback, battles drenched in fluorescent reds, a storm gorgeously intercut with an uprising. But the length is oppressive to me, and it all gets drowned out in repetitive politics. The gorgeous images remain, the powerful moments work their magic, but there's just a lot here that I can't get fully invested in. I know there's a shorter cut, so I may check that out eventually, though hopefully knowing that it's a neutered version of a larger whole won't ruin that for me.Everyone calling this a masterpiece is more correct than I am.

43562,"Dreadful. Completely guts the source material, reducing all the major characters to a single personality trait (usually selflessness) and shrinking the scope of the story to melodrama size. Egregious dubbing makes it impossible to judge half the performances, and the other half are far from flawless. Audrey Hepburn is bafflingly inconsistent in her line delivery, Mel Ferrer walks through the film like a zombie, and Henry Fonda is irredeemably miscast. The best work by far is put in by John Mills and Herbert Lom, purely thanks to their being the only two people onscreen who speak and act with any sense of life. King Vidor's direction is positively arthritic, while Nino Rota delivers what has to be his least interesting score ever. Jack Cardiff's painterly cinematography and the impressive scale come close to saving the film: it's visually appealing even when it's dramatically and emotionally inert.The real problem with everything is that you simply cannot hack a three-and-a-half-hour film out of a novel of War and Peace's breadth - inevitably the plot becomes an outline, while character and theme are sent flying out the window.

I have a lot to say about The Song of the Little Road, and it's only the first movie in the Apu Trilogy!Outside of Rab Ne Bana De Jodi and a few other modern Bollywood films, I really don't know that much about Indian Cinema. I love films that really make me feel like I am in a different time and place, and Bollywood has never really done that for me. Pather Panchali, on the other hand, really made me feel like I was in a bygone era. It barely even feels like 1910, but seeing this glimpse into this world really stunned me.This 1955 film was made with almost no budget from what I'm reading, and the way the minimalism is used in this sweeping black-and-white coming of age story is beautiful. There's no other word to describe it. The village where the story takes place may be rudimentary at best but wow does it feel like a living, breathing universe. Apu, the boy who is a part of this universe, witnesses it, experiences it, and lives with these baleful, all-seeing eyes that are filled with hope and despair. In other words, it's a perfect encapsulation of childhood and the loss of innocence! All of the actors are brilliant. The way the story unfolds is naturalistic and DENSE.

60267,"*Spoilers for all Evangelion media, including the previous rebuilds, television series, and subsequent film*And I thought trying to write about the last three was hard... forgive me if these paragraphs end up flowing like a mixtape on shuffle, but I just want to try and get all of my thoughts down. I'll try and take it scene-by-scene.Shinji spends the first act of the film in the midst of crippling depression, that is, he doesn't move, talk, eat, or do anything at all. Wait, no, he vomits on the floor a couple times. But other than that: nothing. Asuka also does nothing of value for the first act. She basically just sits around this one guy's house in various stages of undress and complains. Also, she casually mentions that she is an artificial clone with no soul. But I'll get to that later. New Rei in the first act is honestly the only good part of the film. She basically just roams around the settlement like a little child, learning new words, making friends, getting a sense of identity, and asking questions. It's cute I guess. But, of course, it is also revealed that she has no soul as well.After a while, Rei gets tired of the city and her friends and takes an interest in Shinji, repeatedly visiting him in his crippled state and giving him bread, crackers, or whatever spare food she has available. Luckily, it turns out that these visits were actually the magic cure to depression. Remember that, kids! Taking responsibility for your own life is futile, and you should never try to change yourself! If you're ever feeling sad, mope around for weeks on end until someone else comes to save you!And, it's not even a touching message about human connection, because Rei and Asuka aren't even human anymore. They don't have any free will, and all of their issues are inherent and unfixable, the film implies. They are just puppets created by Gendo as part of some big prank on Shinji.Turns out the prank backfired though because now Rei has literally just spontaneously combusted and Shinji is pissed. Now it is time for him and Asuka to go get on a spaceship and beat up Gendo for revenge. Also turns out that Mari is on the spaceship as well, just so she and Shinji can have one conversation where he says ""nice tits"" and then they get married. What they see in each other, we will never know. But we have to put everyone in relationships at the end, or else the fans won't be satisfied, right?Anyway, now everyone is on the spaceship headed to find Gendo. Turns out he is living in a bunker underneath Antarctica or something, so all of the characters have to ride in this colorful abyss tunnel for an hour and beat up space aliens on the way. You see, one of the things that makes End of Evangelion so great is its relationship with stakes. The stakes are massive, the fate of Earth and all of humanity is on the table. But the film focuses entirely on Shinji (and Asuka, Gendo, Rei, etc of course) and their internal dilemmas. We end up caring more about Shinji overcoming his depression than we care about him saving the world. This film has none of that, with most of the action scenes having overdramatic yet pathetic stakes (the world ends, like, five times in this series I swear). We always know that Shinji and co will come out on top. No matter how many big mecha space fights and colorful aliens come on screen, I don't care at all. Finally, after enough aliens are killed, Gendo walks into the color tunnel himself. I actually laughed at this moment; after all of these mindless hordes of giant angels it turns out the final boss was just this tiny middle-aged man with weird Ray-bans. I expected nothing less.Of course, upon seeing Gendo, Shinji and the gang immediately just shoot him in the head. Turns out he is immortal though, so nothing happens. At this point Shinji is real mad, so he decides to follow Gendo into this dream world so they can beat each other up. After about 10 minutes of fistfighting, they realize that violence shockingly isn't the answer to their problems. Instead, they take a second to sit down and talk about feelings, with both of them perfectly and calmly articulating everything that makes up their psyches in a single conversation. They both quickly come to a simple solution for their complex problem; Gendo apologizes to Shinji and then just... disappears. A win-win, I guess, if you consider ""sorry"" to be fair compensation for years of abuse, and think that teenagers are perfectly fine with no parental figures. At this point Shinji is really energized, I guess, since he helped his father realize the errors of his ways. So he decides to become omnipotent, resurrect Kaworu, and then go on a vision quest. He and Kaworu then systematically go into all of the dead character's minds for talk therapy sessions, listening to their problems and then resurrecting them. Oh yes, forgot to mention that Kaworu is only doing this for selfish reasons apparently. Some kind of karma thing I guess, he thinks that if he makes others happy it will make him happy. A nice sentiment, I guess, but it really undercuts Kaworu's character being a beacon of selflessness, literally sacrificing his life to please Shinji in the previous film. But in the end, it turns out that character development really doesn't matter. The key to contentedness was just waiting for someone else to solve your problems. In the final minutes of the film, it cuts to a live-action shot, showing how you, too, can revive everyone you've ever lost to achieve happiness. God...",2,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time

72760,"Fourth Roeg, this was a bizarre miss that I am still trying to understand the point of. A typical review of this movie praises the relatively short part of the movie where Jack McCann (Gene Hackman) is prospecting for gold in turn of the century Yukon, and admonishes the parts set in the Caribbean. Despite the beginning for sure being the most interesting part of the movie, I was surprised by how little of it landed. The visuals, no doubt, are good for the entire duration of the movie. But the script is dog shit, with repeated clunkers such as ""I've never earned a nickel from another man's sweat!"" that read like a first draft. The vague occultism that Jack encounters in this part and continues through the rest of the movie is more confusing than interesting, though the voodoo/orgy scenes later in the movie help break the tedium. The presumably homeless man who brutally commits suicide early on is clearly meant to be a harbinger of doom, but it feels like a hat on a hat given how overdone this part of the movie is. The actual scene where he strikes gold is well shot, and probably the highlight of Eureka.The rest of the movie, taking place on ""Eureka"", the name of Jack's private residence in the Caribbean, is confused and hard to sit through. The movie eventually becomes about the relationship between Theresa Russell and Rutger Hauer and feels like it's an entirely separate movie. Both give decent performances, but there's just nothing to do with the material. This all takes place against the backdrop of ""the war"" (WWII, specifically the Battle of the Caribbean) which doesn't really add anything to the movie other than demonstrating the stark class differences between Jack's servants / native islanders vs the upper-class white people. This isn't particularly well handled despite the very obvious critiques of capitalism that follow from the nature of the story. The mafia angle, despite featuring both Joe Pesci and a young Mickey Rourke, has no legs and feels like it is solely there for capturing the plot point of Jack's fate.The comparisons to There Will Be Blood and of course Citizen Kane make sense, given the megalomania of the central character and similar themes, but those are better movies in literally every single way. Would you believe that Jack's life after striking gold is empty in all meaningful ways? That he spends his later years in paranoia about getting fleeced by his son-in-law? The way his life plays out is so clearly forecasted and predictable from early in the movie that it makes one wonder why his life is worth exploring as a feature-length film. Who cares about this one-dimensional guy that lives purely for the rush of striking gold? And worse, who cares about the relationship between his daughter and son-in-law?This is the movie that made me realize I do not like Gene Hackman as an actor.",2,eureka

Also Wilder smartly uses Kirk Douglas' natural charm to his advantage as he plays with how the viewer thinks about his character throughout the runtime, and yet never lets the viewer fully hate or despise him.

I spent 2 hours and 20 minutes listening to a ""story"" that gets explained in about 10 minutes during the middle of the film, with filler all around it... For starters, the pacing is atrocious. Dragging through several sections, while speedrunning through any semblance of a cohesive narrative. It seems like they just wanted to cram as much fan service and quipy one-liners as they could into the film, without putting any real thought into why they're there in the first place. It plays like it was written by chatGPT – perfectly tailored to draw nostalgia from Spiderman stans who can swoon over pointing out easter eggs – without a single emotionally sincere bone in it's bloated body. The worst part is that the whole film is basically an extended trailer for the next movie, because everything that it sets up gets absolutely no closure. I expected that going in, but the fact that literally every single thread was left open just felt like they were milking it for all it's worth. I also seem to be the only person on the planet that thinks the animation itself is overrated. It's not bad, and it is admittedly stylish just like the first one. However, this just felt completely excessive, like they tried to throw every single idea they had into the film – instead of making it all work as one. In one scene it will switch styles multiple times, which I guess works for some, but I started to get annoyed with it after a while. I guess it just didn't feel as smooth to me as the first one did.   I honestly feel like I'm making my turn as the Joker over here... After watching this, I just want to watch the movie industry burn... This just felt like more MCU garbage to me. Soulless nonsense without a drop of originality or depth. The first one was leagues ahead of this in my opinion. If you genuinely enjoyed the movie, I'm glad you did.

51761,"TW: mentions of rapeMen Are Shit: The MovieThis never seemed to end! It's one of those films that thinks it's being so smart and appears to be critiquing toxic masculinity, but only ends up promoting it even more. The female characters in this serve as mere plot points and are characterizations of poor stereotypes - the strict and internally misogynistic mother, the prostitute whom no one respects (more on her later), the doting wife who exists solely to create conflict between the mother and her son before doing basically nothing, and the waiflike manic pixie dream girl who is just kind of there to be cute.I was vibing with the film for the first hour or so, as I liked seeing the relationships between all of the characters develop. The cinematography and score were quite nice as well. But after the rape scene I was disgusted and didn't feel like suffering through almost two more hours. It was terrible that Nadia's rape was depicted onscreen, for the length that it was, and so violently. I'm honestly appalled that so many people on here love Rocco because I thought he was just as awful as Simone (I guess not as obviously.) The film even tries to paint him as a literal saint, which is bullshit. He watches Nadia as she is raped, doesn't approach her afterward or try to offer any sort of comfort. He decides the best thing to do afterwards is beat up her attacker - his brother Simone - and therefore we are meant to identify with *his* pain over this event. Nadia walks away in shame as several men look down upon her, even the man who supposedly loves her (who is also bawling his eyes out, though not because he feels for her, because he is ashamed that she ""allowed"" herself to be raped.)To make matters worse, Rocco makes her go back to her rapist because he thinks it will be better for her and that Simone ""loves her."" The final nail in the coffin for me was when Nadia was murdered at the hands of her rapist, once again shown in a gratuitous manner. The way her pain is presented is so heart-wrenching and we are so clearly meant to watch her suffer. I had to skip the scene because it made me want to throw up.The film offers no commentary on the evilness of Simone, as he is FORGIVEN by Rocco and we are subjected to watching him be upset that she wouldn't ""die fast enough."" It's so childish and honestly quite disturbing. Nadia is just there to be a plot point to further the brothers' relationship with each other and she's always depicted in a judgmental fashion by both the characters and the filmmaker.I'm tired of watching these supposed masterpieces that just involve one or more men being absolute pieces of shit for 3 HOURS and not getting anything of worth out of it.The performances were kind of the only saving grace (other than how it looked), and I was at least glad to see that Alain Delon does seem to have a little bit of soul within himself. This was just based on my first impression of him in Purple Noon, in which it seemed like he was always going to be heartless and boring in everything. Far too much time was spent on Simone and I thought the other brothers were more interesting. There wasn't even that much boxing, which I originally thought was a main point within the film. The fights were kind of boring, since there were neither stakes nor reasons to root for any of the fighters.It just made me so angry and I really don't have time for these kinds of movies anymore. I get that it's influential, but there are lots of films about both boxing, family, and toxic masculinity that 1) came before this one and 2) actually offer thoughtful critiques on their subjects.",1,rocco-and-his-brothers

26422,"Ugh. This should have been a 100-minute movie. It would have been an insufferably pretentious, self-important, dreary movie, with a weak story and pretentious dialogue that is embarrassingly on the nose. But at least it would have been reasonably short. Instead, this movie is more than seven hours long, and some of the static shots go on for eight or ten minutes at a time, with no appreciable action occurring at any point. It’s as if the director is so in love with his shot set-ups that he wants the audience to have to stare at his raw footage forever, like some depressing live-action coffee-table book. It’s among the most arrogant and self-aggrandizing displays I’ve ever seen. And that’s without even addressing the movie’s horrible treatment of an actual cat. Starting around the three-hour mark, we have to watch a young girl abuse a cat for 30 or 40 minutes. The things that she does to this cat definitely qualify as abuse, but the cat does not fight back, probably because it was either sedated or (shudder) had been trained to withstand abuse without complaint. The director claims that the cat was not harmed, presumably because the cat did not resist the abuse, but the fact that the cat did not fight back does not mean that it did not suffer. And although the director claims that he did not kill the cat, the cat is definitely dead the last time we see it—it is obviously suffering from rigor mortis, and its tail looks fractured (maybe a post-mortem injury that occurred during rigor mortis). So my guess is that the cat was scheduled to be euthanized already, which is why the director can claim that he did not kill the cat, but I do not buy the idea that this cat survived this shoot. And of course the director isn’t going to own up to what happened to the cat—it might make people think twice before calling this movie a masterpiece—but his post-hoc claims about the cat are basically the equivalent of him asking us, “Who are you going to believe, me or your own eyes?”",0,satantango

And this isn't about actors or aesthetic, it has everything to do with the weight of the world and how it wears you down.  Of course, there are other films such as Early Summer and An Autumn Afternoon and can also be viewed in this manner, but for me Tokyo Story somehow captures this feeling better than others.This film is often bitter, but then, so is life.  And life goes on.  The parents visit Tokyo, but their children have no time to spare for them.   Not necessarily because they hate them, but they have to own lives to manage and that's difficult enough.  When the parents how Tokyo has changed, they might as well be referring to the children. There's death, but there's also life anew.  The father turns out to be rather forward thinking in the way he deals with family matters.  His time may also be short but he wants to make sure that others won't have any regrets, especially the Hara character who despite being an outsider was the most kind to them.  Speaking of her, there's a quote from author Shusaku Endo which states:  ""Can it be possible that there is such a woman in this world?""  He might as well be speaking of the character she plays in Tokyo Story.  She's almost too good to be true, even for those days.  No actress was better than Hara at smiling through pain and this film is the best example of it.  She expressed so much with so little.  As you would imagine, Tokyo Story contains all of Ozu's trademark motifs - low camera height, 180 degree cuts, linking pillow shots, etc. - and of course his precise control of framing and editing and structure.",9,tokyo-story

4950,"Yesterday was my birthday, July 3, and I wanted to celebrate that by watching Ikiru. A film that I've had my eye on for what seems like forever now. I was beyond excited for this film. It seemed similar to It's Such a Beautiful Day, and I just thought that it sounded like everything I want in a movie. The premise is genius, a dying man dedicating his final days into building a childrens playground. I was ecstatic when I got my Max working, because that meant I could finally watch this film that everyone unanimously said was a masterpiece. Everyone that is, except me.Because after watching Ikiru, I can confidently say that teh emotion I felt after watching wasn't sadness. It wasn't peace, tranquility, nor a bittersweet type of happiness. It was anger, more specifically frustration. Frustration at the film, and how it was structured and written. But more than that, I was frustrated that there are some true gems of cinema hidden in here, and all that potential was squandered by a bumbling second act, and a self indulgent and needlessly wordy final act.The first act is undeniably fantastic. It was everything I wanted, and the scene of the protagonist finding out he has stomach cancer is genius in it's concept and execution. It's done in a unique and masterful way, that truly blew my mind. We also get one of the greatest performances in film in the form of Takashi Shimura, who gives off true sadness, out of nothing but facial expressions.This just makes me more angry at what happens in the rest of the film. Here's how I personally wanted the film to go:I wanted the first act to be how it is, and I wanted the second act to be the protagonist slowly growing, and coming to terms with him dying and his life. And then I wanted the third act to be with him achieving peace, and finally building the playground. In many ways it's similar to an ACTUALLY masterful tale: Neil Gaiman's Signal to Noise, which is about a dying filmaker, making a film that nobody will see. He's sad at first, but after he stops taking his meds, he achieves happiness, and works on his film, that he realizes he can release, if he focuses hard enough.Instead what we got was an hour of Ikiru bumbling around prostitutes and a young woman coworker, and then a final act that just states stuff that should have been conveyed to us in a more clever way. I can understand what they were trying to go for in the second act, as the message of the protagonist trying to live life to his fullest before he dies, is admittedly beautiful (and that scene of him singing is jaw dropping), but it's the final act that pisses me off the most, as it's a key example of telling instead of showing. People just talk about the messages of the film and feelings inside the protagonist, which is incredibly lazy. A more creative and smart creator would have tried to show those messages throughout the film, leaving the audience to mull over it.There are literally multiple scenes where it cuts to the protagonist just standing there, and then after that we get 5 minutes of people talking about what he was thinking and feeling. Come on guys! How is this so critically acclaimed?!This is so similar to A Silent Voice. 2 japanese films that everyone loves, but I find to be lazy, underwritten, and boring. Oh yeah also Jack King aggrees with me hating them. Wow.Anyway, thanks to Ben;Blah for reccommending this to me.

55836,"William Goldman's quirky, gritty character study/crime drama screenplay deserved a better director than Dick Richards.

Burt and Peter MacNicol make a good mentor/protegé team, a relationship that slowly and organically develops over the span of the plot.  The sociopath/hoodlum/trust fundie villain is deliciously despicable.  The Las Vegas setting captures a city that doesn't quite exist anymore and at times recalls PT Anderson's minor key debut Hard Eight.There are some unintentionally hilarious moments when Burt's character, who describes himself as 'way over 40', has to fight and run and swing roundhouse kicks and jump over fences.

85763,"What bothers me the most about this movie has to be that the director deliberately points out the frequent abuse in elite musical education, but then goes to destroy every potentially good message about that by justifying the abuse as necessary if you want to be a good musician. Which is absolute bullshit, for a more elaborate reasoning please read Richard Brody's article ""Getting Jazz Right in the Movies"".Additionally, it's equally unacceptable how the movie uses homophobic, anti-semitic, fatphobic, ableist and mysoginistc slurs without painting them as entirely wrong. Instead it's protrayed as an acceptable way of showing your anger or driving someone to perfection.Finally, albeit less important, what bothers me about this movie is this lack of actual musical influence. For a movie about music it feels like the director never once talked to a musician. Not only does the protagonist not give a single shit about music (once again better explained in Richard Brody's article), but even not being a professional it's obvious to someone who watches live music once in a while that the conducting of the teacher is horribly inaccurate.

30247,"Like many Kurosawas, Red Beard saunters out of the gates and for a while you may wonder if it's worth sticking with. And as always with Kurosawas, it is. At over three hours it does demand patience, and the story (taken from a short story collection and thus incorporating several plot threads) does arguably deserve the 'soap opera' label some have stuck to it,  but the last hour brings those threads together relatively nicely and the big issues Kurosawa explores go way beyond anything you would have seen on General Hospital.Although, this IS set in a hospital, or at least a clinic, at some point anywhere between the 16th and 18th centuries, by my best guess. Toshiro Mifune, in his last collaboration with Kurosawa, plays Red Beard, an irascible but gold-hearted doctor who tends to the rural poor, prostitutes and other of the great unwashed - think of him as Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life, only he's a doctor in Japan and not suicidal.No, instead of an angel, into his life walks arrogant, ambitious young doctor Yasumoto (Yuzo Kayama) who initially does not want to be there, and has the hissy fit to prove it. From that moment on you can guess roughly how his character arc is going to develop under the boss. And yes, this is actually one of the more predictable, straight-ahead Kurosawas I've seen. Not that that matters all that much, because along the way, especially in the gut-kicking second half, there are meaningful stops at the issues of death and mortality, of kindness and empathy, of selfishness vs selflessness, of humility.I should say that of the Kurosawas I've seen to date (just passed the halfway mark with this one!) this has the least levity, alongside 1963's High and Low, made just before this one, probably not coincidentally . (This one hits way harder. Trust me.)Note 1: I learned after watching Red Beard that one of the threads (as it happens my favourite and the most-gut-wrenching one, about a wretched 12-yo girl rescued from the clutches of a brothel) is not from Shūgorō Yamamoto's short story collection but from Dostoevsky's Humiliated and Insulted. Note 2: There's a scene in which Red Beard displays previously hidden skills at the martial arts and destroys a gaggle of brothel muscle guys who helpfully come at him one by one instead of rushing him en masse. Sigh. The whole thing is totally incongruous and farcical and the only really false note in my book.Note 3: I was often moved but truly shocked only once by what Kurosawa was prepared to show on screen, and that is the surgery being performed on a writhing young woman. I just recently underwent surgery and I can't imagine what it must have been like to wield a scalpel and put in sutures on a bucking bronco like that. Jesus! Just brutal scene, that.Note 4: Says online that Kurosawa went a little nuts with this production and spent months, nay years building the sets, including virtually an entire small village, some of which barely makes it onto the screen, and filling it with century-old wood, period tiles and other stuff and even ensuring the beds used in the clinic were slept in for six months before filming.Oh and just remembered the one really funny scene, involving Red Beard's reluctant house call to tend to the local Lord, a disgusting, wheezing blob of sweaty fat that had to have been an inspiration for Jabba the Hutt. It was uncanny!",7,red-beard

I understand why a lot of people would consider this his masterpiece, but after seeing these 3 films, I'm kinda confused why people hold this director as highly as they do. I think his films are good, but I don't find that they're hitting me on a profound level like a lot of others. I like the same things about each of his movies, but I'm just not getting the oomph a lot of people get.Greatest movie of all time? No way. Great film in general?

55822,"On the surface, ""Heat"" (no, not that one) sounds like a pretty typical action flick. Burt Reynolds plays a guy nicknamed Mex (apparently he's Mexican..?) whose friend, a prostitute, is raped by the evil prick son of a notorious criminal boss. Mex helps her get her revenge. But ""Heat"" isn't your typical action flick. In fact, it's anything but. For one thing, the woman in question gets her revenge by the end of the first half an hour. After that, ""Heat"" shifts gears and becomes a character study of a perpetual loser with gambling issues and violent tendencies. Mex is a nice guy, but he can't seem to get out of his own way, which is why he never quite seems to save up the money he needs to achieve his dream of moving to Venice, Italy. This all comes to light when a timid young man enlists Mex to be his bodyguard while he gambles. The relationship evolves as the film goes on, with Mex bearing his soul to this young man while trying to teach him how to be more assertive and manly. Meanwhile, this young man helps Mex realize a few things about himself, and about how he might be able to evolve...that is if he can survive the retaliations of the mob boss's son (who seems like the direct inspiration for the little shit who kills John Wick's dog in ""John Wick""). To get a sense of what makes this movie so unique, picture ""The Equalizer"" if it put the action on pause for an hour in the middle so we could just hang out with the main character while he gambles and connects with a new friend. The rhythm and structure of this movie honestly takes some getting used to, but if you do the movie definitely makes it worth one's while. The middle section is what makes the film so fascinating, and sets it apart from the standard films that occupy this genre. The script, by William Goldman, doesn't have the best dialogue, but the character work and the original flow of it are extraordinary. Plus, when the action does erupt it's pretty stellar. It may rely a bit too heavily on 80s tricks like slow motion, but the actions Mex takes are awesomely badass. The culmination of all of this, the showdown between Mex and main villain, is totally unique to me within the annals of action cinema and so awesomely badass that I wouldn't dare risk ruining it. Let me simply say: Holy Shit!The acting helps too. Burt Reynolds seems to be relishing the opportunity to find a new gear and slow things down. This might have less winking at the audience from him than any film I've seen (well, that he made between ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Boogie Nights"" anyway). There are moments that seem intent on subverting audience's expectations from a Burt Reynolds movie more than anything else, and I loved them. The opening scene, for instance, starts to play out like your average Burt Reynolds moment, all unknowingly misogynist and allegedly charming, but then it reveals that behavior for the toxic bullshit that it is and takes things in a different direction. And the movie has a lot of moments like that. It allows Burt to be thoroughly charming, but not in as aggressive a fashion as many of his films. Also, Peter MacNicol (a.k.a. The Best Thing about ""Ghostbusters 2"") is wonderful as the young man who hires Burt to be his bodyguard. I love how he and Reynolds play off of one another, and would have loved to see a sequel with the two of them hanging out in Venice. MacNicol's ultimate fate is kind of bullshit, but it's the satisfying sort of bullshit. Karen Young is less good as the woman who enlists his help at the beginning, but she's fine I suppose.I don't know that I would have sought this movie out if not for Reynolds's passing leading me to dive deeper into his filmography, but I'm quite glad that I did, and would highly recommend it to anyone else. It's kind of awkward at times (the score by Michael Gibbs is pretty lousy) but its unique rhythms and emphasis on character is refreshing. It's definitely not the ""paint-by-numbers"" affair that I feared it would be, not by a longshot.",6,heat

What we view as an ambient noise becomes a key to stirring our minds into indulging our deepest impulses. It’s those noises that convince you. Haven’t seen a film before that quite captures the fear of not being in control of yourself like this.

87485,"202-minute punch to the diaphragm. Spike Lee used his creative and cultural capital at an early height of his powers to make this, an enduring and lasting monument not only to Malcolm X himself, but to Black Power, Black Creativity, Black Independence. Malcolm X is a hero to me because he is someone who truly inhabited the truth of who they were and where they were at each moment in their lives as fully as possible and when information and wisdom came to them which threatened their understanding of the world, they did not pull away and retreat into dogma, but allow that new understanding to revolutionize their oonsciousness completely not once but over and over and over again and to never retreat from that truth, to never compromise. Malcolm X the film likewise, is not one film but several: a gangster noir, a prison drama, a religious epic, a paranoid political thriller; each of these it fully inhabits so completely that the viewer feels like that is the film that it was meant to be all along until a crack appears somewhere, barely perceptible at first, but gradually widening until the film sheds itself and becomes something altogether not-other, but a fulfillment of everything that had come to pass and more, recapitulating at every stage all of the wonders and strengths and cruel ironies of every stage before it, mapping symmetries onto symmetries (one could write an entire review about how Malcolm's relationship to his self-presentation presages a shift in his being at every turn in his life) until they connect into circuits and the charge flows through, a series of suites where one is pulled into the next by the nascent presence of the future in the past, on and on until its ultimate doom, the final, unending sounding.Amerikkka was founded upon the two essential atrocities of African Slavery and Native American Genocide. This has been true for over 400 years. It is true every day and no matter how many more years pass it won't stop being true. Everything that we here in the United States know, everything that we see around us every day, all of our institutions arose from and still today serve the interests which they were founded to serve. It should be no surprise that they do. That is what they were made for. We can't ignore these basic facts, cannot go by another day without coming to terms with what happened, how it happened and why, who benefited and what reparations can be made. If we in the United States truly want to live in a tolerant multicultural society that accommodates all and treats everyone with mutual respect, a civilization we have never had or known so one we cannot return to but one we must forge together with our eyes open, we must pursue a path of truth, reconciliation and restorative justice. It is certainly true that the Trump Administration is not the first openly and outwardly White Supremacist Government the United States has had. In fact it would be entirely reasonable and historically accurate to claim that every US Presidential Administration has been a White Supremacist Administration because no real effort has been made to come to terms with Amerikkka's past and present. The Trump Administration is, however, a fully awake White Supremacy feeling threatened and willing to fight for its survival no matter what. The open and obvious facticity of this alone means that Malcolm X was right over and over and over again. In the 54 years after his assassination, his position, his words regarding the truth of where power comes from and how power operates in Amerikkka and what liberation might require, how sweeping and wholesale a rethinking/remaking is necessary, is more true than ever. We must accept Malcolm's challenge to see beyond the immediate, to seek a larger and fuller and more complete understanding of ourselves and the the world we inhabit even and especially if that means remaking ourselves with that gathered wisdom, to never squander it, knowing how precious it is and how great its cost. I am not able to do this film justice and i honestly would not try but i urge you to see it if you haven't. May Peace Be With You, Blessed Be <3",9,malcolm-x-1992
85072,"#18 of 100 in my Top 100 Directors ChallengeI was pumped up for this film, which has been on my ""To Do"" list for at least three years. Directed by Billy Wilder and based upon a hit stage play by Agatha Christie, it was nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Editing and Sound Recording as well as Academy Award nominations for Charles Laughton as Best Leading Actor and Elsa Lanchester as Best Actress in a Supporting Role. It just had to be great, right?Well, there is certainly plenty to commend it. First off, Marlene Dietrich as Christine, the supposed wife of alleged murderer Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power), is a complete bitch, both in the courtroom and outside it, and while on the set the diva actress required an entire scene written, requiring 145 extras, 38 stunt men and $90,000 in order to show just one of her famous legs. Second, this was Power's last film before he died of an untimely heart attack at age 44.Then, there's Laughton as wily barrister Sir Wilfrid Roberts, portrayed as recovering from his own heart attack to defend Vole in court. I was surprised to learn that Laughton was married in real life to Lanchester, who played his nurse here, Miss Plimsoll. Ditsy widow Emily Jane French (Norma Varden) is the murder victim, attended by her elderly maid servant Janet MacKenzie (Una O'Connor). The judge at Old Bailey is played by Francis Compton, while John Williams is assistant defense counsel Brogan-Moore and Torin Thatcher is the Crown prosecutor Mr. Myers. Philip Tonge plays Chief Inspector Hearne, the arresting officer, and Ruta Lee is Diana, a young woman with a secret watching the trial.The strength of this story is in its surprise ending full of unexpected revelations. I can't say the twists were entirely unexpected, but they were well concealed. I've heard that may viewers confuse this for a Hitchcock film, which speaks highly of Wilder's ability to deliver mystery and suspense. But for me, it wasn't his best work -- just a cut below excellence.#84 among The IMDb Top 250 (June 2014)",6,witness-for-the-prosecution-1957

The second worse movie I’ve ever seen in my life (eraserhead is a tiny bit worse) this movie has nothing special to offer in the slightest bit. I can usually watch movies in one sitting but this took me an entire fuckin day! Every single character in this movie are fuckin cunts, with the most bland and lifeless performances I have ever laid my eyes upon. And this is supposed to be a romance? I’ve seen better romance in thor the dark fuckin world. What a fuckin wreckage of a fuckin movie this is. I was genuinely getting angry watching this because of how shit it was. The main storyline had me falling asleep, I could barely focus on what was actually happening… IF ANYTHING WAS FUCKING HAPPENING! I don’t care if the movie was made in 1940, the sound design in this film is absolutely revolting. It’s like listening too someone talk through a fuckin Nokia brick. The acting in this film is just pure and utter dogshit. Not a single moment did I feel any sympathy for any fuckin character in this movie, mostly based off of their wank performances. Terrible, disengaging dialogue. Nasty, ugly looking visuals. Oh let’s not forget Rick fucking Blaine!!!!!! What a shit protagonist!!! How the fuck did that girl even spend 2 seconds in a room with that silly bastard?!?! If it was me I would have fuckin slapped him up and down the room and threw him out of a fuckin skyscraper the cheeky cunt. His actions in this movie was just hard to watch him get away with, because of how much I fuckin hated him. The fuckin nobhead needed killing off, from the second he entered the screen. Imagine going out clubbing with him by the way? Could u just imagine it?! Holy fuck it’d be like talking to a fuckin downsyndrome. Whoever that fucking actor is in that movie, I hope he didn’t gain anything in life from that performance because that was horrific. I’ve seen better acting in Halloween resurrection.

60156,"Divided between my projected thoughts and felt experience, months and months of a haze of dissociation as I try to convince myself I'm doing fine. Art hasn't meant anything to me in a while. Not really. A crisis of self, catalyzed by recurring epiphanies and the mirage of linear growth. Remembering events like they happened to someone else, looking down from a third person point of view. A story half-remembered. Is this cyclical or absolute? I have memories of unqualified happiness, of being present. But it feels so distant. Searching for a reason, an explanation, a pattern. If I can just think my way out of this. If I could make the perfect piece of art. If I could make a masterpiece, express everything inside. But I have nothing to say, nothing worth saying. I've been here before, I know what this is, how to deal with it. So why is nothing working? As every false start reveals itself another piece of me breaks, another hope faded. Every day feels the same. I'm performing, always, endlessly. At work, at home, with friends, alone with my thoughts. Thinking what I should think and feeling what I should feel, but nothing connects. Yesterday I thought I had a moment. I cried for the first time in months, in the hope that maybe finally letting my frustration out might signify the end of this. But today I feel worse than I have in a long time. Defeated. Empty. I can do tasks, things that I know will be important to me later. So that's good. I can watch or listen to something and guess my own opinions, the art I'm sure will move me at a later date when things have come together. I'm even making things; I'm working on a project that I've wanted to do for years and it's going well. For once the songs in my head sound the same in real life.So why doesn't anything feel real...or exciting? How long have I felt this way and not realized? Was it a week ago? A year?

4678,"""What would you do if you only had six months to live?""Spoilers for Kung Fu PandaKanji Watanabe has been grinding away at the same job for almost thirty years, but while it may have brought him fulfillment in the past, now he keeps going merely in order to remain busy. He's not really living anymore, he's ""just killing time,"", so when he's diagnosed with stomach cancer and given less than a year to live, it's almost a formality. ""He's been dead for twenty years,"" the voiceover tells us, but while it's undeniably true that Watanabe had been living a non-life, being directly confronted with this fact in this way is traumatizing for him, and he desperately tries to reclaim his life. Here we see the psychoanalytic lesson taught to us by the obsessional neurotic, who continually performs the minimum necessary action for sustaining the status quo, constantly acting so that the real thing never happens. Watanabe is constantly doing the busywork of his job so that he doesn't have to face the difficult decisions presented to him, for example by the women who want sewage cleaned up to make a new park; he is ""killing time"" so that he doesn't ever have to really live. What this obsessional neurotic activity teaches us about the nature of subjectivity is that our deepest enjoyment is structurally deferred from us, that it is easier for us to feed the small desires and avoid the big one, and that facing the reality of our desire is traumatizing. The obsessional neurotic hides behind their constant (in)action because it protects them from making the scarier decisions. Watanabe does not actually enjoy this constant busywork that he compels himself to do, but the call to truly embrace his life, forced upon him by his diagnosis, is too traumatizing to confront directly. So what do we do about this psychological deadlock, wherein true enjoyment is foreclosed but the injunction to enjoy is traumatic, wherein we're unhappy but we're too unhappy to know how to become happy? Well, we go find some underworld kid to show us around the bars and brothers, of course! Watanabe encounters a young aspiring author who sees himself as a failure because of his laziness (oof, hard not to see myself there), and he begs this literary slacker to show him how to spend his money—or, in other words, to show him how to enjoy (his meager wealth). The younger man agrees to help, and over the course of their night together he repeatedly says, ""It is our duty to enjoy life,"" ""to be greedy for life."" He thereby occupies the position of the Superego, of the guilt-inducing imperative to ""enjoy whether you like it or not!"" Superego is essentially that voice telling us to make the most of everything, whether it's your boomer parents telling you to get off the couch and go DO something or your own internal monologue compelling you to capitalize on every little thing. Watanabe gets drunk with the writer, obeying the injunction to enjoy, but he doesn't seem particularly happy or revitalized about this radical change of pace—obeying the Superego is never deeply satisfying—so he eventually moves on to hanging out with Toyo, a young coworker who asks him for a favor. To Watanabe's eyes, Toyo is full of life: she's young, she's buoyantly energetic, and she laughs and smiles at just about everything. Through her, Watanabe feels alive again, but here he's only graduated from the Superego injunction to enjoy, to the Other who enjoys for him, who enjoys in his place. Here Watanabe has embraced ""interpassivity,"" the state in which he has deferred his happiness and enjoyment onto an Other, allowing for a kind of temporary and superficial satisfaction of his desire to enjoy life, allowing him to be passive while the Other is active. At his core, he's still unhappy, but as long as he spends all of his time with this young woman who is happy, then he can forget about his sadness. This overreliance weighs heavily upon Toyo who becomes exhausted by his need for constant companionship; their relationship is essentially parasitic, and Toyo eventually asks to be left alone. Before they part ways, however, Watanabe desperately inquires to Toyo what it is that makes her happy. ""I want to do something, I just don't know what,"" he whimpers. She responds that she doesn't do anything special, ""all I do is work and eat!"" There's no secret to happiness, or, perhaps more accurately, as we learn from Kung Fu Panda, there *is* a dragon scroll, but it's blank; it's not quite that there is no secret ingredient in secret ingredient soup, it's that the secret is that there is no secret. The secret to happiness is that there is no secret, there's just life; as Toyo says, there's just working and eating.The only difference between Watanabe and Toyo is that Toyo genuinely enjoys her work; as she remarks, she makes toys for children, and, ""Making them, I feel like I'm playing with every baby in Japan."" Here we finally see the difference between enjoying *through* the other, whereby Watanabe's happiness is displaced through his enjoyment of Toyo's happiness, and enjoying *for* the other, whereby Toyo takes a selfless vicarious pride in her work because it is making other people happy. This is the ultimate goal of the psychoanalytic process, precisely this move away from deferred enjoyment, away from happiness through the other and toward embracing your own desire as such. ""In the course of the psychoanalytic treatment, the subject has to learn to accept directly his relationship to the object which gives body to his jouissance."" So Watanabe returns to work, now with renewed vigor. He decides to take on the project of clearing out the sewage to make room for a new park. He observes the fruits of his labor from a distance, comforted in his understanding that this is happiness, this is life.

39273,"Call this the “Tokyo Story Effect”. The disappointment after watching this film is extra. Knowing Kore-eda is similar to Ozu (as the influence is more than clear), the best comparison is the Tokyo Story experience, as the tale regarding family dynamics should connect with me on a large and vast level, but is let down by both the acting and the static direction. Still Walking is no more beautiful than a series of glorious food images (which I deeply enjoyed) interjected between a family who is maybe the least interesting bunch of people I’ve seen since Tokyo Story.The calming nature of the film goes against the dynamic payload it wishes to unveil by the end. The direction is incredibly axial, working on mostly horizontal levels, hyper-focusing on the lackluster interactions between those in the family. While I’d say the acting in Tokyo Story is worse, credit was provided in my rating to assure I recognized it’s value and contribution to cinema’s history. Still Walking does not have that grace working for itself. My enjoyment from Kore-eda’s direction and the overall product of Still Walking, is the smaller tucked away moments in between all of the character interactions. The close-ups of homemade cooking did send me barreling back in nostalgia to all the times I watched either grandmother cook. Even the small bits of zaniness found in transition work way better than the drama Kore-era focuses on when the camera remains still. Here’s to hoping I can “get” Kore-eda on a future watch. Unfortunately, I definitely let some friends down since this was a recommendation. On paper, this should have worked for me, but sometimes things just don’t work out!",3,still-walking
27773,"(...And I was inspired by a flawless film yet again. So, I wrote this short thingy...)_________________________________Sunny Finley had never felt as strange as the day she woke up and grasped she was going to die. It was a Monday, blue as ever, and her uncombed hair looked heavier than it actually was, or so she thought when she visited the mirror. Suddenly she knew.‘I have but three days to live,’ she whispered to her reflection, at which the reflection mimicked her movements and whispered the same words back. What she first thought of as merely but inexplicably exhilarating, she grew to find rather daunting. She did not tell her wife, she did not tell her family, and well, she was hardly committed to leave her ponderous room. In this present state, Sunny Finley now worried, afraid of dying too fast with a frown too sad. She wished, prayed, begged not to die with a hideous frown. All but that.‘Made some veggies today at work,’ her wife said that Monday night, as she confined the veggies into a small, plastic box with the name Ivana on it. Sunny tried to make sense of the words, but when you know you’re dying, you do not care about vegetables.‘Snatched that Japanese drink too, the one you like. The machine broke down, can you believe that?’She believed it alright, yet she did not have the strength to even bother replying.On Tuesday she went out on the street, slouching her arms down as if they were numb. There walked Sunny Finley, a dying woman, though not diagnosed. It came up to her that maybe this big idea was like a booger; if you want to get rid of it, remove it. But how could she remove the idea of dying, when she was fairly sure about the accuracy of her premonition?Sunny Finley could perceive her death, but wanted nothing of it. It was Wednesday when she started to cry uncontrollably, like a newborn baby. Once she settled with the idea of death, she wished to have loosened up a bit. Unfortunately she did not. At six, her wife returned with yet another story about work. Sunny Finley tried to listen, but she lost that fight to her vicious thoughts. It took some time for her wife to settle for a goodnight sleep, only for Sunny to finally continue weeping again. And she wept through the night, waiting for death to pick her up. She frowned until she fell asleep.Thursday morning met with no chirping birds, but instead with a long glance in the mirror. The three days had passed. Sunny Finley stared into the soul of her mirrored self, speechless as one would be after surviving death. Tears had gone, and her face had purchased a brand new smile. Why had she worried in the first place? She persevered that big smile in the midst of all her disbelief, as the Thursday rolled by smoothly. She smiled all day, she smiled at dinner, and even when Sunny Finley peacefully passed away in her sleep later that night, there was not a single frown visible, no, she had smiled instead.",9,eternity-and-a-day

It's one of those animated films that perfectly uses its style to heighten a story that wouldn't work as well in the realm of live-action. It's about a multitude of themes, too many to count, from friendship, mental illness, ambition, love, racism, family... Its claymotion look is deceiving, for this is a very mature story, albeit with some really strong comedic elements in its clever visuals and editing.At its core, this is an emotional story, a friendship between a young Aussie girl and a mentally-ill New Yorker that is used as a mirror to our society. It's the type of film that is so earnest, good intentioned, and sweet that it's hard not to fall in love with it after the first 10 minutes. The use of narration and voice-over is quite clever, and there are plenty of stylistic flourishes with the cinematography, sound and use of color that kept the story and environments to get stale.Definitely a must-watch in the realm of animation and cinema in general.

58630,"Wow, fuck why didn't I see this movie earlier. I knew I would love it, but not that much.Dead Poets Society is so beautifully told and so incredibly emotional. I have rarely, maybe never, felt so safe and protected in a film. The cast alone speaks for itself - such great actors and all so convincing in their roles. For the whole 128 minutes I was literally caught up in the school and so close to the characters. The whole setting, the soundtrack, the dialogue and the ideas are perfect. And with Peter Weir, the perfect director has been found. So many of the impressive scenes are stuck in my head and will never leave. Two even brought tears to my eyes and the last scene left me speechless. I am so happy to have found a new Comfort film that I will watch extremely often, especially in autumn. 100 percent recommendation from me.",9,dead-poets-society
8574,"Autumn Sonata relies so much on emotion and yet this highly praised film (#47 highest rated feature on Letterboxd at the time of this posting) by Ingmar Bergman had very little effect on me. I promise I'm not a soulless human being. I just had a very tough time connecting with these characters. The storytelling mechanics here are mainly a recounting of the past in order to bring about truth. This is done through monologues and brief flashbacks. Sven Nykvist knows how to frame a face, but I feel like his talents were incredibly limited to just that. The issue is that I was overwhelmed by the characters talking about their unresolved problems with each other. I know Ingmar Bergman is the king of monologues, but I just didn't feel anything from them this time. While the performances are incredible, I needed something that could be visually explored in real time. For me, that's where the emotion comes from. There is a really great moment where Liv Ullmann's character watches Ingrid Bergman's character play the piano. Subtle feelings are fully realized by Liv's silent performance and Nykvist's camera work. This was the best part of the film, and I wanted more of that.I'll give Autumn Sonata another try at some point. We all experience films differently, and I know some people love this movie for how it makes them feel.Ingmar Bergman Ranked",6,autumn-sonata

64887,"One of the defining films of the Czechoslovakia New Wave of the 60s, Juraj Herz’s blistering The Cremator is political satire, morbid gothic horror and pitch black comedy all at once. There is so much going on in Herz’s film formally and contextually that is hard to encapsulate it in one review. Technically, the film is a bold and disorientating blend of avant-garde technique. It’s a deeply disturbing work but one that also dazzles because of its compelling images, creative editing and an absolutely superb lead performance but a hard one to handle specially for me specially in this spooky season.",4,the-cremator
15209,"Then intended to be the final film of Ingmar Bergman's career, Fanny & Alexander finds the influential Swedish director bringing all the themes he's addressed throughout his filmmaking journey into a semi-autobiographical account of his upbringing and he delivers a sprawling family epic that envelops its cold core with a radiating warmth.The story opens with a Christmas party that silently acquaints us with all the family members but it is only after the kids find themselves in a new environment that the drama becomes truly gripping. Bergman paints the lives of his characters in simple brushstrokes but still sprinkles the central storyline with mystical elements that add more layers to an otherwise straightforward narrative.The splendid locations, detailed set pieces, fluid camerawork & beautiful lighting play their part to help uplift the imagery and the ensemble cast embrace their respective roles so well that the familial bonding between them has a genuine & authentic feel to it. Ewa Fröling is a definite standout but contributions from the rest are almost as impressive. The film's 188 mins runtime however is strongly felt on more occasions than one.Overall, Fanny & Alexander is amongst Ingmar Bergman's more accessible works and is sure to delight his fans & followers with its sumptuous production & graceful storytelling. Through this saga of a single family, it captures life, tragedy, love, loss, magic, reality, ghosts, memory, miracles & religion. And while I found the first hour to be a slog, the drama does get better with the change in scenery & the clashes that ensue. Still, for me, this film is more a tick mark on the checklist than anything else.",5,fanny-and-alexander
28763,"Unpopular opinion ⬇️I generally avoid blockbusters, but my bro recommended this and I felt I owed him one. After nearly three grueling hours (it felt like an eternity), I must say this disappointed. I expected an emotional sci-fi, which is the kind of film I usually love, but this fell short for me. Intriguing premise, poor execution imo. The 4.3/5 Letterboxd rating blows my mind, honestly. The smartest-sounding stupidity ever. I know you have to suspect disbelief to a degree with movies like this, but this was just silly. Things really fell apart in the third act. While I understand it, I was hoping for a more straightforward story about finding a new planet for humanity. Instead, it was a big mess with too many twists and turns. The water planet scenes were great. I wish there was more of that stuff. Matthew McConaughey’s orange skin (bad spray tan?) that matched his daughter’s hair was distracting. What was that about? I Googled it and I’m not the only one that noticed. I believe that almost any film can/should be edited down to 2 hours or less, and this movie is a prime example. Midsommar has a similar runtime but it doesn’t FEEL super long. THIS one does. On the plus side, every famous actor is in it. That was probably half the budget. Anne Hathaway’s speech about love was so cringe, and the fact that she ended up being right just shows how goofy it all is. The Matt Damon villain subplot was super lame.I knew he’d reunite with his daughter in the end, but goddamn that was the most anticlimactic piece of shit reunion of all time. They acted like they’d just seen each other last week. She hadn’t seen her father in more than half a century, and all we got was some casual talk and then her basically telling him, “Fuck off and go find Anne Hathaway.” Like what!? Oh and in typical Hollywood fashion, everyone lives happily ever after.…I can’t personally recommend this.",4,interstellar

26565,"Hopefully this doesn’t doesn’t get my cinephile card revoked, but I wasn’t entirely on board with this here venerated masterpiece of slow cinema. Full disclosure, I watched this in sittings and if you don’t count godly Twin Peaks: The Return or the epic war film The Human Experience as single films, this was the longest film I’ve seen. It wasn’t it’s slowness or it’s unwieldily 7+ hour runtime that deterred me though. I have a genuine love for more than a few films that fall in this oft misunderstood genre. From Tsai to Kiarostami to Tarkovsky to Bresson, the calmness and formal innovation make these films a meditation on the world and humanity’s place within it. I didn’t get that with this film. Instead, the miserable outlook of Tarr and crew overwhelms everything. Tarr’s style takes the aesthetics of Tarkovsky and Angoloupolis and the pessimist philosophy of a Hanake or a Herzog. It’s inarguably well crafted purely from a mood based perspective. And there are some brilliant and entrancing moments that will stick with me for a long time. The cows being shepherded to their death and the two separate apocalyptic shots of following men walking down the street strike an otherworldly tone that is downright Lynchian. Plus the textures and rotting landscapes shown are startling in their detail. But these moments are far and few between. Instead of eliciting contemplation, allowing me to get cozy in the recesses of the tepid pacing, it felt like Tarr was more interested in torturing the viewers than allowing us to participate in the atmosphere.  (Speaking of torture, I might be a dog person, but I’m definitely not a fan of the cat torturing here.) And I’m ashamed to admit I had to fast forward through the final accordion music scene. I just couldn’t take that 30 second loop for another FIVE minutes, sorry.But where this somewhat overlong opus holds weight is it’s sharp political philosophy. The general plot (which is surprisingly simple given the literary recursive structure) follows a Hungarian village at the end of communism and the presumed dead former villager and con-artist that uses the chaotic economic change to manipulate and control them. It echos what happens in politics time and time again. People lose one kind of oppression/corruption, desperate for stability, can’t help but run into the greedy arms of another kind of oppression. This has been displayed recently with the growing alt-right and authoritarian movements around the world (You may have heard of someone named Donald).  But Tarr and Hungary have been experiencing this authoritarian regime for decades, which makes its depiction of the self interested huckster so much more venomous. I just wish the crafting of this political allegory wasn’t so flatly bland and nihilistic.This was my first experience with Tarr. It wasn’t really by design, but I wanted to jump into his filmography and the only other film available on Kanopy was his swan song, The Turin Horse, which didn’t seem like the best entry point. From my experience with this film though, I feel he lacks a certain magic of Tarkovsky or the other slow cinema greats. Still, I gather his other films drift more into surrealism and metaphor that made me fall in love with the works of Tsai or Lynch. So while this was my first experience with this prickly pear, Bela Tarr, I won’t make it my last. But I AM taking a break. A LONG break....added to: VISUAL NOVELS",4,satantango
45354,"Werckmeister Harmonies is a film that I don't hate, but I don't love. The imagery is haunting, the soundtrack is so beautiful it makes your heart ache, and many moments left me speechless. However, I also found the film to be overly-long and slow, with the story and characters failing to connect on any level. Honestly, the film feels like a wonderful failure, one that surpasses any expectations on the technical side, but completely underwhelms on the emotional spectrum. The Awesome: The imagery, the soundtrack, the riot sequence, the first witness of the whale. Honestly, the visuals and sound gave the film 2 and a half stars right out of the gate. The Terrible: Tedious, achingly slow, even downright boring at times.  The emotional payoff would be incredible if we actually found these characters fascinating or interesting.

61044,"In terms of themes, this movie isn't really doing anything new by modern standards. It’s major talking points have been explored since, but this was the starting point. This film was honestly pretty ballsy with what it was willing to discuss. As a history buff, there were multiple scenes where I was genuinely shocked by how far it went. Considering it was an American film, at least. I'm also glad that it made use of some genuinely great editing techniques and camera tricks. There were these oner shots that would circle around characters as they gave testimonies. There were some very clever uses of zooms as well. The acting is great across the board, obviously, but it was unsurprisingly Burt Lancaster who delivered my favorite performance. What's even more surprising is that he did this while speaking very little throughout the film (although he does have a fantastic speech in the 3rd act). He actually managed to transform into his character incredibly well in a career of fantastic characters. It may not be my favorite of his, but it is definitely the most surprising. I guess what kept this from fully hitting me was my rather distant attachment to our main character. I would unfortunately go as far as to say that he's the least interesting out of all the characters. Not a knock against Spencer Tracy, however. There are also some 60s-isms, like some over-acting, bizarre dubbing, and some bad green screens. I still felt the intended emotions and genuinely loved most of the film. It's incredibly well-paced and managed to be one of the better courtroom movies I've seen. Perhaps I'll soften on its central character in the future.",6,judgment-at-nuremberg

45637,"If you’re not interested in politics - and specifically soviet history - or art films in general then I do not recommend this at all. But if you do, I can’t recommend it enough. But that would be misguiding a bit, as this film doesn’t deal with history as such, but it deals with it at an arms length, preferring to convey the emotional zeitgeist of communist Hungary but still in a surreal way that doesn’t present a neat roman a clef that unlocks this story. Tarr is not concerned with conveying what really happened, but conveying instead what what happened felt like, setting himself within the artistic tradition of expressionism.The dreamy black and white and long takes suck you into that mood that also facilitates consuming the story and film in such a way as well. And it also helps to convey the message and ideas it has about the political condition. Of the farce that is state oppression, with the promises it gives of a cleaner society, and how real human interest lies not with that, but in exacting military order and doing that through psychological and physical humiliation and violence. After all, the people who keep saying that a mysterious band of no-gooders “come in and break everything and burn everything” are the same people who commit those crimes towards the end of the film, who are the people of the town itself. As if the shroud of a communist security state is merely an excuse for one neighbor to exact total revenge on his other neighbor. The wife against the husband. etc.It’s unclear where the serious expressionistic deconstruction ends and the satirical comedic fun begins. This film is funny, in a deadpan way. Tarr is dreamy but precise enough to keep you engaged. As languidly paced as this film is, I still have it on a list of rewatches because it is just that great.

88181,"A gorgeous film about love and exile, Wong Kar-Wai's Happy Together examines two people depending on each other while separated from their home country and displaced on the other side of the world. A quieter film in both tone and action, Happy Together starts with a real bang of eroticism but quickly dissolves into a much more delicate character study on our protagonist, his lover, and the characters that revolve around them. This is an exceptional film in many ways, but as a cultural cornerstone and widely discussed as one of, if not the, greatest Asian films depicting queer romance, it is a triumph alone. I thought I would have enjoyed the more kinetic approach that Wong Kar-Wai's other films had, such as the blurred camerawork or play with music we get in films like Chungking Express and Fallen Angels, but on reflection, I think this more subdued approach had me more invested in our central characters and in the toxic relationship that existed between them. This seems to show a different, more controlled directorial hand, and ultimately seems to pave the way for Wong Kar-Wai's more confident works like In the Mood for Love. Overall, I really enjoyed it and will look forward to revisiting it in the future to examine the themes of marginalization and social/cultural/political exile that the film explores. I feel like it has a lot of wonderful things happening on the surface, but may also be hiding more just beneath it. On the whole, a great addition to Wong Kar-Wai's larger canon. 83%",7,happy-together-1997

There's plenty to appreciate from a filmmaking perspective (the camera-work, sets, and acting are all very impressive), but nothing interested me from a narrative stand-point. Many of the themes and characters impressed me while watching, especially how each character had a very distinct perspective and world-view. Stellar analysis of religion too. But I've said it time and time again, for me to like a movie, it has to intrigue or entertain me in some way; Andrei Rublev failed at that. It's story was told in the most uninteresting way possible (to me at least), and it left me bored for a lot of the time.I don't know, maybe if it was told from a more focused perspective I would've liked it more. All the shifts in who we were following (particularly at the end) took me out of a lot of it. A re-watch is warranted later in life, but I don't know if I see myself liking it more. I am interested in exploring the rest of Tarkovsky's filmography though.

British accent, Russian accent, French accent, Nebraska accent, John Mills shows up for 10 minutes doing an Australian accent for some reason? Who cares. Throw it all in. What’s crazy is that it feels like a competent movie. King Vidor is a legitimately great director. The cinematography makes you feel like you’re watching a movie of substance.

Although twelve military tribunals were held in Nuremberg, this is more of a fictionalized account, even though it feels very real.

61204,"The Night of the Hunter is quite a curious film. It basically operates on two different tonal levels. Obviously as a noir thriller there's the almost horror movie moments of fear, and this is where the movie really excels. The shadows are dark and menacing, the soundtrack is ominous and threatening, and Robert Mitchum's performance as Harry Powell is as mysterious and alluring as it is eerie and haunting. As a horror-spiked crime thriller it really is a forgotten masterpiece (well, not forgotten anymore, but unappreciated in its time).The second tonal level is where the film fell short for me and where I began to understand why it wasn't understood on its release. Against the evil of Mitchum's antagonist, the film contrasts the innocence and innate goodness of children. The contrast is effective, but a lot of these moments were simply too much for me. The message was too obvious, or the sweetness was too saccarine, but in any case they didn't work on an immediate emotional level.There's also an interesting facet of the movie which has something to say about religion. The antagonist is a preacher and often twists Christian dogma to serve his questionable morality, and I think it really gets at some of the interesting conflicts within the religion. In particular, it examines the violence of love and how an uncompromising or authoritarian approach to religion can be dangerous.Definitely recommended to fans of Robert Mitchum or anyone looking for a unique film noir.",5,the-night-of-the-hunter

2887,"Parasite (1982) is Demi Moore's first film and is available on YouTube. The storyline takes place in an apocalyptic future where food and resources are rare. A scientist infected with the results of his experiments flees his lab and is hunted down by a government bounty Hunter of sorts. The scientist tries to hide in a town and find the cure putting the townspeople at risk.This movie is directed by Charles Band (Puppetmaster) and stars Robert Glaudini (Bugsy), Demi Moore (Striptease), Luca Bercovici (Frightmare), James Davidson (The Mechanic) and Tom Villard (Popcorn).I loved this movie. The opening breakout scene is great followed by the topless security guard and rattlesnake scene. Seeing a young Demi Moore was fun. The special effects were way better than I anticipated and the kill scenes have well down gore. The 3D jump scare elements were fun too.Overall this is way better than the reviews indicate and an underrated gem. I would score this a solid 7.5/10 and recommend watching it.",6,parasite

26231,"Today was my second attempt at watching David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.  Luckily I was able to finish it.  The first time I attempted to watch this 227 minute epic was sometime last year.  I got through the first disc which is approximately 2 hours and 20 minutes long only to not be able to finish the film due to the 2nd disc being scratched and basically unplayable.  Needless to say I was pretty pissed off.  I'd just spent a good portion of the day watching disc 1 of a film that is much longer than your average film and wasn't able to finish it.  The length and the fact I had to start from the beginning is what kept me from getting back to it until today.  I'm glad I've finally seen this classic which won 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture in 1962, but the excruciating runtime, and plot which I liked but didn't love will keep me from seeing again for a very long time.Lawrence of Arabia is the dramatic portrait of famed British officer T.E. Lawrence's journey to the Middle East.  The eccentric officer, assigned to Arabia during WWI, couragously unites the warring Arab factions into a strong guerrilla front and leads them to miraculous victories on treacherous desert battlefields, where they eventually defeat the ruling Turkish Empire.This is a long film, and I felt every minute of it's length.  It's not because it was boring or because I didn't like it but more because I had little interest in the plot.  Don't get me wrong, it's a very good film.  It just didn't live up to its 7 Academy Award wins for me.  I'm not saying it's not deserving, I'm sure it was at the time, it's just not the type of film that appeals to me enough to rate it in accordance with it's reputation.  That doesn't mean I don't understand it's classic status and critical acclaim, trust me I do, it's just not going to be a personal favorite of mine.Despite it not being my cup of tea per se, I can certainly appreciate David Lean's wonderful direction and Peter O'Toole's excellent lead performance.  Lean's film is an epic, and it certainly felt like one.  From the sprawling desert landscapes to the lovely overture that opens and closes the film, Lean created an excellent piece of work.  His star, O'Toole, is perfect as Lawrence, and he's surrounded by a nice cast that includes Alec Guinness, Anthony Quinn, Jack Hawkins, Jose Ferrer, and Anthony Quayle, among others.  One of my biggest issues involved the cast though.  The majority of this film takes place in Arabia with Arabs, but everyone speaks perfect English.  I know it was commonplace back in the day for English speaking actors to play characters from non-English speaking countries, but it kinda took me out of it a little bit.  Literally everyone speaks English, which is just plain silly.  I'm not even sure the accents were accurate, but I can't say for sure.  Either way I found that aspect  of the film's production a bit bothersome.Outside of my gripe with the casting and spoken language in the film, I can confidently say it's extremely well made and acted.  It's a long film to sit through, but, considering it's praise, it seems most people don't mind the length at all.  Personally I don't see myself taking the plunge again anytime soon, but I think it's a film everyone should see at some point in their life.Ron's recommendation: See it.",6,lawrence-of-arabia
61642,"saw this at the theatre and i honestly don’t regret it because i wouldn't have finished this otherwise. pulp fiction is insanely boring and relies on cheap racial provocations and stereotypes to maintain momentum. what’s interesting is how often tarantino preemptively absolves himself of scrutiny for the racist humour here. he frames a scene so the audience laughs when a shop owner says “take your foot off the n*gger.” tarantino then immediately chastises them by having the shop owner and his cop adjacent buddy r*pe a black dude. in typical aimless provocateur fashion, tarantino includes a r*pe joke later on, forgetting that he used r*pe as a device to condemn the bad racists. the audience is meant to laugh when tarantino exclaims that he does not store “dead n*ggers” in his garage—as an aside: the people who are upset that tarantino himself said these lines but don’t question why they would be okay with him having someone else say the exact same lines, in the exact same trivialised context, give me a headache—then interpret it as racial commentary when it is revealed that his character’s wife is black (isn’t it crazy that people with black partners are sometimes secretly racist?). in doing so, he also absolves the audience of responsibility for their reactions; should they feel bad for enjoying meaningless racial provocations, tarantino has them covered with unsubtle yet similarly meaningless allusions to racial anxieties in america. that makes pulp fiction so much worse than if it really was just tarantino dropping the n-word 100 times.",0,pulp-fiction

The Joker is our sole perpetuator of ""anarchy"", a self-described ""agent of chaos"". He is merely a criminal, with no visible desire to carry out any plans remotely related to the trademark traits of anarchist theory. It's an inherently cynical film, one that assumes its audience is too stupid or just doesn't care enough about the subject at hand to take five minutes and unearth any semblance of legitimate anarchist theory that would defy the film's one-sided, myopic view of the ideology.This is by no means to say that those who like the film are stupid, nor careless - there are certainly a number of things to be admired in TDK.

60282,"Whenever an artist strikes creative gold, it sometimes becomes difficult for them to finally separate themselves from the goldmine when its resources have run dry. For someone like Hideaki Anno, this inability to move on from the title that made him a household name in the realm of Japanese animation feels less like the desire to milk a cash cow dry and more like an indication that such an emotionally and psychologically charged series as Neon Genesis Evangelion still had some ground to cover within the psyche of its self-reflexive creator. So, about one year removed from my first exposure to his seminal anime series, the time felt right to work my way through the famed Rebuild of Evangelion saga that began over 10 years after its source show ended. The result was once again an emotional rollercoaster, but perhaps not so much in the way that Anno had anticipated.Things began on the rough side with You Are (Not) Alone, which acts as a straightforward retelling of the first few episodes of the show. In some ways, this feels like essential setup for what's to come, but as its own film, this kickoff feels rather pointless as, if anything new was added to this iteration, it wasn't significant enough to stand out. Not only does this film keep the events of the show unchanged, but it also maintains that quick pacing which, while suitable for 20-minute episodes that go beyond an initial 6, feels entirely rushed for one two-hour movie.You Can (Not) Advance is probably the best entry of this 4-part tale, for while some of the adjustments to the original series seem misguided (cutting down the legendary elevator interaction to near-nothingness is unforgivable!), there are enough entirely new additions that still feel in line with the overall narrative. In this way, the film—unlike You Are (Not) Alone—justifies its existence as a separate piece from its inspiration, while also making sense within the established universe, building excitement for what's to come. Anno's risk-taking makes a huge leap with You Can (Not) Redo, very much living up to its title by finally taking the series in an entirely new direction with a significant time-jump. Here, the shifting of character arcs is an intriguing idea, but for the most part, these new changes serve mainly to confuse, and ultimately, while this change in direction may be more appreciated than simply retelling the original story beat-for-beat, this adjusted narrative doesn't feel like much of an improvement. Worst of all, this time-jump forces us to abandon interesting teenage relationships that were the crux of what made the show so special. The final film tries to make up for that by exploring the sense of displacement, but the results are, again, a massive downgrade.Finally, we get to Thrice Upon a Time, which fully cements my gut-feeling that Anno, with these last two films diverging so wildly from Neon Genesis, was simply making new shit up as he went along. By this point, the changes foretold in You Can (Not) Redo take form in ways that are (like its predecessor) simply not as appealing as what they're replacing, making for a head-scratching experience. End of Evangelion and especially the final two episodes of the show that it  complemented were also fairly confusing in their headiness, but Thrice Upon a Time draws its convolution not from Shinji or Gendo's complex characterization, but rather from the storyline that never clearly establishes the stakes or what any of these ""impacts"" actually mean. Thrice Upon a Time is pretty emblematic of my issues with the Rebuild Series overall, as it at once makes wild changes to the storyline that are too perplexing to be engaging and adheres to the established formula in places where changes would have actually been appreciated. In no place is this dichotomy more apparent than the climax, in which the real-world action becomes a constant pile-on of newly introduced setbacks and solutions that are treated as though they had been properly established the whole time, while the emotional/cerebral conflict that Shinji must finally overcome feels like a sluggish retread of the finale we already got 25 years earlier. It's easy to imagine that such a hefty undertaking took its emotional and physical toll on Hideaki Anno (with a 9-year gap between the latter two installments). Hopefully, that means that Anno is finally ready to put the Evangelion story behind him once and for all, because if Thrice Upon a Time and the Rebuild Series as a whole are indicative of anything, it’s that this narrative has run its course. The consequence of this Fourth Impact was little more than frustration.2021 Ranked.",5,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time

The film’s strength rests on its second half when its thematic address starts to take a formidable shape - a significant contrast to its wayward initial half. Roberto Benigni brings a great deal of energy to his performance, the like that parallels him to the great comics of the silent era, and undoubtedly it manages to catch our eyes and hold our attention. However, Benigni’s hand in direction fails to glue the entire thing together, leaving forth a bit of a mess in its episodic structure. The storytelling recalls the form of Jacques Tati, an assembly of gags and characters that when taken as a whole feed onto a much larger theme. Life Is Beautiful finds itself leaning towards the great comedies that have inspired Benigni, only to, unfortunately, find itself falling completely over rather than landing safely on its feet.",4,life-is-beautiful

This film's thesis is about the weight of choice under our material and historically situated constraints. Including our choice to love as a choice to sacrifice ourselves. In Juxian's first scene with Duan, she literally leaps from a high balcony and (somehow) lands easily in his arms (I assume this is covered in opera troupe training). As a historical film, this movie delights in juxtaposition.  When Cheng and Duan sit and lean against the royal eunuch who once molested Cheng as a child, now a senile beggar, as the communists raid the city..... Woof For better or worse, we are microscopicly focused on these 3 characters. The audience is on the periphery of these changes, we are as isolated as our protagonists until conflict comes to the front door. One last thing. Def some tragic queer stereotypes here but.

The story of a young Japanese woman battling the idea of getting married to keep taking care of her father is at once a heartwarming view of dedication to ones self and the people that surround them and a reminder of the necessity of break out of the mold of safety and not be afraid of change. They are simple concepts but nonetheless eternally worthwhile lessons that keep their power for many generations to come. Thereby, thanks to the immaculate framing of the already claustrophobic houses, the intimacy of these common lives are made even more immersive. Once again the placing of the camera in-between characters during a dialogue-scene makes you, in a certain way, a part of the conversation.

I feel like something they focused on a lot more in this film was purpose, and truly having a reason to fight and keep going. Whilst pertaining that purpose there is also the affect of ones tenacity, mainly associating with the character Obara. Just a character with a lot of self doubt, and lack of support. He's the catalyst to where Kaji ends up at the end of this film, as in his military position, and also his mental position.    There honestly is so much to praise about this film, Just a masterpiece in Anti-War cinema; from the standpoint of violence, but also the interconnecting's of militant operations and how they function and treat others who are classified lower than them. Extreme power trips for people that we quite literally see cower in fear in the face of actual danger. Driving recruits to their lowest mentally just to finally have some control over their lives, due to their limited time being on the losing end of a war.    The main gripe I do have with this film happens to also be the main one I had with the first one, and that's the fact that it feels like it goes in circles for almost two hours. Yes circumstances change, but it still just feels like Kaji starts somewhere 'high' then is beaten and battered down to a lower level to the point where he loses himself.

27574,"Nobody Knows is the fictional account of a real life case of criminal negligence, yet it's constructed as the most touching, sensitive and intuitive tribute to children’s endless potential, resilience and creativity that could possibly be depicted on film. There is something saddening about the words nobody knows; they imply a splendid metropolis of light and magic can't be of any help. This is a film where anytime an adult (not just the mother!) makes a choice - it contributes to the children's further neglect; anytime a shot lingers over a suitcase or a squeaky shoe for a second too long is an urgent plea to forget all rules and formalities and just help. But simply simmering in misery serves nothing, and it's not the story Koreeda wanted to tell when he invested so much love, time and resources into encouraging these four precious child actors into becoming a fictional family that understands each other at a glance. His purpose was to show that children are open and accepting, they feel a need to right the wrong and they would secretly and selflessly give their siblings Christmas presents when mom failed to do so.What I enjoy about Koreeda’s films is that they move very well and they leave a lot to the imagination, because the most important actions happen offscreen - there is more purpose to every scene than just documenting a meal, a bottle of nail polish or 12-year-old Akira sprinting down the street - it's actually the emotional centrepiece of the film. Koreeda keeps track of time without a clock; seasons come and seasons go, the crayons get smaller, the plants outgrow their beds; money runs out. It’s not meant to be a “complete” film that offers a solution or a different home; instead, it feels like a cloud upon all moods and emotions are suspended. It's my impression that Japanese art is traditionally composed in this open-ended manner; however, there's a uniquely fluid and breezy quality about Koreeda's films that shines as I watch them in the clarity of daylight - and I saw Nobody Knows on such a strange morning of heavy spring snow, I will have to remember it.",8,nobody-knows

As I write this, I am still wiping tears from my eyes.A lot of my emotional response to this film has to do with my personal experience. If you've seen these films, then you know that Apu deals with an incredible amount of grief throughout the course of them. Having lost both my parents before the age of 24, I so relate to the internal struggle Apu goes through; that repression of one's deep sadness because no one else will fully understand.'Apur Sansar' features Apu's unlikely marriage and how it truly changes him as a human being. As much as the film's ending really gut-punched me, I think my favorite section of the film was the couple's early married life. Soumitra Chatterjee as Apu and Sharmila Tagore as Aparna are just electric as the cross-footed couple who eventually develop fondness and love. Aparna has as deep an inner life as Apu, but she plays little tricks on him to make her emotional ends meet, and this ends up being the best courtship Apu could have hoped for. A scene later in the film where one of Apu's coworkers laments his wife's agreeable nature made me smile just thinking about the earlier scenes with Aparna and how Ray so perfectly captures what real romance is.Every scene and nearly every frame of this thing was nearly a spiritual experience for me. There is an earnest, humorous bluntness that exists in these films that somehow blends with a supremely delicate touch to create true movie magic.

44441,"[54]Ten minutes in and I was certain I was watching my least favorite film ever. Turns out Tarkovsky-doing-Bergman is somehow worse than Bergman alone, if only because I’m hyperaware of the ephemeral ambience and visual splendors being stifled in lieu of droning literary passages. Listen, if I wanted to read a book, I’d just read a goddamn book. Having someone else essentially reading a book to me is, among other things, a shortsighted use of the medium; backgrounding it with a ten-minute unbroken shot near a lowly shoreside’s only tree doesn’t abridge that reservation, either, no matter how gorgeous the scenery may inherently be. (I understand there’s a market for this ilk of movie, it simply isn’t for me.) Little did I realize, though, that Tarkovsky’s rambling could rival Bergman’s when cranked up to eleven; adding a conveniently mute boy to whom the father can talk doesn’t make the device any less of a lame excuse for one director’s self-absorbed lesson in unchallenged philosophy. (Or religious extremism, if you prefer.) Tark loosens up a bit after that dreadful opening and while the diatribes never truly cease, they are at least decorated by a more flavorful aestheticism e.g. the black-and-white flashbacks through desolate, wartorn remnants, or the beautiful pan that captures buildings reflected in a puddle beneath blood and tarnished garments. Remained bored stiff at the theatrically staged dining room farce - funny enough, and somewhat paradoxically, the more a director chooses to verbalize their thesis, the less intuitive it becomes - but started getting excited when it seemed like Tarkovsky was finally venturing into cognitive drama, even mild surrealism. (The spilling pitcher of milk accurately marks a huge turning point in my overall interest.) Gagged at some of the ensuing, lingering Bergmanisms - the feinting father, the hysterical wife - but was eventually won over by the switch to a painterly lyricism. The burning home might be Tark’s single greatest set piece, achieving massive symbology with relative simplicity and bringing previously hypothetical themes to devastatingly literal ends in the most dazzling way possible. Gave myself a migraine trying to reverse engineer a justification for the trudging first-half once the epic finale commenced. Couldn’t make it happen, alas, and I’m forced to acknowledge this as a 50/50 compromise of the things I both love and hate about Tarkovsky abutted side by side. Concluding on “the good stuff” leaves a lingering impression that’s more favorable than not, but I mustn’t forget how torturously this began.",5,the-sacrifice

8905,"Cinema is a hobby and a passion. It's a projection of life and completes many of ours lives. Or at least it makes life more meaningful, teaches us about ourselves and the world, allows us to experience moments of pure magic. Cinema is part of life's cycle as it keeps evolving and lets people take a stand on important subjects. It tells stories of history, present and future like no other medium does combining sound and moving pictures. It isn't just a compilation of these things, it isn't just a valued form of art, it definitely isn't just a large multibillion dollar industry. Cinema is more than words can describe but I have only one word: emotions. What you feel, where, why and how you feel it. Is it a reserved or euphoric happiness? Nostalgic or melancholic sadness? Disgust, confusion, excitement, admiration, passion, love. No other artform is able to evoke such visceral and frequent emotional responses in me than movies.It's unfortunate and somewhat ironic though that a film about embracing the love for cinema and how personally it projects our lives didn't move me. Despite Morricone's score, Salvatore Cascio and Philippe Noiret's performances and the warm, welcoming tone Cinema Paradiso was disappointing. It's gloated with melodrama and sugary, fuzzy aftertaste that follows every scene. Tornatore is more interested in emphasizing these overblown feelings than he is about staying true to the characters to evoke emotions naturally. Which sometimes works but unfortunately these characters are left in their hollow shells and all the excitement that is achieved shooting through the eyes of little Salvatore is somehow lost before we reach the end.Don't get me wrong, there is a place for these types of movies and I think this effort is rather well done although the structure is worn out and Tornatore didn't succeed in tying the two timelines seamlessly together, which also meant that the story progression was predictable.

Kind of astonishing how the directors keep finding the most imbecile and embarrassing ideas to render the story more bloated and its form progressively less watchable.

What started out as a story of a cremator whose beliefs lied in Abstinence, Tibetan philosophy and liberation of the human soul gradually escalated into a cryptic, layered saga of blood thirsty mania. Shrouded in clouds of morbidity where every frame screams death always had this sleeping monster waiting to be awakened, and edited as though we're being led to something unsettling and inevitable. This delirious derangement of a cremator's mind amidst a backdrop of rising Nazism and the political radicalization of Czechoslovakia makes it horrific but thanks to some 'Greek Chrous' like characters coming up with momentary comic reliefs lightening our moods only later succumbing to an unfazed, eerie background score.Feels like ingesting a pill regardless of it's effects having no clue you lost your mind until you are no longer the person you once were.

5733,"This is the movie equivalent of someone grabbing you by the collar, violently shaking you and shouting ""HEY! WAKE THE FUCK UP!!""Mathieu Kassovitz's monochrome masterpiece La Haine is seething with hate and laden with violence. A visceral exploration of class, poverty, youth, racial profiling, police brutality and political instability, Kassovitz's dives deep into 90's France, a time that was scarred with economic recession and societal collapse and uncovers the violent and often shunned facets of society. Harrowing and uncompromising, Kassovitz gets down to brass tacks, as he takes you on journey into a world that's seemingly apocalyptic and eerily prophetic. The friendship between a rag-tag trio of friends and the death of a Arab boy is the crux of the plot. Sayid, Vinz and Hubert are a bunch of hooligans from the fringes of society. Life in the slums are tense after an Arab boy named Abdel is in the hospital due to the riots. Jobless and with alot of time in their hands, the movie shows the thick-as-theives buddies loitering around their projects, picking fights, hurling abuses, passing lewd comments and counter attacking arguments with mom-jokes. Things start becoming interesting when Vinz shows Hubert and Sayid a live pistol that was dropped in a police riot. With a gun in his pants and a thirst to avenge the abused Arab boy in everyone's mind, it sets a series of unpredictable events that will lead to an climax which will take your breath away. What I enjoyed the most in this film are the themes it explored. The gun has so much thematic importance to the film. One can always associate the handgun to an instrument of death or authority. But in La Haine it is a source of power and an extension of one's masculinity. There's so much palpable tension as to when Vinz or Hubert or Sayid squeezes the trigger but it never happens. The gun dictates the actions of both the characters as well as the society they live in. For society, the gun is the ultimate tool for paying back the brutality they face from the police but for Vinz and the other boys, it's like adding a couple of extra inches to their dick. It represents many ideas depending upon whose hands it lays on yet it's final outcome will always be someone's blood on the pavement. And as the Chekov's gun states, there's certainly a bullet coming out of that barrel. Kassovitz's narrative is a seamless stream of consciousness, steeped in black comedy that relies on the characters chemistry, themes as well as events that elevate the themes. Vincent Cassel as the hot-headed Vinz, Saïd Taghmaoui as the jumpy and wide-eyed Sayid and Hubert Koundé as the silent and wise Hubert are playing the role of a lifetime. Coming from distinct ethnic backgrounds, the film masterfully shows how each character experiences racism in a subtle but effective way. It's heard in how Vinz is constantly abused by obscene Jew jokes, said in how Sayid  states that Arabs are crammed in jail more often than others and seen when they face a gang of skinheads. The film had a healthy amount of comedy mainly stemming out of the shenanigans these dummies do like invading an art installation for food or hot-wiring a car without knowing how to drive a car! It's hilarious and portrays the immaturity of these boys. The cinematography by Pierre Aïm is dirty and grimy, fitting the tone of the film. The presentation of the film with it's tight close-ups and ambitious dollies added an sense of urgency and immersion, grabbing your attention and completely engaging you into this oddly familiar world. The editing is very well-done and the black-and-white gave this a timeless feeling, never feeling like it's a product of a specific time period. The values and ideas it talks transcends generations and, as a result, never feels dated despite being 25 years old. Keep in mind, this is Mathieu Kassovitz's debut film. An impressive one, at that. At a tender age of only 26, he explores such wide-ranging and mature themes of social ills and troubled youth, crafting a water-tight script, directing with razor-sharp precision and in the end creating one hell of a film. I apologize if I'm gushing over this film a tad bit more that usual but I sincerely respect this film. It's explosive and just too real. Relating with my own personal experiences with this film, La Haine deeply resonated with me. It's crazy that's this is someone's debut film.

31624,"Rarely do I come across films which are directed so unstylishly to the point where the film nearly loses me due to pure boredom. When Mankiewicz simply refuses to do anything mildly entertaining with the camera or put any effort into the sets of his film, I feel like it’s impossible not to be left cold by a directorial effort as apathetic as this one. There is not a single establishing shot in this movie or any other shot filmed for the purpose of setting a mood/atmosphere, and this lack of a tone set by Mankiewicz becomes more and more apparent as the film trudges along, supported only by its writing. It’s a movie completely void of impressionism, you won’t feel anything that isn’t hand fed to you by the script, and there is absolutely nothing to latch onto visually. The lifeless visuals create a severe lack of nuance here, and form a hole that even a screenplay as compelling as this one can’t overcome, although I’d argue that it too comes across lacking nuance and feels like an amalgamation of old hollywood conventions instead of doing anything inventive.",4,all-about-eve
49099,"Film #4 of the December ChallengeAn interesting concept with good performances, that failed to truly impress in most areas. The cinematography is stunning, and the performances are very good, but nothing else really sticks out. The whole concept of the film is ripe with potential, but the story is so meandering and the characters are at a mix between dull and insane, that it all makes for a mixed picture. There's no connection to the characters in play at this dangerous game, in competition for one master, but the film does produce some moments of chilling beauty and others of obsolete boredom. Unfortunate.However, the quality of the film cannot be denied, as it is fairly good overall. It has plenty of positive aspects, and clearly bears a message against authoritarian governments; and the economy of the castle mistress situation is well fleshed out. I just wished the story would have been more eventful, and the characters been more interesting. The third mistress was really the only one with any unique qualities.Although I did like the ending.

72097,"Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger knew exactly how to bring spectacle peaking the highest cinematic magic while remaining deep in the dramas of reality. A Matter of Life and Death on the surface is a charming and approachable comedy on how love is greater than ourselves or the universe by maximizing romance, grand production, and lush technicolor. For as light as the film feels it is matched with a darkness of a comedy that boldly asks the meaning of life. The Archers production initially commissioned as a propagandist morale boost for The Special Relationship works on many layers as upbeat entertainment satirizing American and British values of colonialism, patriotism, and war while confronting veteran mental health. In the final days of World War II, British bomber pilot Peter Carter’s plane is gunned down. As the rest of his crew goes in flame, Peter’s expected final moments on Earth are left with only a radio transmission of a sweet ground controller’s voice he briefly met named June. The conversation becomes much more philosophical than resourceful as Peter knows his time is up leading to an uncommon bond between the two. Unfortunately, June fell in love with one of the 91,716 to be invoiced in the orderly afterlife but miraculously only 91,715 were delivered. This miracle or mistake kicks off a trial in the sky and a great debate over the individualistic law of love.A Matter of Life and Death is larger than life in scale of production and design. Monumental set pieces and creative visual effects help enhance the story of 40’s magic. The directors’ idea to reverse the conventional concept of heaven with the help of influential cinematographer Jack Cardiff‘s use of monochromatic and color help dissolve the audience into a fantasy of innovation. The film is witty as it is conceptually imaginative in the most British way possible. David Navan and Kim Hunter breathe charm and glamour bringing to life an otherworldly romance that says any love is the only reason for life and death to matter.",9,a-matter-of-life-and-death

55893,"After a well done first act, where our ""hero,"" Nick (Reynolds), tracks down a couple of mafia thugs who beat up and sexually violate his prostitute friend (Karen Young), Heat takes a serious nosedive with a second act dominated by about 20-30 minutes of blackjack scenes. At least we get Diana Scarwid (Psycho III) as the house dealer.That's indicative of Heat on the whole, as it never really maintains a consistent tone or goes far enough in one direction to be really effective. It weirdly vacillates between being an affecting drama -- one of the best scenes is between Reynolds and Young, where she recounts the trauma that happened to her -- a gritty crime thriller and then a goofy action film, replete with laughworthy fight scenes and even ridiculous slow motion shots. (To that end, it kind of reminded me of Larry Cohen's Billy Dee Williams vehicle, Deadly Illusion.)Two elements elevate this out of the gutter: film legend William Goldman brings the kind of lively, colorful dialogue you'd expect from him, even if there isn't quite enough of it; and the cast features some heavyweights, most notably brilliant character actor Peter ""Janosz"" MacNicol as Cyrus, a timid, awkward millionaire, who shares a lot of screentime with Reynolds, making for some interesting interplay with their contrasting styles. Howard Hesseman also has a fun bit part here as the ridiculously named lawyer Pinchus Zion. (The guy sitting in front of me recognized Hesseman from TV's Head of the Class, which made me happy.)Heat is also worth seeing if you want to see Reynolds get his ass kicked by a balding, button-down nebbish named Osgood.",4,heat

44274,"""In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?""Offret was Tarkovsky's final gift to the world. Edited from his deathbead at age 54 where he was dying of cancer, filmed even further from his motherland Russia in Sweden with many of Ingmar Bergman's staple cast and crew, and with no less weighty or fascinating material than he had provided in his previous six masterworks. A film that feels like a tribute to an Auteur he admired and respected, but also a film that whilst it may not be his very best work, it soars higher than most would dare to fly.Opening the film with the single longest take of his career and a heavy focus on dialogue, the setting and tone is immediately a slight variation from Tarkovsky's usual style, the sparse Swedish island setting and Sven Nykvist's unique way of capturing it through a lens feels Bergmanesque, yet as the film drifts into dreamscapes and interiors, Tarkovsky's aesthetic can't help but find it's way in. The plot centres around Erland Josephson as Alexander and the gathering of some friends and family for a birthday meal, his mute son known only as 'Little Man' seems to be his entire world and applies life long wisdom via monologue's to him. A broadcasted threat of WWIII via nuclear warfare sends the party into a frenzied panic which causes Alexander to call upon a higher power which he does not believe in.Whilst his films are spiritual manna and candy for the eyes, it's the themes and symbolism which are the key to unbound intellectual stimulation if you choose to take the challenge. And since my viewing 24 hours ago, I have been unable to stop myself processing, analysing and interpreting the feast of material on offer in The Sacrifice. One can question just how much is dream, reality or a journey through the mind of madness, yet to strip away whatever the intention was and try to attach an interpretation that resonates with you personally is the most rewarding way to view the film. My own dissection of the events on first viewing are only the cusp of what will come to light on a future sitting, yet I cannot help but ponder on what the titular 'sacrifice' is. It all seems to start with an atheist man reaching out in prayer to a God he doesn't believe in, a prayer which sees Alexander offer all he has to save the world from a nuclear apocalypse ""I'll give Thee all I have, I'll give up my family, whom I love, I'll destroy my home and give up Little Man"". If we examine Alexander's strange post-man friend named Otto, who is a student of paranormal phenomena, in league with a witch (who is also one of Alexander's maids) and shows a disdain and disregard for the Leonardo da Vinci painting of the 'Adoration of the magi', we can see that he was the one who seduced Alexander to visit Maria the witch and sleep with her. It would seem that Alexander was easily seduced by a Satanic force that would fulfil his request, if he in turn 'sacrificed' his purity (in yet another trademark ethereal levitation scene). As our protagonist follow's through with his offering of all his worldly possessions by way of burning it all (In a stunningly photographed and haunting scene), he becomes a man possessed.The tree that is planted at the beginning and is returned to in the final shot of the film could be symbol for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, Eden lost due to the temptation from the snake (Maria the witch), or it could be the tree of life, will it grow when watered, is the final shot a tree still dead or coming to life? What does Alexander's sacrifice achieve, can we compare it to Jesus sacrifice and whether that achieved anything? (for many it did, and many it didn't). These are questions about faith that lie at the core essence of the film, yet it thankfully does not give answers, leaving it up to individual belief. This is the true testament to art living on way beyond any authorial intent and taking on a life of it's own and resonating differently with everyone who gazes upon it. I also couldn't help but recall Bergman's Through a Glass Darkly, where we have a similar setting, a gathering, a mentally unstable protagonist, an ambiguous sexual encounter and a similar finale where they are whisked off to mental care as it would seem, but the biggest similarity is of course the crisis of faith, even if Tarkovsky's outlook is ultimately more hopeful.My final chapter in the first leg of my Tarkovsky exploration lies in his final film here, and whilst it has a slightly different flavour to his other works, it is no less potent or poetic. I cherish the experience I have had engaging with his films, and now it's time to begin the cycle again and dive back in, because once you have tasted Tarkovsky, you will always come back...",8,the-sacrifice
39814,"Fosse undeniably influenced and changed choreography, musical cinematography and directing. There's no denying the impact he had to the wider pop culture of musicals both stage and screen, but I have a few too many issues with this film that I feel like I can only really praise the technical aspects.The film feels like so much happens, yet nothing at all, and whilst I don't mind this sometimes, this just couldn't keep me interested when there were no musical numbers being performed. I feel like the peaks and troughs with this film (going from a musical number to longer, drawn out scenes of dialogue) just made it so easy to switch off, as the pacing seemed to slow down in these areas.I do think Roy Scheider was fantastic in this and was actually really surprising. And like mentioned, the technical aspects of the directing and the choreo should be deservingly praised.",4,all-that-jazz

41716,"Probably the funniest movie you'll ever watch about the Jewish experience in Nazi Germany.Chaplin may be remembered to most people nowadays as having basically a singular character, and it's true, many of his notable films featured him as this sort of constantly down-on-his-luck everyman named simply ""The Tramp."" Having written The Tramp character an ending in his previous film, Modern Times, Chaplin sort of reincarnates him here as a Jewish barber who patriotically signs up to defend his country, Tomania. It's an obvious satire of Germany and the first World War, the parallels becoming more obvious as Tomania loses and Chaplin portrays a period of tumult and resentment leading to the rise of the titular ""Great"" Dictator.Aside from playing the Jewish Barber, Chaplin also plays the dictator, humorously named ""Hynkel"". The film definitely focuses more on the barber, but Chaplin has too much fun sending up Hitler with a spot-on imitation of his fiery speeches and famous mood swings. He's fair though, portraying him as a very efficient, ambitious, and clever man who is nevertheless plagued by narcissism and and a disregard for human life in general. But not the Jews in particular. Chaplin savvily shows Hynkel using the Jewish population of ""Tomania"" as scapegoats to unify the general public in his own agenda. Given that this was written in '38 and '39, Chaplin's insight and bravery in this satirization seems uncanny.What he did not know is the true depth of what the Jews were facing in real life. It's shown clearly here that the Barber and his neighbors in the Jewish ghetto risk death if disobedient, but the main fear seems to be losing their businesses and going to a camp where they'd be imprisoned. It's still a fitting portrayal of the early days leading up to WWII in Germany, when Jews faced all sorts of discriminatory practices and harassment through the '30s. Sprinkled in with the comedy bits are moments of real pathos, culminating with the famous ending speech of the film.About the ending speech...at this point it's almost impossible not to feel it's hyped up a bit too much. It's a beautiful piece of writing, soulfully and earnestly delivered. But it errs a little on the side of being so general that it's almost a platitude, something nearly everyone would agree with in principle even though they would disagree about who's actually living up to it or not. It veers slightly into the realm of propaganda and melodrama, which much of this film had avoided. Don't get me wrong, it's a great speech, but I wish people remembered this movie for all the other parts that are also great.There are several fantastic comedy bits here that deserve at least as much recognition as the ending. While this was Chaplin's first true ""talkie"", he has a silent bit for each of his characters on par with his ending speech as ""both"" of them. Each bit is perfectly timed with the score (famous pieces re-recorded by Meredith Wilson), and both are delightful subversions of your expectations. For the Barber, Chaplin has him aggressively shave a customer to Brahms' Hungarian Dance No. 5, a sequence that had me grinning and cringing at the same time. For the Dictator, Chaplin has him pick up a globe and dance with it to Wagner's Lohengrin Prelude. The globe turns out to be light as a balloon, and as the dictator playfully bounced the world around like a toy, I couldn't help but guffaw when he coquettishly popped it high into the air with thrusts from his butt. The two sequences show that even though Chaplin could do speaking roles as good as anyone, he saw the timeless genius in comedy which required no words.While the film is a Chaplin tour-de-force (with him writing, directing, and both starring and co-starring), he's ably aided by many excellent supporting players as well. As good as Chaplin's imitation of Hitler is, Jack Oakie's impression of Mussolini is just as good. I've seen some reviewers let their modern sensibilities bristle at thinking over-the-top mannerisms were reinforcing Italian, Jewish, or German stereotypes here. I'm afraid they don't understand what kind of film they're watching. OF COURSE the mannerisms are broad and over-the-top. It's a satire with lots of physical comedy! Moreover, Oakie's impression of Mussolini is incredibly specific, down to facial expressions and vocal inflections. If you think it's an Italian stereotype, you just need to study up on Mussolini more.I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention Paulette Goddard, previously famous for her show-stealing role as The Gamin in Modern Times. She found probably her greatest success with Chaplin, but her somewhat scandalous relationship with him also may have prevented her from other roles, such as nearly missing out on Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With the Wind. I can't say that her role here is on par with that, but she gives a great comic touch and remains an early feminist force before times nearly drained true feminism from movies for decades after.All in all, this is a film which I think will be evergreen for many years to come. There is room for some criticism, in that it's a bit overlong and perhaps some of the dialogue bits tread similar ground. The title card also instructs you to disregard the Barber and the Dictator's resemblance as ""coincidental"", and indeed nobody reacts strangely to the barber all film... until the very end when (SPOILER?) he's suddenly treated as the spitting image of the Dictator. And the Dictator is forgotten on a fishing boat with no one around? It's all a bit silly in perhaps the wrong way, whereas so much of the film is silly in exactly the right way. The scenes filmed upside-down in the airplane. The scenes of ""Hynkel"" and ""Napoloni"" insecurely competing. Hynkel's minister being called Garbitsch (pronounced ""garbage"").... all great stuff.If you re-edited this today to have a faster flow that matches modern sensibilities, I think you could play it to any modern audience, kids to adults. As is, it still absolutely holds up.",6,the-great-dictator

For those who are worried, this is far from the Oscar-bait picture you may have been expecting. Adapting his own 2012 play, Zeller is far more subtle and creative than many other filmmakers have been when telling stories about dementia. We aren't leaning into melodrama at all. Zeller keeps us largely in Anthony's perspective, meaning we experience his lapses in memory and time as reality. At times it feels like a silly dream, and in other moments, we're genuinely scared for him. The Father is unique in how effectively it demonstrates what this condition is to experience, and not just to witness.It's not the most cinematic project in terms of its overall direction, still clearly being adapted from the stage, but the way we seamlessly move through memories give this adaptation its own strengths. The largest benefit of retelling this story for the screen, though, is the privilege we now have of seeing these actors perform it. Colman is as fantastic as ever, and Hopkins does some truly staggering work. He gets some big moments to really go for, but for the most part, this is a quiet, delicate performance he excels at brilliantly.",7,the-father-2020

70765,"After the most recent United Nations General Assembly meeting on climate change, 16 year old environmental activist Greta Thunberg appears to be the talk of the perfectly temperate globe. Thunberg? Hmm, that sounds familiar. Where have I heard that name before? Oh that’s right, Olof Thunberg plays the organist in Ingmar Bergman’s Christian existentialist film Winter Light, and Olof just so happens to be Greta’s grandfather! Upon this revelation, I thought I’d look for his other acting credits on IMDb, and much to my surprise he was a regular voice actor for the Swedish overdubbing of such Disney classics as The Jungle Book and One Hundred and One Dalmations. Illuminati confirmed! Read on to learn how I’ve deduced that Greta Thunberg is a globalist media plant and a crisis actor for the CLIMATE HOAX AGENDA.In the film, young grandpa Thunberg plays a church organist. He doesn't have much to say in Winter Light aside from a brief monologue chiding lead actress Ingrid Thulin about her being a spinster, but after that he goes to tell Gunnar Bjornstrand that he wouldn't mind missing church services as he has a gig ""at the Masonic Temple"" later that night. Forget the Bilderbergs; here is our first clue that the Thunberg bloodline planted the seeds of our modern climate hoax all the way back in 1963 with their Freemason connections. Also note that the film is called Winter Light like ""Bud Light"" or ""Crystal Light"", suggesting that one should think of the not-so-very frosty seasons to come with only half the calories (a value of energy needed to raise the temperature of water). We all know that the myth of climate change has seen many names like ""el Niño"", ""global warming"", and ""runaway greenhouse effect"". Winter Light found itself another name with Paul Schrader's 2018 film First Reformed, a movie that shares unmistakably similar characters, plot, visual elements, and themes. In both films, a small town pastor is asked by one of his pregnant parishioners to speak with her husband due to her concern about the man's recent depression and suicidal ideation. In Winter Light, his despair is driven by the fear of nuclear annihilation by China, but in First Reformed, the man is an obsessive environmentalist, distraught over the so-called impending climate crisis. In Schrader's retelling, the pastor gets worked up enough in the climate debate to consider a terrorist attack on a local church in order to prove his allegiance to this cult of ideology the climate shysters refer to as a ""97% consensus in the scientific community"". Utilizing their connections with Ingmar Bergman, one of the most celebrated and influential film directors of the 20th century, Disney, one of the largest entertainment conglomerates in the world, as well as the Freemasons and their globalist cronies in the United Nations, the Thunberg dynasty have primed the sheep-like masses to accept the CLIMATE HOAX through programming and poised their Reptilian Shapeshifting May-Queen Greta Thunberg on the world stage to amplify the paranoia about a non-existant impending climate catastrophe. How else can you explain how this little girl has gone from holding protest signs outside of her quaint Swedish secondary school to being a world-renown spokesperson for the environmentalist movement in less than two years?It's time for this country to wake up. I'm not afraid, and I'm not ashamed to speak the TRUTH about CLIMATE PSEUDOSCIENCE. I will bravely stand with tobacco lobbyists, multinational oil corporations, the coal industry, Jair Bolsonaro, and MY PRESIDENT Donald Trump against the international cabal of ""Chicken Littles"". I will bravely defend these impartial proponents of integrity and altruism when they roll back any and all basic environmental protections on air, water, soil, and wildlife conservation while making no effort to bolster renewable energy sources. When we finally reach the utopia that is bound to result from such policies, I will walk gayly out onto my front lawn on a slightly chilly day in the middle of January and smugly say: ""So much for global warming!""",1,winter-light

72750,"''Once I had it all. Now I just have everything.''What an odd duck this disappointing effort from Nicolas Roeg is, despite the obvious ambition of the piece. I was sort of with it from it's hallucinatory and enigmatic opening sequence (except WTF was the man on the steps blowing his head off all about?), where Gene Hackman's Jack McCann sells his soul to a demon for gold (well that's all I can interpret from it), and then the thrills and intrigue slow right down to a plod as we enter a future where he is a wealthy Caribbean island owner, wrestling with his own materialistic malaise as well as the effect it is having on his relationship with his wife and daughter (Theresa Russell). Much of the drama centres around his disdain toward his son in law (Rutger Hauer), a social climber who he assumes is a threat, and Jack's spiralling descent into madness - Oh, and I mustn't forget the largely uninteresting subplot that involves Joe Pesci and Mickey Rourke as Miami Mobsters who seeking to win a piece of his island to build a casino. There is a strange blend of tones and heightened melodrama that at times feels like a 'Merchant Ivory' period piece before being torn asunder by jarring and brutally violent episodes. There is an all-star cast here doing fine work as a positive note and it appeals visually with Roeg's sensibilities largely at play, but I can't profess to being invested in the narrative completely, despite being intrigued from the outset and the Voodoo strand of the film sat rather awkwardly - In fact Angel Heart made use of it's dark mysterious leanings way more successfully 4 years later. It is interesting to note (from Wikipedia): '' Film critic and film maker, Mark Cousins put Eureka in his top ten favourite films in the Sight and Sound Greatest Films poll 2012 and has called the film a 'masterpiece'. Danny Boyle classified this film as underrated.'', but all I can say is - Please explain to me why this is so, because I am a fan of Roeg too, but this was just messy.",5,eureka
55463,"Film Club Ranked 👍🏼I was not expecting such a violent and gory anime coming into this film. I had to put the ""viewing experience"" aside and concentrate on the plot, theme, and characters. I found that the character development for everyone except the protagonist was weak and shallow. I could never understand any motivation for the erratic behavior of the friend. Now, this is more like an American movie than some cutting-edge Asian import. The animation is stunning and impactful. However, this is another case of style over substance to me. The plot was very poorly explained, especially the last 20 minutes. There is literally no explanation for what happens at the end of this movie. Perhaps that may be the whole point of the film is to leave the explanation up to the viewer's perspective. However, it just didn't click for me. The theme of the film made sense to me. Our world faces grave danger from our misunderstanding of technology and humanity's preoccupation with it. We will be our downfall if we are not careful. Good message, I get it. Overall, I thought it was a bit sloppy in direction, and the story was lacking in interest. However, it does make the viewer ponder about all the questions left unanswered. Solid film, and I'm glad I was introduced to it. I think I appreciate this film more than I like it. I would recommend everyone to watch this at least once.",5,akira
47056,"My first ever Akira Kurosawa movie! It was so great to finally be able to watch one of his movies. And yeah, this was definitely really really great. I guess it wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be but I still really loved it. Even though not much of Sanjuro's backstory is explained, I feel that's part of what makes him such an interesting character. It poses a lot of questions as to who he truly is, but aside from that, he's already an extremely interesting and cool character just from his sheer presence. He's so cool and sexy and bad ass. I know that someone walking away from an explosion is a somewhat common and well-known trope, but when Sanjuro walks away from doing something bad-ass, it's the coolest shit in the world. The guy could tell me to jump off a cliff and I would do it, no hesitation. The story was mostly extremely engaging! I just kind of think that there are a few parts in the middle and last act where not a lot happens story wise and it's not all that interesting, and some scenes seem to last a bit too long. But that's really my only flaw in an otherwise fantastic movie. It tells such a captivating story about a town that's in a very bad state. We get to see how the town, and the people, change, and Akira Kurosawa does this masterfully. Speaking of Kurosawa, the direction is just great, but I'm assuming I don't need to say that. Definitely deserves a rewatch to see if the score could go up but I'm pretty confident that it will in the future. Definitely give this one a watch.

33905,"Theo Angelopolous (along with Bela Tarr) is one of the directors whose filmography I have been dreading to get into, for quite a few years.

And hence I conclude, films like these dont deserve my mediocre analysis, my views can never in a million years encapsulate an artist's true vision. This is to be ""felt"", as he intends. Robert Bresson once said in an interview,I would rather people feel a film before understanding it. I would rather feeling arise before intellectI concur, for I view films with that same intention, and the experience I have is always transcendental (especially with films like these). And so I was right to dread, I was right to avoid Theo Angelopolous, because Landscape in the Mist beats everything I have seen in my life so far, to the point that I feel, nothing around me makes sense anymore.

9214,"☆""Why must fireflies die so soon?""☆Film Recommendation #22 – from WowMIKEWow.Christ, that Owl City song really is terrible, isn't it? I hate that this movie made me remember it.This was significantly better than I thought it would be, precisely because it wasn't at all like much of the anime I dislike or avoid. Hotaru no Haka [""Grave of the Fireflies""] isn't a goofy fantasy or whimsical kids story, it's straightforward and tragic and mature, gripping in its drama and universal themes of personal sacrifice and isolation in times of terror and confusion. I will always unfairly hold anime to a different standard however, but this managed to break through my barrier of criticism for the most part.In the final months of World War II, American firebombing raids pounded Japanese cities into submission and destruction, killing and displacing many more than the atomic bombs in August. In the city of Kobe, two orphans named Seita (voiced by Tsutomu Tatsumi) and Setsuko Yokokawa (Ayano Shiraishi) realize their mother has died from such a bombing, though the older Seita tries to hide the truth from his young sister Setsuko. After staying with a distant relative (Akemi Yamaguchi) for a time, they leave when she becomes resentful and only take with them a tin of Sakuma drops.Their home is now an abandoned bomb shelter, where fireflies alight the night sky. The siblings have little but they make do, though any money is useless with nothing to buy anyway. Running out of food and realizing his sister is ill and at risk of starvation, Seita must steal to survive. Even as the war comes to an end, can they make it before succumbing to reality?Before I forget, wow did I love the score for this movie. Michio Mamiya only scored a handful of films. Why?What I appreciated most about this story, written and directed by Isao Takahata, is that it doesn't try to be anything it's not. Focused on the little girl and her teen brother, Grave of the Fireflies finds light moments amidst the tragic reality of survival during wartime for children and those left behind while a country rages against the dying of the light while another bombs them into oblivion. Nearly the entire movie is centered on these youngsters and their plight, particularly how an older brother is trying to shield his young sister from the horrors of war. It's one of the film's most painful scenes when Seito realizes Setsuko actually did find out about her mother's death, despite his attempts to hide it. It's in these moments we most empathize with him, trying to do what's right but knowing it's impossible when cruelty and truth exist so openly.Now, the distant aunt is just cartoonishly mean and dismissive of these children that this portion of the movie is hard to take seriously. I understand that the point is to show how war divides us and fractures families, but this woman is over the top with how callous and cruel she is to these children for really no reason at all. I wasn't supposed to be rolling my eyes during this serious and sad movie but that long portion of her insults and anger was quite dumb. Other adults are nearly as dismissive as she is, but not as condescending and quick to insult, and it's cringey AF as the youths of today say.However, thankfully Takahata refocuses after this, back to the tragic neorealism that won me over, unafraid to show the barren hellscape of war and its aftermath as a brother fails to keep his sister safe while his family and country abandoned them. (I don't know about the choice to show us in the film's opening minutes what their fates were. Or am I the only person to think that was a strange way to spoil the drama?) Regardless, leaning into the pain of loss and futile struggle to protect one's loved ones is a daring theme for an animated feature, and that makes this a challenging and emotionally resonant work worth its acclaim. This medium – I guess you're not supposed to call it a genre – will always be unfairly judged by yours truly, but this is about as good as they get for me.That abrupt ending caught me by surprise.

Excluyen al espectador, porq su manera de suponer q ya saben ese conocimiento se consigue investigando, cuando la película misma tiene q exponerte su punto y su visión y es algo q de nuevo se está volviendo a repetir en los cineastas, olvidan su talento de adentrar su ficción al espectador.La película se desarrolla como una colección de escenas eliminadas de una docena de diferentes películas de arte italianas llenas de ficción. El estilo de carnicería funciona aún menos debido a una falta casi total de humor combinada con temas secos como relaciones y reflexiones de metanivel sobre el cine (reto a cualquiera que no sea cineasta o erudito a encontrar esto aunque sea remotamente interesante).Pero, con diferencia, el problema principal es que todos los personajes están ahí para volverte loco, y eso que ví tantas películas ya sean q otros les parecieron aburridas o q no tenían trama, pero q jamás le veían la cara al espectador, con esta película no puedo decir lo mismo, si de por si ando algo estresado en los estudios, esta película me puso peor, y me hizo pensar q este en definitiva, este cine excluyente es lo q no quiero terminar haciendo en un futuro._________________________________________________REVIEW IN ENGLISH I think I'm beginning to understand why Tarantino had a kind of hatred for these films... They exclude the viewer, because their way of assuming that they already know that knowledge is obtained by research, when the film itself has to explain its point and its vision and It is something that is being repeated again by filmmakers, they forget their talent of bringing their fiction to the viewer.The film unfolds as a collection of deleted scenes from a dozen different fiction-filled Italian art films.  The carnage style works even less due to an almost complete lack of humor combined with dry themes like relationships and meta-level musings on film (I challenge anyone who isn't a filmmaker or scholar to find this even remotely interesting). But, by far, the main problem is that all the characters are there to drive you crazy, and I saw so many movies whether others found them boring or that they had no plot, but they never saw the viewer's face, with this movie I can't say the same, if I'm already somewhat stressed in the studies, this film made me worse, and made me think that this, in short, this exclusive cinema is what I don't want to end up doing in the future.",2,8-half

It breaks down the ways food is interwoven into our lives, not just to sustain us, but as a foundational part of society and the human experience. It’s thought-provoking stuff!And the central conceit of the Western-type drifter rolling in on his iron horse to help a woman build a proper ramen restaurant is specifically illuminating. I’ve always been curious about ramen, and this explains everything you’d ever need to know: how to eat it, how to prepare it, what’s involved in the noodles, and the broth, and all the way to the serving. This too is valuable!Moreover, its portrayal of food is borderline (and in some cases, explicitly) pornographic. It lavishes great loving attention on serving up some of the most drool-inducing food, shot in close-up and with unrelenting affection. Rarely has food been quite so central a character. So yes, I was loving this movie, fascinated by its unconventional approach, its weird kinetic energy, and its lavish visuals. Until we get to the middle of the film, that is, when in preparation for one of the food scenes, someone picks up a live and wriggling soft-shelled turtle, cuts into its flesh, lops off its head, and dumps out its guts. I stopped the film cold right then and there. This is a horror, felt keenly and deeply in my bones, a moment which turned my affection for this film into pure ash. It took me a solid day to reset myself and start the second half of the film. I realize that this is perhaps inadvertently the dark side of food and its societal role that the film hadn’t anticipated: how it is overwhelmingly predicated on the slaughter, death, and mangling of animals. This is something we inherently know, and isn’t specific to Japanese culture, of course: this turtle could just as easily be a cow for a hamburger shop, a chicken for a KFC, or a pig for a breakfast joint. The reality is that meat which is so central to common diet is itself reliant on the death and suffering of living beings. Please note that I’m not seeking to guilt anyone for making that choice; I point it out only as a factual truth (which the movie itself invites!) because the movie is about highlighting these relationships and processes around food. If you have an entire film where you take a hard look at the role of food in our lives, and how our meals are prepared, and then include this specific scene of death, then it is equally fair to discuss it. Maybe I might have glossed over this moment, and all my subsequent interpretation, had I not become a non-meat guy a year ago. I consider myself a passive non-meat-consumer; I don’t want to give it a label, because I don’t have hard rules around it, and I don’t judge others for their choices nor do I rally any activism for it. Others can do as they wish, and bless ‘em. I do what I do, for my own reasons — including my deep love and respect for animals.As such, seeing this scene was like going to a kid’s birthday party and then being suddenly knifed by the clown: the tone turned immediately from one of joy to one of deep horror, and subsequently ruined any positivity or enjoyment I’d previously felt around the film. This doesn’t mean I don’t respect or admire what else it’s doing, because as outlined above, I totally do. It’s masterful in so many ways. I also deeply hated how it made me feel. As such, it gets the rating it gets: I’m not scoring movies on a perception of quality but on my experience of watching them, and as such, this lands, unfortunately, at this. I do realize I’m unusually sensitive, though. I get why it’s revered, and not too long ago, I would have joined in that praise. But not today. Your mileage will almost certainly vary.",1,tampopo
49423,"I think it was Dan Harmon who developed and perfected the formula for making dense, expansive, overtly “wacky,” self-consciously high-concept comedies that are not-so-secretly concerned with more serious themes: the trick is that you smuggle something sentimental into something exceedingly ridiculous and/or intellectual, thereby locating the rich, gooey core at the centre of the hard candy of an ordinarily low-stakes, low-brow genre. When done well, as in, say, the Community episode “Abed’s Uncontrollable Christmas,” or (to a lesser extent) the Rick and Morty episode “Pickle Rick,” the juvenile premise effectively disguises the emotional throughline until the precise moment that the focus shifts and it becomes blindingly clear: a claymation Christmas special is actually about a teenager being abandoned by his mother; a cartoon action blockbuster is actually about alcoholism and avoiding therapy. Everything Everywhere is entirely built around this trick (not insignificantly, it’s produced by longtime Community directors the Russos), but it gets the ratio of high-concept lunacy to mawkish gutpunch entirely wrong — it’s like 20% lunacy to 80% mawkish when it should be the opposite. There’s a lot going on, obviously; it nevertheless attempts to make time to try for a tender moment every five minutes, which is simply a miscalculation. It wants to make something moving out of a rock with googly eyes, a black-hole bagel, a talking raccoon, hot dog fingers, etc, any one of which would have been a totally fine gambit, but taken together, it just feels like a lot of arbitrary, goofy stuff, none of which landed for me at all. By the time it reaches its teary-eyed, cathartic grand finale, any chance of surprise that a movie about the multiverse is actually about family or accepting yourself or love or whatever has been squandered a hundred times over. In what dimension is it remotely justifiable to have a 40-minute emotional climax? I get that you want to build to a hug but maybe give us more kung-fu first.",3,everything-everywhere-all-at-once
40845,"Release date: November 26, 1945 After reading several glowing reviews of this film, I screwed up my courage and settled in for a viewing. There are so many personality types in this world, so when two people meet and get along so well, it seems extraordinary.It is those little things that happen in our lives—those little things that seem so special,  they must be kismet. As the story develops, we delve into the lives of Albert Godby (Stanley Holloway) and Myrtle Bagot (Joyce Carey). We get to see their true character and their aspirations for the future, along with a few reminiscences of those days-gone-by. There is also a subplot about a narcissist doctor and an easily distracted housewife (who has a cook and a maid); they drink tea or something.  I laughed out loud when she got scared after seeing a women wearing a ‘terrible hat’.It is left to our imagination, but Albert would ask Myrtle to attend the wedding reception with him.

1109,"While director Akira Kurosawa's timeless masterpiece clocks in at nearly 3 1/2 hours long it zipped by so fast I couldn't believe it! It was so well done I wished it had been longer!  The story is about a great Samurai warrior who now faces a time of peace where Samurai are deemed a useless commodity! Masterless they struggle to find a place in this new world!One such Samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) is sought out by farmers whom wish to hire Samurai to fend off an attack by bandits!  But they can only offer rice as pay!  The Samurai scoffs as he see's no honor, reward, rank or glory to be had from such a fruitless venture! But wisdom prevails when he discovers rice is worth its weight in gold for these impoverished peasants and accepts the offer!  He must now persuade 6 more Samurai to join him in his quest!Your attention always gravitates towards Takashi Shimura as he has such a commanding presence!  On the other hand we have a young, abrasive, brute of a wannabe Samurai Kikuchiyo played by Toshirô Mifune who often steals the show with his antics!  The Samurai allow him to follow them as they were short a Samurai and I suspect they found great pleasure in treating him like a buffoon as it gave them a false sense of superiority!As it turns out he proves to be an asset and at one point in the film he manages to teach the Samurai their greatest lesson in life ""Humility!""The war strategies implemented in the film were extraordinary! The battles themselves were exhilarating!  The strength of the direction, script, acting earned this film the position of favorite Akira Kurosawa film!",9,seven-samurai
15645,"After the death of their mother, Jeanne and Simon Marwan travel somewhere in the Middle East to fulfill her last wish: to find the father they thought was dead and a brother whose existence they didn't know in order to give them a letter. Jeanne begins to reconstruct the past to try to understand her mother and, at the same time, unveil secrets about her mysterious origin. What she finds is the heartbreaking story of a woman caught in a cruel war, her unwavering strength of will and the unconditional love of a mother.Incendies is a devastating work about the hidden wounds we carry inside as well as a denouncement about the meaninglessness of religion and war caused by human fanaticism. Denis Villeneuve slowly constructs the tragic story of a family, a story about violence, the weight of the past and the search for truth and the roots that began to sprout in the midst of hatred and desolation. Incendies is an intense and overwhelming film, a brutal reflection on identity and the vestiges of war that remain in people and permeate the present.",7,incendies
77572,"Guided by Satyajit Ray's moody direction, honed by enthralling camerawork, and supported by Karuna Banerjee's extraordinary performance, Aparajito is a remarkable illustration of compassionate storytelling. Ray's follow up of the exceptional ""Pather Panchali"" is another astonishing exhibit of his genius. Apu is a little child who lives in poverty with his folks. We watch him develop into a fine youngster. There is potential for him, however his hopes, dreams and aspirations end up drawing him further and further away from his mother, we understand his ambitions but at the same time are also moved by his mother's loneliness. Simple as it might appear, there is a lot of intricacy underneath. That is the sheer virtuoso of Satyajit Ray who coordinated this film in a dainty budget. The connection between mother and child are beautifully explored, with their varying viewpoints and values illustrative of the generation gap. The conditions presented here might be explicit, while the story has a universal allure. Life is filled with distress, misery, agony and misfortune. Then, there are occasions of joy and happiness, 'Aparajito' mixes these multitude of emotions making it an unforgettable story.",8,aparajito

Sure, there are some awesome landscape shots and historic reconstructions that ease intended tension and suspense, but the movie primarily focuses on the people we meet throughout this six hour epic and the way that their lives intertwine. Scenes of strained familial relationships and issues relating to mental health take up the vast chunk of the plot, as the central characters grow, develop, become sidetracked and deal with thorny and complex situations as they (apparently) age.The film covers so much ground, though, while fumbling across issues relating to mental decline, suicide and insurgency, that depth is often sacrificed for plot development. Subjects are skimmed over to provide an immensely broad story, which felt frequently void of the compassion I needed to connect.",4,the-best-of-youth

13255,"Self-determination found in Andrei Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev Humans are very special—because they were created with different talents, needs, and characters to each other. Humans being are also peculiar because they have desire, ambition, and lust that somehow destruct themselves and their surroundings, yet they do not know about it or perhaps they know, but pretending to not know. Humans are never feeling enough for themselves, they always to seek many ways to reach what they dream about, and therefore they can live comfortably in society. It refers to self-determination. Self-determination is a human‘s freedom to choose or determine their own fate. Or, it can be expressed as existentialism that emphasizes the individual in a unique person as the self-determining human who responsible for their choices (Corey, 1996:169). The human presence is told to be certified when he can consider himself to choose and to decide acquiescently who and what he will become. Either, human beings formthemselves through out their own act and manner. To associate himself, a human does not want to be ruled by others, even nature, and social culture. It refers to existentialism. Existentialism examines believes in living and struggling for life. Sartre states that existentialism is a philosophical theory that emphasizes the existence of the individual person as a free and responsible agent determining their own development through acts of will. Man makes for himself (Childe, 1937). According to those explanations, this writing will be considered to the self-determination of Andrei, Daniil, and Kirill. Andrei Rublev is depicted as a religious icon painter. He moved to every place during the turbulent era. He struggled to gain the reputation of his art. Daniil is described as modest and Kiriil is not capable as painter, but still keeps trying to be painter. This movie will be divided into some chapters. The Jester (Summer 1400)Andrei, Daniil, and Kirill are searching monks and devotional icon painters, looking for a job. On their journey, the heavy rain is coming. They find shelter in the barn, then they meet with a group of villagers and jester. Those characters represent different personalities. Theophanes the Greek (Summer-Winter-Spring-Summer 1405-1406)Self-determination on Kiriil shows obviously on how he truly wants that job that offered by Theophanes. In the beginning, he refused it—he thought that Theophanes was making fun of him. In fact, Theophanes really need some help. Then, Kiriil takes that offering with one condition.Kiriil: Come to Andronikov Monastery to fetch me. Before the community, the metropolitan ask me to help you. Before the brotherhood, before Andrei Rublev. Then I shall serve you like a slave...Like a dog until the day I die.Kiriil is willing to help Theophanes and make sure Theophanes does not get some hand from anyone else, including Andrei or Daniil. Kiriil wants their fellows to witness him that he is offered the job by Theophanes. He is controlled by his ambition and jealousy. Also, Kiriil is defined as an imperious person—asks someone else to do what he says and if he/she does not want to do it, he will get mad. On the other hand, there is Andrei Rublev who encourages his friend—Daniil to go with him for working with Theophanes.Andrei: let’s go today shall we Daniil? Go quickly before Thoephanes changes his mind!Daniil: I’m not goingAndrei: why aren’t you going? I thought we’d go togetherDaniil: why did you think for me? I was not invited.Andrei has a passion to become an artist (painter). He intends to pursue it, but he wants to share it with the other fellows, including Daniil. There is naivety inside Andrei—he wants to go to get the chance to work for Theophanes, on the other hand he wants Daniil follows him. Kiriil is outraged and jealous of Andrei. He thought that he’s the one who works for Theophanes, in fact, Theophanes is completely changing his mind and chooses Andrei instead of him.Kiriil: I’m tired of lying. I’m going back into the secular world. Why did we leave the Trinity Monastery? Andrei, Daniil you are not saying anything. Because the brothers valued profit higher than faith.From this statement above, Kiriil is envious. He’s really want to be in Andrei’s position. There is social jealousy in here, sadly Andrei and Daniil don’t notice it. Kiriil’s existence wants to be recognized by society.Kiriil: God is praised that he gave me no talent.This statement above is a form of Kiriil’s anger to God and his jealousy over Andrei and Daniil then expressed it in front of villagers because of his disappointment. The last judgment (Summer 1408)Andrei and Daniil are working on the decoration of a church in Vladimir. Even though they have been there for two months the walls are still white. A messenger arrives with word from the Bishop, who is lashed out, to say they have time till autumn to windup the job. In the middle of a field of flowers, Andrei confesses to Daniil that the task revolts him and that he is not capable to paint a subject like the Last Judgement as he doesn't want to scare people into conformity.Andrei: I’m what I am. You couldn’t teach me integrity!From that line, Andrei does not want to be commanded. Because of the reason that he has said before. In existence, the power of consciousness enables man to reject his self-present condition (Sartre, 1943: 63). Andrei feels trapped and wants to get his own freedom to paint whatever he wants. He concludes that he has lost his mind that an artist needs for his work.Andrei: you see I think it will be better if we don’t paint The Last Judgment at all.Conclusion: Based on the movie that I’ve watched, Andrei Rublev wants to have freedom and peace in his life. Through self-determination, Andrei Rublev comes to silence and embodies his passion to become a painter. The self-determination of Andrei struggles lots of things not only about his passion but also to encourage people that humans have two sides (good and bad). People must be making mistake, but we should not punish them harshly. Tarkovsky as movie director of Andre Rublev uses self-determination as guidance to the character to help him decide his own choice. Furthermore, he combines it with religion approach, history approach, and art. Andrei Rublev is complex movie and this review uses characterization approach. *Note: I wrote this review when I was bored with my assignments from college, lol. For the record, I’m not Tarkovsky’s fan. I make this writing because I’m fascinated with Andrei Roublev. My brain does not entirely understand when consumed this movie, but this is my garbage opinion about Andrei Rublev. You can make your own writing with different opinions and points of view, of course.I know this review is awful in so many ways also lacks in lots of aspects, therefore you can suggest references to me. Do me a favor, don’t do hate speech on this review, lol. For those people who read this review, thank you so much really appreciate your time.*This writing has been revised*",8,andrei-rublev

66201,"I could have watched 2 Hisayasu Satô movies instead of this. So of course, I chose wrong. I really wanted to like this film. With the reviews, I expected an immediate masterpiece that could hypnotize me. But there's nothing here. It's limp. Too clean. Sterile. Safe. There's no moods here. No longing. Alienation. Nihilism. Nothing beautiful to look at. Nothing grotesque. Nothing grungy. The edges have been sanded off and talked away.Even if he survives on the worst VHS transfers, Satô is the 90s. He paints in beautiful blues, captures the coldness of the city, and its strangeness. ""Cure"" is never shocking nor even eerie or dream-like. It's a dull procedural far too conventional in plot and cinematography for me.This is somewhat the same struggle I had with ""Trouble Every Day"" (2001) recently, but that film was worse and suffered from terrible acting from the husband (Vincent Gallo) and his wife. No one is a bad actor in ""Cure,"" but I want someone to possess me here. My husband asked me if we're jaded. I disagree: I'm worshipping and throwing five stars at the alter of Jess Franco (and I can't convince him to share that delusion). I can handle slow, aimless plots that are pure cinematic dreams.

21011,"the potential this film could have had to follow jane’s perspective as a texas peep show club girl until one of her anonymous clients begins to tell her his story that eerily sounds like the worst years of her life…...but instead it chose to sympathize with a fifty-something man who impregnated a teenager, abused her, and then fucked off into the desert for 4 years while she rebuilt her life and found a stable home for the child he abandoned. the director and screenwriter both expressed that travis’ time in the desert brought him to the realization that his violence could not be undone… but the fact that he kidnaps hunter, uproots his life, and forces jane to take sole responsibility for him says the exact opposite. travis and jane’s reunion literally takes place when she’s in a box where he can see her but she can’t see him, and he can leave at any time without her knowing; the way he forces her to deduce his identity from his expository dump of her trauma shows that he still needs to have control over her. travis' decision to leave hunter and jane together and take off again is framed as an act of love and sacrifice (to reunite mother and son, this time free from the father who harmed them). but in the end, travis is nothing more than a selfish puppeteer as he attempts to atone for his sins by forcing everyone to accept a do-over of their lives that none of them asked for, then choosing not to stick around for the consequences.i’m stunned that i’ve only heard glowing praise for this film. i truly believe that without nastassja kinski it wouldn’t be rated as highly as it is, and you can’t change my mind",3,paris-texas

30392,"I really struggled with this. Maybe a part of my struggle was an assumption (a dumb one) that this was a pirate movie. In my world, color + ""beard"" = pirate. Plus, the scruffy visage of Toshiro Mifune just screams craggy ship captain.This is not a pirate movie. It doesn't take place on the sea, or in salty pubs, or amid a port town.Instead, it's a story of a young doctor with ambition who gets placed in an intern position with an established small town doctor--a position he didn't ask for, that he didn't want. We see various stages of the clinic and his reaction to the situation, but the meat of the story is various interactions. Woeful monologues, extended flashback scenes, and the occasional stoic glare of Mifune.To me it felt like a whole lot of random encounters--building blocks that supposedly change the young doctor's world view. But he's kept at arm's length for the majority of the movie. I felt like, as a viewer, I was seeing the change in the young doctor because I was being told he was changing, not because I could glean the information from how he is presented.At over three hours, Red Beard feels more like a series of character-linked short stories than a cohesive film. But it's not structured like you'd expect a series of short stories to be, creating a flailing search on my part for a semblance of plot to snap everything into focus.As you'd expect with a well-regarded Akira Kurosawa film, Red Beard scores highly pretty much everywhere. Despite my pittance of a score, this'll be tagged for a rewatch at some point to see if a second viewing (without the burdensome expectations) will allow me to find that something everyone else seems to have found from watching it.",3,red-beard

But I... didn't like this.  I disliked most of the characters.  And the strongest character of the lot is treated very cruelly.  I'm speaking, naturally, of Nadia, played by Annie Girardot (who is solid, and to whom Alyssa Milano bears a resemblance).  The character works in the world's oldest profession and comes between two of the brothers, and although she's given plenty of dimension as a character, she's also used primarily as a tool in telling the story of the brothers (and here come the spoilers).  The abusive one, Simone (Renato Salvatori), steals for her, is spurned by her, rapes her, stalks her, and ultimately kills her.  And this is so we can see how the brother Rocco (Alain Delon) responds.  Frankly, for as disgusting as Simone is, Rocco doesn't fare much better in his supposedly saintly behavior.  In the desperation to preserve the ideal of his family, he suggests to Nadia that she return to Simone for the sake of Simone because she is all he has.  This is after he's raped her.  Just thinking about this scenario sickens me.  It makes me wonder what we are meant to think of these people, this family.  What do they represent?  What does their experience of relocating from the boonies to Milan represent?  How does the experience of having a romantic rivalry melodramatically tear a family apart represent the lives of the urban Italian citizens of this time?  I'm not sure I cared.  I felt contempt for these people, for those brothers and their shrew of a mother.  Simone confesses what has happened and she slaps Ciro (Max Cartier), the only son who made any sense?Maybe Luchino Visconti meant for us to feel this way?  I don't know, usually movies are trying to get us to empathize with the major characters, but that wasn't happening for me.  In terms of objective value, though, I could see that the scope of the movie and the portrayal of family dynamics and family troubles was influential to similar movies to come, most notably The Godfather.  It's interesting to me that this film was about just this outwardly regular family, though, while The Godfather had the Mafia world as its backdrop.  I kept wondering where this one was going.  All I know is that my heart was with Nadia, but once she was disposed of we were left to see what happened in the aftermath with this family.  Was I meant to care about their fates?  Did no one care about hers?In the end, Ciro talks about Rocco and no one says a word for Nadia.  I feel like that said it all for me.  I believe I was meant to feel something akin to sadness for the fate of this family, but after three hours with them I was only feeling glad to part company.",3,rocco-and-his-brothers
76292,"A niche stop motion animation that takes a really personal subject for a lot of people sounds as a promising project; yet I found this film insoportable from start to finish. This film tries too hard to be funny but is just way too quirky and in several stances asinine that its intentions of ""comedy"" are a pain in the ass; maybe this could be considered a subjective aspect, I mean while I believe that comedy has a lineament to determine whether it is acceptable or it isn't (like there are topics that are unacceptable to treat with mockery) , when a joke can be morally and socially considered as acceptable I think it is mostly (if not entirely) subjective.Then you have Mary and Max, a film that I wouldn't know how to put it exactly in terms of its tone and intended comedy. I wouldn't say it is completely incorrect but it is unsettling and can be easily misguided making a pun out of the characters instead out of their actions as I guess is originally intended. I don't think it blatantly wants to mock suicide, mental illness, etc. but is exceedingly stupid the choices Adam Elliot picked for these topics and especially for some specific scenes. Take Mary's suicide sequence as an example, Mary having a fucking hill of pills to swallow gave me the same vibes as Tony Montana digging his face in a big mountain of coke at the end of Scarface, is so over the top and silly that it makes you question whether the director wants you to take the scene seriously or just crack up a laugh so as payoff it belittles the seriousness of the topic. And then there's the main topic the film tries to address: mental disorders. I don't have Asperger (the main topic this film addresses) so I'm not relating this over any personal experience over the subject but I found the portrayal of Max nauseating, his persona never exists outside Asperger, is as if he made Autism his whole personality and is never appreciated outside of that, the film choses that everyone (including himself) sees him as the ""Aspie"" guy so everything he does, feels and says is because of his mental condition. While yeah, a mental disorder can heavily condition a person it doesn't determines who that person is. If understanding someone with a mental condition is intended to make them comfortable and gain normality then is contradictory to pigeonhole them on a pre-stablished bias and reduce their person solely to their mental condition?As an example to understand this better, think on how several people react when someone announces he/she is homosexual. I've seen a surprising amount of people that when a celebrity states he is gay they automatically asume that everything he will say and how he will act is linked to his homosexuality, as if sexual preference was their whole personality; immediately they stop to see that person for his personality and just for being gay. Don't you think that simplifying a person to something they went through, a mental disorder, their sexual preference, etc. is making them feel pigeonholed on a square and forced to fill what society expects from them instead of truly accepting and supporting others by letting them be.This is how stereotypes are created, we perceive others not as persons but as ideals, nationalities, conditions, etc. And this is why Max doesn't work on my eyes, he is the embodiment of a stereotype of Asperger, I learned nothing of such an important topic for several people than what a Wikipedia article could already tell me, he is reduced to his mental condition and checks the boxes of the pre-conceived stereotype of Asperger. The thing is that we as individuals are so different that reducing something so complex to an academic reading or even worse to a stereotype feels dishonest to the real person's experience as we all might process and endure things differently.I've read some reviews of the site of people with Asperger that have mixed thoughts of this film, others have completely negative ones and others even loved it, as I said each person's personality and their way to react can be completely different to other's thus I find it fraudulent to make an unfair condition they can't change outweigh and determine the whole complex personality of a person.",1,mary-and-max

9139,"Time for bed.Pain. Agony even. Fascinating to me to see the Studio Ghibli animation style applied to something, for the most part, so grounded in reality and the type of horror that only come from real war. You certainly don't need me to tell you it because I'm late to the party with this film, but Grave of the Fireflies pulls no punches in the way war film should. It's very good, beautifully animated, it features incredible voice acting and so many scenes that are either gorgeous or scarring. File it under the category that goes ""films that I think are great, but I never want to watch again"" with features like Schindler's List and 12 Years a Slave. Considering the stature of those other films, if you think someone is able to handle its emotional intensity, this makes for something worthwhile to show anyone who is still for some godforsaken reason holding onto the belief that animation is childish and only for younger audiences. The small bits that add a fantastical element to this, the titular fireflies, is also part of the secret sauce of what makes this so fitting to the realm of animation. It's a film about flickering lights, spirits that transcend time, and I think the phenomenal final shot this has is that proper grace note. The casualties of the war aren't just the soldiers, it's those that suffer behind the scenes, families left in agony on Earth. The most we can hope for then, since they should never forgive those Earthly actions, is for them to find peace and happiness in the afterlife. That part of them can be eternal, and those spirits look over us with the fireflies by their side. It has to stop happening, war is still eternal too, but there must be better.8.5/10",7,grave-of-the-fireflies
48315,"[55]”Yeesh, that’s some fancy camerawork!””Wow, this take has been going on forever!””How did they get this in a single shot?””I wonder if there was a hidden cut there…””Hmm, even the ‘still’ frames are handheld.””Is the camera moving forward? No…””Is this the same shot from earlier? Or was there a cut I missed?””Okay, the camera is definitely moving forward…very slowly.”--Me, the entire time.Therein lies the problem. A formal “dynamo”—scare quotes because what’s happening is impressive, technically, but also immensely distracting, to the point where I found myself focused more on what the camera’s physically doing and not what it’s showing. At least in something like, say, RUSSIAN ARK, the wizardry massages the camaraderie of the film’s Bigger Picture—it might be a gimmick but it’s a narratively relevant one (sort of), and therefore the “distraction” is, well, kinda part of the experience ; viz. we’re supposed to be gawking at the construction, among other things. I don’t think that’s what Cuarón had in mind, though; story sits somewhere uncomfortably between its mildly interesting execution and all the untapped potential (also wish the synopsis hadn’t mentioned the pregnancy, as it’d have made a nice midsection reveal). Set piece bravura is so busy spotlighting and hogging the stage that personal affection deeper than surface-level satisfaction barely registers. Ending is probably the best part, or more accurately, the only part that zapped me with any amount of emotional current—bittersweet, as most good endings are, and not as concerned with tracking, panning, or reframing that we can actually -- gasp -- comprehend the sacrificial catharsis on display. Being a bit harder on this than I should, maybe, because it was, for lack of a better word, “fun” to watch (also: neat, cool, groovy, august, entertaining, etc.).

49434,"I feel like, in response to growing up and realizing they’re not meant to be important artists or leaders or activists or whatever, and that they’re just living an ordinary adult life like the rest of us, certain millennials have doubled down on that disappointment from the high expectations they had in childhood and are now like, actually I am the *most* important person in every universe that exists. Multiversal main character syndrome.With an escalating mass mental health crisis underway in a country whose paltry private healthcare services are frequently out-of-reach to many, and inadequate for the lucky few who can even afford them, maybe it’s not a surprise that screen-damaged millennials have turned to making and consuming media as therapy. But should we have to be in the room while they process their solipsism and learned helplessness? Maybe if you’re a parent who wants to humor your child after they’ve been away at film school for years, and you want to see how your life savings were spent. The rest of us, though, have no such obligation, so we can safely abstain.As it turns out, I was right about this bullshit before I even watched it, so trying to say anything now feels redundant as elaboration on my well-justified skepticism, that it would demand anymore of my time and attention after wasting them so rudely already. I should’ve just Žižeked this and posted a review without even watching.I’d love to cut this thing to shreds in writing but — aside from it being chopped into meaningless, atrociously edited images already — it is something that can’t be written or thought about, a film flatly unwatchable. Like when someone shows you their phone and proclaims, “I can’t stop laughing at this,” but it’s two and a half interminable hours, and you have to pretend-smile and crack up along with them the whole time. (Or, like when you’re shown a Don Hertzfeldt film, maybe the closest comparable nadir in cinema.) I blame every rave review for the next decade of US cinema modeled on this. To my shock and dismay, I much preferred the last two Marvel movies I watched, both of which featured multiverses and, however clumsily, used them to some visual and emotive effect; what kind of supreme fuckups do you have to be for SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME to feel resonant in comparison? This was like the final boss of multiverse movies and, honestly, I’m not sure I won. It sure feels like I lost.

38620,"Absurdly good. A tactile, sweaty, volatile portrait of the desperation to escape poverty even when the odds are so heavily stacked in the favour of the capitalists willing to risk your lives for their profits. “Wherever there's oil, there's Americans”. The head of the oil company doesn’t give a shit about unions, doesn’t care if the people carrying the dangerous nitroglycerin across the South American terrain die. He knows that there will always be a line of people desperate for the money he’s offering, no matter how dangerous the job is.This thoroughly inhumane worldview fuels the film so well because it takes its time setting the scene before the word nitroglycerin even enters the picture. The South American setting is both a tangible powder-keg of tension and a strangely communal town at the same time. People get at each other’s throats because of the struggles they all face, but those same struggles often seem to bring people together. There’s definitely a sense of making the best of a bad situation, but that isn’t enough for some who draw revolvers at the slightest sense of conflict or who simply long for a better life that isn’t possible without serious cash. When the job becomes available, the situation becomes literally cut-throat and the opportunity to escape becomes a dangling carrot too irresistible. What follows is a gloriously entertaining ordeal to transport the nitroglycerin needed 300 miles away at an oil field. The struggle, the resourcefulness, the irony, the tragedy of this whole experience is filmmaking at its absolute best. This is one of those films where you can almost physically feel the dirt under a character’s fingernails, the salty sweat running into their eyes, the aching pain in the bones. It’s such a tangible, frighteningly real experience.What’s crazy is that I watched Sorcerer, William Friedkin’s 70s remake, a few years ago and didn’t like it much. Everyone told me to check this one out and I kept putting it off expecting a similarly disappointing experience. Honestly I don’t remember much of Sorcerer now but it certainly didn’t give me the kind of thrills, scares and awe The Wages Of Fear tore through me with.",9,the-wages-of-fear

3211,"Half-O-Ween 2021: Day 4Bad, but at least sort of weird enough to put it comfortably above average among Charles Band's directorial efforts -- not a particularly difficult challenge, but appreciated nonetheless.For one thing, it's set in some kind of post-apocalyptic future, for no obvious reason I can think of. It's not really important to the plot and doesn't come up often, and it's not like the movie has the budget for a lot of futuristic production design. But every once in awhile someone will pull a gun and it will fire lazer beams and you'll go ""oh yeah, I guess this is set in the future.""For another, it stars one of the most bizarre and off-putting protagonists I've ever seen in a movie; that would be Robert Glaudini, apparently a playwright (he wrote the play Jack Goes Boating which eventually became a Philip Seymour Hoffman film) and occasional actor (he's also in  MISSISSIPPI BURNING and THE PRINCESS DIARIES?), but here he plays the lead with such unfocused, strung-out weirdness that every scene becomes a bizarre parody of human interaction. There's sort of a narrative reason to play the character this way --he's both sick and morally ambiguous-- but it makes for a movie with a total charisma black hole at its center. And although there are a bunch of side characters rattling around (including a very young Demi Moore in her first major role, noticably terrible even in the context of this film) it certainly never finds anyone else to focus on (although it seems to gradually want to gravitate to horrible asshole Rictus [Luca Bercovici, director of GHOULIES!] and assume we're gradually going to come to love him?)Anyway, there is a parasite, and a pretty good one (by Stan Winston!) but I'm sorry to say that it's not in here even nearly enough to make it worth it. Mostly this is just dull and drab, though maybe it would have been more fun in its original 3-D? At least Band seems game to keep throwing things at the camera.",2,parasite

When you set a bar like Dial M for Murder and Rare Window, it's hard to expect anything bad.My main problem with this movie is that it's a little overdone. I'll even go so far as to say ""delusional."" Not only is the movie over two hours long, but nothing really happens during that time. The plot unfolds somewhere in the middle and the end you watch only because you ""have to"". The movie has good scenes and in general technically it is made well, especially for that time.

45992,"Always fun with my wife and I get to do a double feature. If we were trying to distance ourselves from the bleak worldview of Friends with Money we went the wrong direction. Still, I’ve always wanted to see this for the acclaim Theron’s performance always gets. It’s the stuff of legend. In fact, Roger Ebert said “This is one of the greatest performances in the history of the cinema.”I don’t think there’s any question to the skill, devotion, and realism the actress brings to the role. It’s a salute to the art of acting for its spectacle. There was a split room over Ricci’s work. I found it compelling and true to life. We’re a world away from Jenkins’s Wonder Woman, but the vibe is excellent. This struck me as a movie I would have loved as a college freshman. Because it’s so CRAZY and there are no rules and there’s a great big world out there and hey no way man I’m not justifying any of this but how COOL is that. This sort of thing.Interesting to package a serial killer biopic as a manic twee love story. Many of the scenes look like they’d fit neatly into one of those dreampop YouTube fan edits a la i’m cyborg but that’s ok. The movie walks a fine line between glamour and empathy but sticks the landing on the tragedy. There’s some fairly fine writing here too although the hand threatens to get heavy at times when we’re systematically taken through a museum exhibit on how every societal institution had come to fail her. There is the delicate dance of absolution against an honest depiction of her desperate circumstances. Ebert writes:“We are told to hate the sin but not the sinner, and as I watched ‘Monster’ I began to see it as an exercise in the theological virtue of charity. It refuses to objectify Wuornos and her crimes and refuses to exploit her story in the cynical manner of true crime sensationalism -- insisting instead on seeing her as one of God's creatures worthy of our attention. She has been so cruelly twisted by life that she seems incapable of goodness, and yet when she feels love for the first time she is inspired to try to be a better person.”I don’t think it lets anyone off the hook to say that circumstances can break a person and those of us who’ve had a better go can’t bow to the malevolent parts of our nature because we just add to it. We pile on the wickedness and it doesn’t dissipate but festers and trips another up in their way. What a cruel world. What have we added to it? And how can we push the opposite way? May God be merciful to us in this.",5,monster

This movie was a little weird for me because I had to keep reminding myself that it came out in 1982. The reason for that is because it was set in the 1990s when something has happened to change the world for the worse. It felt weird hearing someone mention the year when the stuff in the movie is nothing like how I remember the 90s. Anyway, a scientist has created a new parasite that could destroy what is left of humanity. One is inside him and he is working on figuring out a cure when he ends up in a small town. Someone from the government, a merchant as he is called, is following him and he has to deal with the locals who aren't always very nice.Besides the setting, I just found the story as a whole kind of weird and never got into it very much. The effects and the creature are kind of cool at least. I wasn't expecting them to be very good, but I was wrong for the most part. Nothing amazing, but good. It was also cool to see the weapons being used which are very different from what is even being used today. Not all of the characters had fancy weapons, but it was still cool to see laser weapons being used. What I didn't care for, besides just the story in general, was the acting. Now everyone was bad, but I just didn't care for the main character in the story. Maybe it was the character himself and not the acting, but either way, I just didn't care for him.

67242,"This is not a samurai film.  Well, that is not entirely true.  Samurai Rebellion is a late comer in the samurai movie genre.  Directed by Masaki Kobayashi and staring a Toshiro Mifune that is in the Autumn of his years, Samurai Rebellion is a kitchen sink drama set in imperial Japan.  This is royalty melodrama.  The Lord of the community kicks a woman out of his castle due to insubordination despite the fact that she bore him a son.  She is commanded to marry a commoner although neither party wanted to.Once the woman and man get together they find that they love each other deeply.  A wonder to the man's husband.  He who himself was forced into a planned marriage and who never felt love from or for his wife of 20 years.  The young couple also produce a daughter.Two years after the marriage of the common man and the lords refugee, the oldest son in the castle dies unexpectedly.  The lord then attempts to force the common family to hand over the very woman it dis-guarded 2 years ago in order to have the new heir to the throne's mother in the castle.  The young husband and his father refuse to hand over the woman despite the wishes of the rest of the family and community.  This will bring a battle to the front steps of their house.  I say this is a kitchen sink drama like those of the British new wave of the 60's because there is a lot of talking and not much action.  The final 20 minutes of the film contains the only battles or sword fighting.  At first I held this against the film.  I wanted to see more sword play from a film called Samurai Rebellion.  But as I look back on it I wish that more current films (and especially American movies) had this much well written drama with stakes this high.Allow me to sing the praises of Toshiro Mifune for a moment.  I will have to join the back of a long line of film critics and cinephiles in order to do so.  Mifune is the protagonist of many of the great Kurasawa films like Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Throne of Blood and Roshomon.  Usually I find his acting style a little too ""kabuki"" for me.  That is to say a little to theatrical or big.  The characters I have see him portray have always been larger than life and that put me off a little.  In this film however I felt that he was perfect.  A henpecked, sad sack of a man that finally sees what love looks like through his son's eyes.  At this point both father and son have an epiphany and in a way they both become ""men"" at the same time.This is a great movie for a snowy or rainy day.

Though the decision to film in black and white - a decision which I assume was meant to play off of the reductivism of classic horror - is understandable, it also feels unnecessary to the story being told. If we are meant to empathize with Merrick, why create that state of mind in the first place? Still, John Hurt, Bancroft, and Hopkins all do spectacular jobs in their respective roles. Hurt in particular conveys a tremendous amount through essentially one eye and half a mouth.

5800,"One of the most frustrating viewings I’ve had in a long time. I had insane expectations for No Greater Love especially considering I really clicked with Harakiri and Kwaidan, but this didn’t interest me at all. The film doesn’t do anything particularly wrong—it’s well-acted and shot attentively while covering an ambitious thematic task in an also ambitious runtime. I just didn’t care for any of it, and asking me to watch a three and a half hour film about a wartime labor supervisor just doesn’t sit right. I was looking forward to watching this entire trilogy but now my expectations are greatly lowered. I thought this was dull and emotionally-repetitive, while also failing to justify its draining runtime with the tame concept. Hopefully the other two parts make up for this. I still have a long day ahead of me after the underwhelming first part of this nine hour epic. The one part I did like was the uniting of all the prisoners as they chanted in the face of all the rifles aimed at them.

I do like the main character, ahmed. I think he's a sweet & innocent little boy and i quite fond him. I would also appreciate the minimalistic approach with the screenplay. But the rest was, oh my god, all the elders are very toxic, stubborn, unfriendly & annoying! Always yelling all the time while repeating the same acting & dialogues over & over again just for the film to fit the runtime, and that baffles me tbh. Not to mention that the pacing drags a lot too! And spoiler alert: for the ending, how's Ahmed's mother wasn't mad when Ahmed came home late? Because she used to be so rude to him. Also what's the point of going all around when Ahmed can do his friends homework???The reason i didn't rate it any lower is that it wasn't annoying as i thought it would be. But it still does annoying at some points! I get that it's trying to show us about how society treats kids. But still i would rather not see how it happened. It only remind me of bad days of mine.

34915,"The viewpoints of societal collapse, and the means of survival for four lost people attempting to achieve the same goal. Admittedly, the obviously enormous runtime intimidated me and kept me from watching this film for a long time. The director clearly poured his heart and soul into this, and it's tragic that we'll never see another film from him. It's dismal, really bleak—the characters spend much of the film delving into the complexities of defeatism. The film's gloomy, grey wash only adds to their thoughts and problems as we follow them on their lengthy journey. Even though much of the film is filled with misery and despair, the final section manages to turn the tables and challenge the pessimistic worldview.It's difficult to say exactly what this film meant to Hu Bo. I’ll admit that there was a lot of this that I didn't entirely comprehend. And I'll be honest: there were times when I felt so dejected for such a long time that I almost didn't want to keep going, but I'm glad I did. Now, to say I was entirely captivated for the entire runtime would be a lie, and I need more time to process this, but the film's artistic ambitions are not only evident, but also tremendously admirable and tragic. It's a challenging sit, which could be summed up as a visual representation of depression. There are no grandiose images or use of cliches—it is all about realism and struggle. This attempts to communicate a lot of stuff; some of it stuck with me, but some did not. As is the case with all works of art. But this is an incredible accomplishment, and the fact that the director is no longer present makes it all the more devastating. As someone who has dealt with a variety of mental health issues throughout the years, much of this was overwhelming for me. Concentrating on my own pain and feeling exactly like an animal trapped in a cage. I can easily see myself revisiting this in the future, and I believe that a film like this not only deserves, but almost demands, another viewing.//Reviewing this week exclusively on Reeltok Podcast PATREON",6,an-elephant-sitting-still

7927,"Enough of a reputation for being bizarre that I went all-in and watched the series leading up to the ending movie. Though I guess this isn't the only film to go with the end of the series. Also there's apparently other movies which reinterpret the events of the original series. I have no clue. I don't know enough about Anno Hideaki the man to really tease out how autobiographical this is supposed to be, although there's clearly some personal baggage being unloaded throughout this project. I do know that the lens through which the action takes place, Ikari Shinji, is one of the more unsympathetic and repellent protagonists that I've encountered. The series and the subsequent film are a struggle to get through because of it, and the psychedelic promise of The End of Evangelion was the carrot dangling from the proverbial stick in front of me that kept me going. It's not necessarily fair to measure something by your expectations, but them's the breaks sometimes. In the end, this was not worth the roughly half a day total of my life dedicated to coming into the film informed. Evangelion strikes me as a cynical, manipulative enterprise based on luring you in with red meat like kaiju and giant robots and then bait-and-switching you into listening to hours of whining by the series' profoundly unlikeable lead and by extension its creator. I can't imagine anyone would watch this without the Evas fighting a monster of the week in the early going, which explains why the more promising elements of the series never seem to find any traction, as Anno appears far more interested in the interior world of his disgustingly weak protagonist and his issues. More than anything the defining feature of Evangelion seems to be women in positions of authority who are just powerful enough to arouse fear in the men around them, but are ultimately stupid and ruled by their feminine emotions once they've finished science-ing whatever problem is being dealt with. Rejection by women is the dominant theme, and it's not one I'm all that interested in for a variety of reasons. After chopping my way through all of that vegetation, the crazy imagery was a disappointment. The show leans heavily on Abrahamic mysticism for its terminology and imagery, but Anno, again, doesn't seem to have use for examining anything except Shinji's interior misogyny, self-loathing, and apparent latent homosexuality towards the end. The repeated Biblical allusions never carry any weight because they have little to no thematic relevance to what's going on, apart from a bare sense of eschatology. The imagery is pushed to the limit in the film, but without any grounding it's more smoke and mirrors to lead me once again to Shinji's interminable whining. Weird for the sake of weird in order to bamboozle. Some credit where it's due. The film does finally pay off some of the excitement promised by its premise, briefly, in the scenes involving Asuka fighting the grotesque Eva-variants, and some actual emotion of the non-self-victimization variety is portrayed. The rawness of the violence and the stakes involved actually do prove moving, and finally provide some real depth to a character that up till that point was created to be just another bitch that Shinji was afraid of. Of course she's subsequently disemboweled and eaten alive before going right back to that archetype. Still, there's the glimmer of something that I actually want to see in there. Truth is a fundamental component of art, and I don't see a lot of truth here. I don't hold at all with the solipsistic view of depression that's present throughout most of the series. I don't like the misogyny, both from the characters and present in the writing. I find the camera's fixation on underage nudity repellent, and I think the show spends far more time on it than the narrative calls for. I especially don't like the treatment of Rei as a weird mix between a living, underage fuck doll (something which is really brought home in the scene where Ikari merges his hand into her and heads straight for her vagina) and mystical mother deity. Most of all, I don't care for the show validating Shinji's ongoing mental deterioration, which culminates in the desire to kill everyone because they won't accept him, by presenting as some sort of viable viewpoint which is in need of an answer. These elements are not presentations of facets of the human experience, but a combination of self-indulgence and an unhealthy fixation on the sexual availability of teenage girls. I'm certain I'm missing some cross-cultural context for a lot of this. I'm not all that interested in it. I'm not terribly invested in Anno's rationale for sticking his head up his ass.",2,neon-genesis-evangelion-the-end-of-evangelion

On the flip side, some great films do not need characters to care for or even despise. Sometimes the characters are just pawns in the grand scheme of something else.

62017,"Man, and I thought it was boring when I have to do the dishes!Of course I have to do them three times a day, if nobody else is going to. And laundry, so much laundry. It never ends. The kids throw their laundry in the basement, and here I am separating their underwear from their pants. Those buggers can't even take five seconds to separate their underwear out, so I'm stuck touching that filth every g--d--- day. Saturdays included. I wake up on Saturday and it's down to the laundry room for me, then back up to do the dishes left over from Friday night, then take out the trash.  Is it trash day?  Sometimes I forget trash day and then my garage is overflowing with trash. Of course I have to separate out my recycled materials from the trash, and they only come every other week. So is it the week for recycles or not?  Now go back to folding laundry.Then I watch this movie and it's Jeanne Dielman does the dishes, then Jeanne Dielman makes her bed, then Jeanne Dielman takes a bath.  I go to movies for the escape! I had to laugh when Jeanne cleaned the bathtub twice in two days. Not necessary, Jeanne. Neither do you need to polish those shoes on back to back days. I wouldn't even peel potatoes. Just leave the skins on: they're edible. When you're doing the Lord's work day after day, you've got to employ lifehacks!Reality aside, I get this movie, somewhat. It's an ordinary woman's life, day after day, unending house tasks, order masking chaos and heartache. This is one of the loneliest movies ever. The movie could be no shorter than it is. That creates a problem, though. It's monotonous for the sake of monotonous. We could rationalize this and say, ""well that's the point, it's an anti-blockbuster/anti-sensational Hollywood picture.""  Yes, though I dare say that most movies ever watched were not watched for the sake of monotony, just the opposite, and odds are it will likely remain that way.  We are told, if we read about this film, that the ending is wild and shocking. I found it rather predictable, given that this film is a complaint about the humdrum life of a regular woman, which it is.  In the middle of the film -- actually, maybe the 2:00:00 mark -- Jeanne's son randomly tells her, before they go to bed, that a man's penis is like a sword thrusting its way into a woman, and that's why he (the son) feigned nightmares as a kid, because he didn't want daddy to thrust it into mommy anymore.This is not exactly my kind of nighttime conversation with my mother, but anyway.The ""sword"" ""thrusting"" into the ordinary woman who, as one means of making money, conducts her own personal bordello in her flat -- well, what is going to happen in the end but another sword is thrust into another body?  Again, it is a woman's revenge flick, and did we not know that from the form and content after the first hour?Let me just defend housework for a second, which I have admitted that I hate myself.  It has to be done, and it has had to have been done for millions of years by somebody. I don't care who, male or female, rich or poor, it has and will be done.  It forms habits, and habits form character. I presume this is why people go off, in part, to monasteries, where they will be doing the same thing day after day.  Some people do in fact revel in the day after day, men and women alike.  Some people do in fact also see routine as a comfort, not a detriment to their ambitions, or whatever is happening in this film.Since this movie does not tell us much specific information about Jeanne, we don't know why exactly she ends up doing what she does in the end. We are left to infer, and then perhaps to universalize: ""if Jeanne does this, maybe all X feel this way,"" where X is usually equal to women, but could be modern bourgeois, or something like that. I feel, then, that the choice of this movie as the #1 movie ever by the 2022 BFI poll is a middle-finger to bourgeois movie-tastes dating back to the very beginning of film.  Much as I don't like most things produced by Hollywood, that I cannot get on board with.  It's not just that bourgeois society, despite many problems, is currently better than most of the alternatives. It's that this movie does not fit my criteria for ""great,"" which should mean that every shot, every transition, every aspect, is a doozy of a movie moment. And also: that every shot could be written about and would create an arresting book. Not just essay, but book.  Every shot should have a seemingly infinite number of possibilities and insights that you could write 200 pages on.  I don't see that as being true here.To rescue this film, however, it does have much to teach us: exquisite attention to detail is as about as exacting as you can get, placement of camera is an Ozu special, and then the variation in the second and third days on the first day is occasionally fun to notice, and then tease out what it might mean.  I say ""occasionally"": this film is so long that those occasions happened too infrequently for me, and as I said, knowing that the ending would be ""wild"" actually ruined the effect of it.In the end for me, maybe bourgeious society stinks, yet most of us are alive and not dead because of it. I do like running water and my gas stove, or any stove I could get. Also indoor plumbing and pretty easy access to food and dentistry. Imagine if they made ""Jeanne Dielman 2350 BC.""  She'd be lugging water from the well several times a day, gathering fuel for fire, slaughtering animals, swatting flies around the carcasses, taking care of sick and dying children. Imagine the blood and sweat and tears in that movie!  Maybe more entertaining?",4,jeanne-dielman-23-quai-du-commerce-1080-bruxelles
61931,"Jeanne Dielman is probably not as monstrous as my rating suggests. Technical wise it's superb, with static, exquisitely composed shots and a pleasing color palette to counterbalance the excruciating nature of the story. Chronicling a Belgian widow's life for a span of three days, Jeanne Dielman is almost painfully patient with its storytelling. The first day was documented with abundant intimacy and details, as we are offered a fascinating peek into the titular character, Jeanne Dielman's obsessive, almost ritualistic way of living, cooking for his son, buying groceries, and the most shocking of all, prostituting in her own house to make ends meet. Everything was presented with enough poise and style, thanks to Delphine Seyrig's naturalistic portrait of the woman who appears extremely put together, despite a deeply tormented psyche. As a poignant character study of a woman suffering from loneliness and a repetitively mundane existence, the first day is simply filmmaking in its most magnificent form.What really ruined it completely for me is the boredom caused by the following days, which is almost a carbon copy of the first day, except with several minor or major variations that echo its feminist theme. If there's a twist coming, you would most likely see it from miles away, and the second half simply bets its life on that twist to work. It's simply a chore to sit through knowing much of what's yet to come you've seen from the first hour or so. I don't typically have a problem with long movies with little or no variations, but I just don't think it's wise to make a point opting for the brute forces, when there are already logarithmic methods out there with equally satisfactory results.

8350,"Ingmar Bergman’s characters are beaming false smiles to mask their insecurities throughout much of the early scenes of Autumn Sonata. The overdrive of neurotic dialogue is perpetual; even when one character has a moment of solitude that said character over-analyzes aloud everything we are watching. There’s no contemplative moment for us to reflect without Bergman’s words jamming into our ears.This was the final film of actress Ingrid Bergman (“Casablanca”) who got to speak in her native tongue. Here she plays the mother Charlotte, a busybody celebrated pianist who has traveled the globe, now aged, and has decided to slow down enough to visit her daughter Eva (Liv Ullmann) who she hasn’t seen in seven years. Eva is married to a dedicated man but is stuck in a rut of unhappiness in her life; she is a published writer who cannot enjoy anything without worrying about the well-being of others first.After much fussy dialogue, we learn how selfish Charlotte has been in her life—to the point she’d rather not see her other daughter Helena (Lena Nyman) at the house because she’s disabled and that illness makes her uncomfortable. Eva has never been a good wife or mother, and there’s a couple of suppressed tragedies that have rarely been spoken of that gradually come to the surface over the weekend.The rare time any of them shuts up is when they play the piano; Eva plays Prelude No. 2 by Chopin, and then Charlotte plays it again to show off how it’s supposed to be played. Eva stares into her mother with the kind of resentment that comes when somebody is trying to one-up you. Ingmar Bergman is a brilliant filmmaker whose body of work will last throughout the ages, but there are times when some of his films test your patience. You have to ask of certain titles, is this Big News? For some, to watch Ingmar direct Ingrid was something of a big deal. But to me the only big news here is that it might cause some viewers to fall into the Depression Zone for not enough good reason to justify that feeling.Some honest praise? There’s a brilliant image about 54-minutes in, it’s a flashback. Young Eva is waiting at the drawing doors for her mother Charlotte to stop with her piano practice. When the music breaks, Eva adoringly comes in to serve coffee to her mother who is so oh-so-dramatically-wiped-out from practice. It takes less than a minute for mother to say she would rather be alone and would “prefer” her daughter to go out and play so she can read the newspaper instead of engaging with her.At the 64-minute mark is Ullmann’s electric monologue about how she always felt ugly and injured because of her mother. It made me consider that if the rest of the film had been parsed down to its bare essentials then maybe the film as a whole would have been a truly significant film in Bergman’s canon.",4,autumn-sonata

I'm still a whole lot better off here.That's what YOU THINK! BWAH-HA-HA-HA! No, this movie is NOT the amazing 2019 Bong Joon Ho film about social structures in society. This is about genetically engineered parasites. For those who know, I'll just say the following: Directed by Charles Band. If you know what that means you can opt-out of the remainder of this review as you already know what's coming whether you've seen the movie or not.Are they gone? Cool! For anyone who is left, this is EXACTLY as bad as you think it's going to be. The only real reason to watch this movie is because it features Demi Moore in her first acting role!

Toss in a rare film appearance by Runaway vocalist Cherie Currie as part of a tribute act to the punks in Return of the Living Dead and you're well on your way to answering some REALLY obscure movie trivia. As for the rest of the film, you've got a scientist who was TOTALLY COOL with creating bio-engineered parasites for the Good ol' US of A but when he found a Mega Corporation behind the whole thing had a sudden crisis of conscious. His efforts to destroy it fail and he winds up infected. Scientist goes on the run, EvilCorp gives chase... etc. etc...  What really confuses me is... why even create a parasite in the first place?

A man is pushed to his limits to get the fame and glory of his idol, a man who lives solely in fantasy and never in reality. De Niro gives possibly his best performance ever in this, the way he plays Pupkin is both sad and hilarious.

16183,"One of the best films of Soviet cinema I’ve ever seen, is a seminal work that spectacularly creates a visual symphony that transcends the limits of a narrative we’ve already seen in other films. Each piece of this film is so detailed, with cinematography that masterfully accompanies the deep immersion of the raw emotions of love and loss in the midst of the tumultuous and destructive World War II. Director Kalatozov presents us with a frighteningly yet beautiful narrative about the fragility of human feelings and abandonment, but also about the power of hope in the face of an imminent disgrace.This masterpiece follows the journey of Veronika, a young woman in love, trapped in the turmoil of war, who previously navigated the complexities of love, and now navigates through sacrifice and resilience in a world torn apart by conflict. The use of various visual symbolism is present, which is impressive considering that it was made in the Soviet Union, but here each metaphor resonates in the indomitable human spirit, rising above the ruins of war and tragedy in search of redemption and a meaning.While we follow with a tight heart the subtle life, but also the emotional tumoil and internal struggles of Veronika, Kalatozov throws contemplations directed at us with deep existential questions that arise in times of crisis. The representation of the horrors of war in the film is incredibly well crafted, but there are moments of a juxtaposition of tenderness and compassion, showing that the complex interaction of light and darkness, hope and despair, defines the human experience in such terrible moments.The cinematography is amazing; I could praise it forever. With his long signature takes and dynamic movements, it gives us a sense of urgency and immediacy about what is happening in the film, making it much more pleasant to us immerse ourselves in the visceral intensity of Veronika’s journey. Filmed in black and white in a frighteningly beautiful way, the film dodges by moments of strong visual contrast and striking composition, incredible editing and the use of fast-paced shots, paying homage to silent movies of past decades. I found it impeccable.The incredible direction of Kalatozov is not the only attractive thing; the stellar performance of actress Tatyana Samoylova in the role of Veronika is breathtaking; she shares with open arms the feeling of her character with the audience, and elevates together with the entire crew The Cranes Are Flying to the realm of film art, leaving a striking impression on the history of cinema.An impeccable film that confronts, together with those who watch, the complexities of humanity itself and with the eternal questions of love, loss and hope that define our lives. One of the films that I would strongly like to have more recognition, because it is just perfect.— thanks for reading!",9,the-cranes-are-flying

Além da visão crítica em referência a violência e imprevisibilidade da mãe natureza, e o respeito que temos que ter por ela, entretanto é uma experiência lenta que te coloca em uma espiral muitas vezes de falta de localização de momentos mais marcantes, em suma é uma experiência contemplativa entre dois homens se chocando em um ambiente imprevisível em que o companheirismo prevalece sobre tudo isso.

In addition to the critical view in reference to the violence and unpredictability of mother nature, and the respect we have to have for her, however, it is a slow experience that puts you in a spiral, often with a lack of locating the most memorable moments, in short, it is a contemplative experience between two men clashing in an unpredictable environment in which companionship prevails over it all.

4460,"The moral bar is too low if history can redeem Oskar Schindler. In an era filled with Jewish heroes of nazi resistance, why lionize a capitalist who was comfortable with the ghettoization of jews so long as it allowed him to exploit labor at slave wages? The overt sadism of Goethe is one side of Nazi evil; Schindler's represents another. One who might be uncomfortable with mass extermination, but who thrives on the creation of a permanent underclass of Jews to make money. Capitalists like Schindler's undoubtedly helped lay the groundwork for the Nazi's worst crimes.One disturbing aspect of this film arises repeatedly when the Jewish individuals in hiding turn away other Jews. Routinely, the Jewish people are treated as set pieces lacking agency. It is Schindler who beams empathy and who bestows salvation on the wretched. I cannot get behind this persecutor moonlighting as a savior revisionism. Any system of oppression is filled with profiteers of misery like Schindler, and none deserve praise. Despite its brutality and evil, real stories of the holcaust contain visions of equality,  resilience, courage, solidarity, perseverance, and resistance.

19443,"Sir, let those laugh that win.Am I going to be the asshole that looks himself in the mirror and says to himself ""Barry Lyndon is boring, needlessly long, and just not very good."", then proceed to type that out on Letterboxd dot com? I suppose tonight, yes, yes I am. I just did not connect with this at all, and it easily made for the most disappointing watch I've had in some time. I can at the bare minimum say this is a nice-looking film. The camerawork, the costumes, a lot of effort was clearly put into the aesthetic aspects of the film, and you will never, ever hear me remotely say that Stanley Kubrick is a bad director. Maybe I just didn't get it. Exploring identity as a core concept of a story should be right up my alley, and with Stanley no less being someone who I think has a hard grasp on the human condition, this should be a match made in heaven. Above anything else, if I had to point out one thing that made Barry Lyndon so middling for me, it comes down to Barry himself. I never found Barry to be an interesting person to watch. I don't think the actor playing him was bad, yet I never exactly found him particularly good. (There's one dramatic moment later on that I can't talk about because of spoilers, and you can probably figure out what it is, that was the only bit of true emotion I felt like I got out of Barry.) The complexities of his assumed identities I get are supposed to be a part of his character, but I didn't feel like I got to know who he was before his journey, nor who he was as he settled into wealth. So, he's just a rich asshole? Okay. Oh, he loves his kid? Why am I being told this over narration instead of seeing that bond develop? You got a three hour runtime Stanley, maybe use it, just a tiny bit? By the time it reached its end, I was silently chanting in my head for it to wrap itself up, and with any movie, that's a pretty notable problem. The point may have gone over my head entirely, or, maybe if it weren't for the name ""Kubrick"" attached to it, it would a period piece forgotten by time.

Certainly, this type of indifference to aging generations happens, but Make Way for Tomorrow presents it in a way that's too narratively consistent and depressingly spelled out.  At a young age my grandparents lived with their children until health and care required a different approach.  Convenience was never really the issue.  This is just one of those things that no matter how much it tears on your heartstrings, I found the misery too distant from my own experience to connect with.

Norma Desmond, a presence that once charmed the screen, now lives a reclusive life haunted by her own past self. She spends her time reliving the moments the spotlight was still on her, unaware that the world has long moved on without her. The faded glamour has taken a toll on her like the rats infesting her empty pool, but Norma remains oblivious, clinging on to every shred of false hope. Gloria Swanson captures the loneliness and desperation of the aging artist perfectly. The queen of the silent era  dominates the screen with her strong presence  — her sharp stares, desperate pleas and uncanny charm makes her the show stealer.

Good Will Hunting evoked very little empathy out of me; the story revolving around the titular character felt very  preachy.  The message saying that it is alright to take chances while running the risk of regret or negative experiences is fine enough, but I just cannot stand the underlying reassertion of intelligence being some objective indicator of where a person ""deserves"" to be in life (a completely classist fabrication, by the way) and the jokes that clearly have not aged well at all regarding therapy, women, and other things included in the script that were obviously included to lessen the emotional burden of the plot.

54946,"Cold, grey skies and empty streets. Tall, imposing structures make up the brutalist architecture that confines. Large, plain concrete blocks. The gloomy aesthetic that The Lives Of Others presents is an extension of the state of 1980’s East Germany. A totalitarian government controls all, and art is being silenced. Everyone is a suspect. It’s only when Wiesler, an agent of the Stasi, is ordered to spy on an unsuspecting couple (both of whom’s lives are revolved around art) that he begins to contemplate why their lives are richer than his. His life becomes juxtaposed against theirs, theirs being full of life and meaningful work that they enjoy, his being dull and meaningless. Their apartment is literally full, and his secret base in the loft of their building is, aside from the technological equipment used to eavesdrop, empty. When the film is over and the credits roll, it’s easy to see it as a warm and fulfilling finale but it’s not, the tragic event that precedes the ending is a harrowing case of unwilling sacrifice- but it’s hard to wonder if there was ever a way that it could have played out differently. Ulrich Mühe, who can be recognised from his earlier collaborations with Michael Haneke in Benny’s Video and Funny Games, gives a stellar performance, but what impresses me most of all is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s debut feature, and it’s one that’s so maturely directed and complex in its themes.",6,the-lives-of-others

82253,"============================Letterboxd Season Challenge 2017-18============================Week 17: January 15th-21stBritish New Wave WeekBased on Barry Hines' 1968 novel ""A Kestrel for a Knave,"" this film directed by Ken Loach provides an unsettling portrait of life in Barnsley, a Yorkshire mining area, during the mid-20th century, when Britain's coal industry was in decline. The main character is a fifteen-year-old boy named Billy Casper (David Bradley), who lies and steals, is bullied at school by classmates and browbeat by teachers, while at home by his older half-brother Jud (Freddie Fletcher) picks on him. Billy works mornings before class as a newspaper delivery boy. On weekends, he likes to go ""nesting,"" hiking the countryside looking for bird's eggs. One days he sees a kestrel nesting in an ancient wall and decides he wants to train one of baby falcons. He tries to borrow a book from the town library, but he has no membership thee, so he goes to a used bookstore and shoplifts a copy of a book called ""Falconry."" Sunday morning early, he goes to the kestrel nest and captures one of the offspring, which he names ""Kes.""Of necessity, Loach has to take time to give us a primer on training falcons, from where to keep them, how to feed them, moving them outdoors, using a ""creance"" (tether) to prevent their escape and getting them to come on command. Billy's success in this area is counterbalanced by his complete failure playing football (soccer) at school and being dressed down by the headmaster for minor transgressions. Ah, but part of growing up is to learn that we don't live in a fair world.In time, Billy reveals to his classmates how he has trained Kes and they are pretty much in awe. Who does something like that? But it also arouses jealousy, and Billy has to fight for his honor. Fortunately, his English teacher Mr. Farthing (Colin Welland) takes an interest in Billy's hobby and comes to watch a training session. He's impressed by Billy's accomplishment, but even more so by the bird. It's magnificent in its wildness.The problem, of course, is that reality doesn't bend to our will. Boys must grow up and find jobs. Birds must fly free or die in captivity. But isn't Billy a bit like a wild bird in the cage of society? And isn't his entrapment threatening if not life-threatening? It's not a situation with an easy way out.This film was a darling of the BAFTAs, winning Bradley an award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles and Welland the prize for Best Supporting Actor. It also earned nominations for Best Picture, Best Direction (Loach) and Best Screenplay (Loach, Hines and Tony Garnett).",6,kes

Yes. Alien rip-offs have been done to death but there are enough good ideas in Parasite that I'd welcome a remake of it. Up the budget, add some star appeal (I can see Plaza or Johansson in the Demi Moore role but there's no shot in hell they'd sign on), fill the bit roles with some vaguely familiar faces and update the effects, and you might have something.On its own, Parasite does not warrant a revisit. The dialogue is stiff and unnatural, the chestbursting thrills are few and far between, and what would be the most interesting parts of the movie - the atomic bombing of America and the labour camps - are only teased at in those boring conversations.

I was going crazy trying to figure out where I had heard the song before when the event can't on, but I was able to put my finger on it eventually.

48547,"As the sound of the playgrounds faded, the despair set in. Very odd, what happens in a world without children's voices.I went into this film knowing next to nothing. I knew a bit of the cast and that it had so much praise behind it, but I knew nothing of the story or why it was good.It's simultaneously beautiful and disgusting, and I loved every moment. The dystopia is so dark and filthy, but more than anything it feels depressingly real. The cinematography is stunning, it captures the world and characters so beautifully and effortlessly, and brings you right into the action every chance it gets. It has a close intimacy during its thrilling scenes, only ramping up the tension every chance it gets.Alfonso Cuarón said he wanted to make a film that's doesn't just end with the credits, but something that sticks with you long after its over, and this more than succeeds at it. Children of Men is a stunning film, both inside and out. The journey the characters are taken on, the changes they go through, while it might not be the most unpredictable on a base level, the film does so much with these characters to captivate the audience and leave them thinking about it long after, about what happens to these characters after the credits roll, and what's to come, more than a typical movie might.Finding the proper words for this was more difficult than I anticipated, and it's one that I feel you'll only appreciate more on a rewatch, but even on a first viewing there's so much to take in and love.",9,children-of-men
1862,"- World Cinema Is The Best Cinema -This is without a doubt, one of the best “detective thriller” films I’ve seen. It was beautifully written, very intense and masterfully acted. There really isn’t anything else you need for a film like this. High and Low is the first Kurosawa film, that I’ve seen, that doesn’t involve samurais and not to my surprise, he didn’t need them to make something incredible.  I’m fairly new to Kurosawa and I’ve only really seen a hand full of his films, which include the likes of Rashomon, Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, Ran and Sanjuro. I’ve loved every one of them. He’s one of a few filmmakers that I actually get excited to see their work. Along with him, is Toshiro Mifune. I can’t get over how cool that man was. He absolutely nailed the characters I have seen him play. So far my favourite performance by him was in Yojimbo. Too good!",8,high-and-low

Even though i couldn't get engaged with the story, I found it easy to get lost in its atmosphere due to the brilliant film-making techniques that were put into this. Incredible performances and though-provoking dialogue really sets the mood. I think i was scared of this film; and that's the weird thing. The personification of Death terrified me and now i just don't feel the same way. Even in scenes that were more lighthearted, i could still feel the powerful presence of death looming over the screen. That's the beauty of this film, even if it was presented like strange, bad dream.I think I'm gonna need a while to recollect my thoughts on this, so i shall see if my feelings change over time.

58524,"At the Oscar ceremony in 1990, Dead Poets Society was nominated in four categories, winning one. Director Peter Weir was nominated, but Rob Reiner (for When Harry Met Sally...) wasn't, despite having helmed a genuinely funny, sweet and intelligent romantic comedy. The film itself was nominated, and yet Crimes and Misdemeanors - one of my favourite films of all time, which explores existential themes such as guilt, morality and self-expression - was not. Dead Poets Society's Tom Schulman won Best Original Screenplay over both of these films, in a category that also included the ground-breaking Do the Right Thing. This is surely one of the worst things the Academy has ever done.I appreciate that I am pretty alone in my opinion of this film (although Roger Ebert, Gene Siskel and Pauline Kael weren't fans either) and in some ways it's easy to see why. It is about an 'inspirational' teacher (played by Robin Williams, who, to be fair, is actually quite good) who teaches his students the most important lesson of all: 'life'. My initial problem with the film was the schmaltz, particularly when the boys pull what is referred to by some as the 'Spielberg face'. I felt I could probably get over this, but the ending made it much worse. My next problem was that Keating (Williams) didn't really seem at all inspiring. The boys don't study poetry with him, they memorise it and quote it at random to convince themselves that they are free-spirited and special. They resurrect Keating's Dead Poets Society (which he formed as a student of the school), but rarely spend the meetings reading poetry. Yes, they clearly have an appreciation of the art, but it's an appreciation that barely scratches the surface. In fact, the only reason they seem to like Keating so much is that he is fun and different, which makes a change from the stuffy, uptight, more old-fashioned teachers. However, my biggest problem with the film is the 'twist' that sets off the third act. One of the boys does something that's supposed to be shocking and heart-breaking, but which I thought was awkward, ill-judged, poorly handled and - worst of all - unconvincing. When the boys stand on their desks at the end to salute Keating, I was a bit confused. Not at what was happening, but because it seemed meaningless. He hadn't done anything for them whatsoever, and this kind of sums up my feelings of the film as a whole: there is barely any depth, it has plot contrivances which hinder any possible 'truth', and it amounts to very little, if anything at all. My dislike of Dead Poets Society isn't because I don't appreciate literature or poetry, because I do, and I'll admit that the concept of 'carpe diem' is an interesting and thought provoking one, even if few people can admit to living by it. But I would have been a lot more inspired if there was actually something here to be inspired by.",1,dead-poets-society

53669,"How many music montages does one movie need? There's a point in this film where there are two in a row. And for a film that's already overlong, that's not a good thing. Indulgent is the best word to describe this. It's just edited so poorly. A lot needs to be taken out - and could be, with zero impact on the story. And it's not even a good story. The emotional core is there, but apart from that, the only thing incredible is how ordinary it all is. Ordinary and unnecessary. The scene with Franco Nero accomplished nothing whatsoever, apart from adding a few minutes to the running time. Same deal with the bags. Who is the target audience for this...2nd graders? This movie should be half as long as it is. I knew something was awry when the heroes use the same trick twice (swiped from The Three Musketeers, naturally) to show they are bounty hunters after killing their targets. When a movie duplicates a scene nearly verbatim and fails to advance the story any further, it became abundantly clear (as it does whenever I watch a QT movie) that someone needs to be hired to supervise Tarantino. He's like a child with free reign of the playground. And I mean child literally. Snowy snow? Last chance fancy pants? If any other writer on Earth, regardless of age, wrote that into their story, they would be flogged in the street and condemned from handling writing instruments for life. Hey, why not throw in some completely anachronistic hip-hop because there's black people in it!The biggest problem, however, was the plan to rescue the wife. Why didn't the doctor just go into Candy Land (we're dealing with a child, remember?) on his own, use the whole German language dupe to get Mr. Candie to notice their connection, and then offer to buy her for a good price? That would work without a hitch.It makes complete and utter sense and everyone wins. Only problem is...movie ends right there. So, instead of logic prevailing, we're treated to another hour of sheer contrivance for the sake of adding another hour to the running time. And shoehorning in a bunch of action because the puerile mind behind it all couldn't come up with anything that did make sense. Or to avoid shame by preventing the film from showing on Nickelodeon, as it would if it wasn't full of squibs so bloody, Paul Verhoeven probably jacks-off to them (schoolboy humor...figured it was appropriate). It doesn't help that QT is a pretty bad director. Every time I see an interesting/cool shot or moment or scene in one of ""his"" films, I can only think 'I wonder what movie that came from...', because you know it didn't come from him. He can't even come up with original titles anymore. But it's not just his complete reliance on homage (codeword for ripping off and getting away with it). He doesn't know how to utilize the language of cinema. There's more to it than recreating a shot and borrowing some lines from a movie you saw in 1976. He doesn't know how to make anything feel real or consequential. The humor is forced, the tension is artificial, the emotion is not earned. The guy just doesn't get it. If you came for the style, you can be entertained while watching it, but with no sense of gravitas whatsoever, there's nothing to take with you once the movie is over. It you came for the substance, you'll leave empty-handed. You gain no insight and feel no real emotion.  There are two instances in this movie where the lead character threatens to pull out his gun when there are 8 or 9 bad guys right next to him (I'd list names, but I don't know who the fuck they were because they were never developed in any way other than 'bad guy'). We know you're not going to whip out your gun, blow your cover, and engage in a shootout after just meeting these cardboard cut-out adversaries in the middle of the god damn movie. It's just thrown in because that's what QT thinks constitutes as tension. His understanding of how to show the viewer that the hero cares for his wife begins and ends with 'kill bad guys'. It's dummy film-making at its most dumb. This movie is just plain childish and stupid. The script should have been hung on a refrigerator door, because that's right where it belongs.PS: It's nice to see Leo delivering yet another spot-on Leonardo DiCaprio impression, but I think it's time he remembered how to act. This is the kid from Gilbert Grape? Not any more. He always plays himself. He never elevates material. Has two emotional ranges: on and off.

It also has some very good cinematography, especially towards the end with the whole carnival.

40861,"It's impressive how David Lean can make a story this small scaled feel truly epic. I think this lies in how personal the whole thing is. It definitely has the best, or rather my favorite, use of narration I've seen in a film. Yes, narration is mostly used as a way of getting us into the character's mind, but here it's used to create something powerful. It creates this fantasy-like feeling inside Laura's head as she recounts her memory of Alec to her husband but rather than it being conveyed to him verbally, it all happens in her mind as an imagining of the last moments of honesty between them. And it wouldn't work without Celia Johnson's truly brilliant performance. She conveys melancholy, regret and guilt so perfectly.Talking about acting, Trevor Howard is also quite incredible. Except being extremely charming and charismatic, his chemistry with Celia that stands out. But it would not be complete without Noel Coward's simply incredible dialogue. Besides being witty and hilarious sometimes, it also creates some of the best dramatic and romantic confrontations I have seen. It's such a short story but it's filled without being overblown. It's a cycle type story that uses the technique to it's fullest.I have heard of David Lean as a director, who is concerned with his visuals and was interested in what he does with a film like this and his use of lighting stuck out to me the most. When Laura is lost in her thoughts and shadows close in on her it really elevates those scenes of inner thinking. Brief Encounter is much like, the already masterful, In The Mood For Love but even better. It's an unethical love story of 2 people surrounded by easy love of other people, limited by their train trips every week. Also how brilliant it is to make an 88 minute long film and call it ""Brief Encounter"" ? It's all so delicate.",9,brief-encounter
45731,"Undeniably made with good intentions and I appreciate the unexploitive approach given the type of story this is, but I found the writing to be too superficial and poorly constructed (the voiceover narration itself felt completely unnecessary and the decision to focus more on the romance comes at the expense of diving deeper into Aileen Wuornos’ psychological and traumatic pain) and the direction to be rather flat. The cinematography in particular made it feel like a late 90s/early 2000s Lifetime Original Movie and I found some of the music choices to be very out of place. It’s just a rather dull film in my opinion, which is shocking given the seemingly interesting story that inspired it.That said, Theron does her best, even though I feel her performance is hindered by the weak material.",2,monster

39767,"Film #56 that was recommended to me -- feel free to add to the list! (Recommended by yondu4)I must be honest, I entered this film with the vague idea that the director had based it on his own life, and literally nothing else. I'm not particularly opposed to musicals, but there's a whole world there that I haven't really explored. Luckily, I watched with a couple people who could fill in some blanks for me. Like, Ann Reinking was really a woman in Bob Fosse's life, now playing the role of herself in this film. That's interesting, and honestly quite impressive of her to be able to handle it.Whether due to my ignorance, or just some unique editing choices, the opening of All That Jazz was pretty rough. It's hard to get a handle on people's relationships to each other, with not really enough context to care (for a while), and it's even harder to get a sense for time. There's a flashback to ""Joe Gideon's"" earlier life that I only realized near the end wasn't a whole new character. To a degree, I appreciate that the film flows so freely; there's an energy to the whole thing, but there had to have been a better way to communicate elements of it. Feeding off of that, it took ages to really care about the protagonist. He's a bad dude, recognizing the harm he causes to other people, but not really caring to change. In a meta sense, assuming Bob Fosse never got any better, this film can be seen as a selfish hypocrite announcing ""haha aren't I selfish?"" to the whole world in place of, you know, changing anything at all. I'm not opposed to films about selfish people; I love some of Cassavetes' stories about his grossest characters, but it's hard to look at the musical numbers and not see at least a bit of a celebration of this life, a slightly too fond look back at everyone he hurt. To me it's presented more as a reminiscence than the condemnation some people see.All that said, I do adore the second half. The film becomes more surreal and non-literal, and it's all the better for it. The final musical number lasts so long that I slipped from being enraptured to wondering why they hadn't wrapped it up minutes ago, but everything else is great. A Broadway judgment of the soul is inherently fascinating, even if Fosse ultimately can't quite seem to imagine that anything could've been different. At least there's a sense of humor about it.",6,all-that-jazz
37461,"I think it's fair to say at this point that I hate the Coen Brothers. Not them personally mind, just their movies. I've seen the best they had to offer, and I'm not impressed. Hail Caesar failed at being a comedy, Fargo was a farce, and then there was this.Now for the first hour and 15 minutes, I was actually really enjoying myself. It was a quiet and tense western, with an outstanding villain in Anton Chigurh. I was reconsidering my opinion of the Coen Brothers, thinking maybe I had given them a bad rep like I had for Wes Anderson. But then last 40 minutes happened and it all went to shit.First Josh Brolin gets killed off scene by some random Mexicans, which just came out of nowhere, why was that the case? Then movie drags its feet for ages with scenes that feel absolutely pointless. And then there's the ending, good god the ending got under my skin.Tommy Lee Jones talks about some cock and bull story about some dream he had, which I can't for the life of me figure out it's relevance to the rest of the movie, and then the movie just ends. Why does it end there?! It's so stupid, did the writers not know how to end it or something?! What should have been a solid western turned into a irritating mess of a movie.

39922,"between decadence and decay, the glitz & glamour of the show biz sparkling bright enough to try and make us overlook the systemic pain and suffering which upholds it, we have all that jazz - the self-reflective work of bob fosse. it comes with all the frills: simultaneously a showcase of work he was a part of + a condemnation of his wrongdoings, directed by the man himself. it starts off with an energizing intro and contains dance numbers which all go down as personal highlights of the film for me (except for one). they're sprawling with physical energy and talent - with the editing framing and underscoring them beautifully - a real sight to behold. when it comes to the criticism levied by the film against the protagonist and director stand-in himself, there is an odd layer of inhibition. it goes to great lengths to paint gideon (fosse) as a troubled and overworked artist who can't seem to escape the vicious cycle of hurting the ones he loves, inflicting pain on women in his life and taking advantage of them. scenes where he talks to (or rather flirts with) an angel of death in form of a mysterious woman played by jessica lange try to add a surreal and mystifying aspect to it. as if fosse was trying to dispel these myths and complications around his actions and life's trajectory for us, yet even while doing so he couldn't abstain from framing women as his downfall. maybe this wouldn't have bothered me half as much as if the scenes highlighting the ways in which he wielded his position of power over the dancers weren't depicted in a lot of half-truths, downright minimizations or even glaring omissions of things he's done. exclusions such as when he exposed himself to a 16 year old dancer, his belief sex between performer and director improved the dancer's work, how he pimped out dancers to studio executives. it's questionable how he framed the nurse in the second half of the film seemingly enjoying herself when she lays in bed with him, when in reality there were so many advances/gropings by fosse to the point the hospital had to hold a private conference' because of him. it's a distorted retelling of events and it's hard for me to not see it as fosse getting ahead of the wave and confessing seemingly all the bad things he did and cinematically rendering his perspective on them so no one else could say he isn't aware of them. with the framing during the entirety of the film and the final number (in my opinion!) underscoring the ways in which he feels absolved and can laugh it all off, it does not only make the self-flaggelation, the purported admittance of all faults feel insincere, to me felt like it downplayed the sexual predator aspect that was a key part of fosse's career. he was a man in a positon of power who abused his power for sex. defending him under the guise of painting him as a 'womanizer' does not only erase the abusive, coercive and non-consensual sexual encounters women have made with fosse, it excuses them. it's why I think fosse painting himself as as a tortured genius who was addicted to (coercing) sex (with your position of power) doesn't work. it lacks nuance and depth. and ATJ felt to me like it was operating on this half-hearted vibe more than half the time, a lá, 'yes, we're gonna touch on some of the bad things he did but look at all the cool things he's created!', which made the film veer too much into the territory of polishing the mistakes made instead of owning up to them, which in turn caused the grievances exercised to lose their authentic, sincere sheen. // i think if this film was mainly compromised of dance numbers, i would've liked and even loved it, but the gideon/fosse aspect really soured it for me! still planning to give cabaret a shot.",1,all-that-jazz

Not because of the ideas that arise in it, or even some of the scenarios, or hell even the whole idea of a mosaic film. It's the film's structure of how things play out and how every story's conflicts and pacing builds and recedes gradually.To point this out definitively, notice how the initial start of this film is a slow but involving explanation of the ideas that will be brought up in the film. Then all of a sudden it hits, and a very active ""One"" sung by Aimee Mann plays as we're introduced to all our characters in a very hyper mode, as if PTA is shouting ""GO GO GO"" to his audience to memorize each character and their current function. From here the film settles into a groove whereby every now and then, it will slow down, and then pick up, and then slow down, and speed up, and then slow down. It's a hell of a ride, and like every drug induced experience, when you come down, it's either gonna hit you with a sense of meaningfulness or you'll come down empty.I'd say I came down empty but understood the meaningfullness others took for it.

The psychatrist’s idea was that thought, ideas, can be a virus. Once a certain idea about a person takes hold, it can spread like wildfire.""Interviewer: ""In the film, after the man is wrongly accused, the whole village turns against him.""Vinterberg: ""I felt this set up allowed me to tell a bigger story — one about the loss of innocence in the Western world. When I grew up in the 1970s in a commune, everyone was naked and no one was abused. As a boy I could easily sit on a naked man’s lap and no one thought anything of it. Now for very good reasons, the world has become frozen by fear, angst and suspicion. That’s why the film starts off with a bunch of naked men jumping into a lake. It’s about family, togetherness and community. And then, throughout the film, this lake freezes over as the village begins to suspect, fear and persecute.""Outside of the fictious bubble of The Hunt:""False reports of CSA made by children are rare.It is estimated that only 4 to 8% of child sexual abuse reports are fabricated. Most of the fabricated reports are made by adults involved in custody disputes or by adolescents.[...]Only about a third of child sexual abuse incidents/cases are identified, and even fewer are reported.""",0,the-hunt-2012
14804,"While this film acts mainly as the connective tissue between No Greater Love and A Soldier’s Prayer, it nevertheless still offers an immensely emotional, shocking and saddening story, which provides some much needed character development for Kaji. It also helps amplify the impact of the third as well, without it the third installment wouldn’t be nearly as impactful.Despite not being as tightly structured and written as the first, I still fucking loved this so much. There are so many tense moments - particularly the “fire/deserter” sequence as well as the tanks scene that had me on the edge of my seat - and there are others that stunned me with the level of coordination required to pull off such scenes.",8,the-human-condition-ii-road-to-eternity

25299,"Yes, this is maybe as good as it gets. Its biggest achievements surely  are that this is not an empty popculture ballet without significant meaning orbiting around itself in a delirious hedonist fashion but bears, on the one hand, a lot of reference to actual ongoing developments (speak: anxieties) of society (The Zero Church as a religious cult, cf. A Guru is born (Takeshi Kitano), or 1Q84 (Haruki Murakami)) and youth culture (panties-hentais versus punky chicks adoring pure love (cf. later work of Isao Yukisada). On the other hand, it pays huge reference to the girl gang exploitation-genre of the 70's of japanese film history (most obviously by introducing and updating ""Sasori"" from Shun'ya Itô's wonderful series) and thereby puts itself into historical context. Two reasons, why I don't rate the film with 5/5 points: 1. For my taste, there are a little too many upskirt shots. Surely I do understand that we often see those images through the eyes of a subjective camera, mainly the protagonist's fixation for Maria's underparts, and, in addition, it is a means of Sono to confront ourselves, the viewer, with our own ""Blicke des Begehrens"", our own fetishes. But on the other hand, the movie participates in it aswell... and in so far, it is a selling point for itself. A simple means of attraction to cause controversy (yeah, I do remember the huge boner filmed as a close-up shot from underneath in blurry detail). I just do feel a little uneasy about that, I admit. 2. A full 5 point rating is for all-time classics (in my understanding). Maybe, this movie has the potential for that status, time will show.

34826,"How much faith is too much? How much faith is too little? Which faith is the right one? Is it more important to be kind hearted than faithful?From the films I've seen by Dreyer, these are the questions that come up in one way or another. Usually it involves how religious dogma can negatively effect people of faith, as faith and religion don't necessarily coincide, especially with religious zealots that use religion to control people. In both The Passion of Joan of Arc and Days of Wrath, the women have conviction in their faith/beliefs/love, but are crucified for it. It's devastating, but true to life, especially with Joan of Arc. But again it highlighted that faith may not coincide with religion or positive outcomes. Ordet on the other hand, tries to convert you. Miracles do happen, faith is strong enough. Jesus will guide you. I understand why the film and it's ending is beloved, but for me it was quite the opposite. Maybe I'm too much of a non-believer but the ending took me out of it completely, especially considering Dreyer's past work. Instead of another harrowing ending, it's a moment to rejoice, where movie magic and faith coincide. A moment that lets us believe. But I don't.",4,ordet

You somehow managed to rangle up countless spectacular ratings, shot this right up the top 250 list, and suckered me and a bunch of other users into spending 7 whole hours watching a bunch of Hungarian villagers stare at people, walk slowly, get drunk, quietly plot, torture a cat and very little else.There are a collection of gripping scenes in the film, but for every one that compels you to invest your attention there are several that are tedious and ridiculously self-indulgent. Sure, we get it. This is a desolate world these farmers live in. There is stagnation and desperation that will continue to haunt them in a world driven by working yourself to the bone. 7 hours was not even close to necessary to get this point across. I can’t even really call this well acted either unless your definition of great acting is how long someone can hold the same facial expression for.A director like Stanley Kubrick must look like Michael Bay in the eyes of Béla Tarr. I can’t comprehend why anyone would think stretching out somber long sequences by this much somehow adds value to them.

47222,"👍70%“Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.”This one didn’t hit as much as I wanted it to, it’s definitely still a very well directed and well written film as with all of Kubrick’s films, but the comedy and story really didn’t engage with me as much as I expected to. I enjoyed it a lot and the story was definitely intriguing, it’s very much a satirical take on the Cold War and some moments made me laugh, especially when Dr. Strangelove was on screen and the few moments he was on screen he just made me laugh so much with how absurd his character was. The comedy for the most part was pretty hit or miss and I kind of expected to laugh a lot during this, but it was not happening that much and I’m kinda disappointed because I see everyone say this is one of the greatest films of all time but it ended up not being as good as I expected it to be and I can definitely see why many love this one though. The script was very well written and it’s nice to see that they also got the original author of the book to also co-write as well. The performances on the other hand are just phenomenal and everyone kills it here. Peter Sellars is phenomenal in this film and how he plays these three characters is just nothing short of incredible and he deserved all the praise and recognition he got for this, but Dr. Strangelove was just something else and he really stole the show out of the three characters he played despite the short screentime. Sterling Hayden & George C. Scott also had great performances as well as the rest of the cast. Stanley Kubrick once again shows why he’s one of the greatest filmmakers out there and even though this one is my least favourite of his I’ve seen so far, it’s a good film that has some nice moments and the comedy was extremely well written. The pacing was also pretty decent and the runtime of 90 minutes felt just right. Overall, Dr. Strangelove is a good film that I didn’t really love, but I definitely see why many consider it a masterpiece and it has some nice moments, the performances are excellent and honestly I would still highly recommend checking this one out if you’re a fan of Kubrick or satirical comedy!",6,dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb
5687,"This film came out way back in 1995 (the year I was born actually) and it's in a whole other language taking place in a whole other country...and yet it still feels so relevant as if it hasn't even aged a day. The raw intensity, wit, and sheer realism behind everything from the writing to the acting has already made this a new favorite of mine.Everything about this is just great and I just love every inch and bit of it. The direction is excellent with some awesome shots. The film is beautifully lit in black and white (much like the lines of right and wrong) and perfectly sets the grittiness for the film along with the genius writing with heightened realism in the situations, dialogue, actions, and especially characters. The characters are kinda dickish (they're likable assholes), but they're relatable. The way they're portrayed and written is just so honest you'd swear you knew some of these guys. You might even swear that you were one of these guys. There was something I think I noticed about the three lead friends in this that may coincide with the film's themes(correct me if I'm reading to deep into nothing)...the three friends are pretty different; one black, one white, and one brown. The film is pretty much saying that no matter what color of your skin or religion you are, we're all in this fucked world together and we're connected by the same thing...HATE.I LOVE HATE and I can't wait to see HATE again. I'm tempted to rush out and just buy a copy.

88360,"let's do things a little different, eh? for all the praise the animation gets, there's surprisingly little investigation into what it's in service of. animation doesn't exist in a vacuum and the dazzling spectacle it can wrap you in doesn't have value-neutral meaning. the emotional currents the waves of brightly coloured, swift and fluid animation ride on aren't all they're cracked up to be under scrunity. here are a few reasons why.for a film about a multiverse, it contains surprisingly many one-dimensionalities. most participants are caricatures defined by a single trait, most likely tied to a joke or two that's gonna get used way past the point of its comedic well running dry. this creates a world that feels a far cry from lived-in: it's cobbled together, insecure in a sense where elements come across as afterthoughts, or downright undercooked. most apparent when it enters the headquarters of rick--spideys. where the references to the mcu, live-action inserts and product placements take out any stakes and tension - robbing the film of any sense of danger or urgency. this is where it becomes clear this is a corporate product, a theme park ride, a stop & set-up for the next product with no interest in resolution.  it's frustrating how much it spins its wheels and artifically 'adds' to its universe through exposition & corporate referential fingerpointing. if only this was its biggest issue.much worse is how it establishes the multiverse rules & so-called canon events, which completely shatter any semblance of belief in the vastness and possibilities of the world the animation is so eager to show us. everything is pre-determined and the cycle of suffering must continue according to the rules laid out. death is imminent and there's no hope for change, only subjugation to an endless cycle of misery. this in and of itself wouldn't be such a mark against the film if so many other key pieces weren't so congruent with it. we find out peter b. parker & gwen (!) learned about this and decided to join their cause, believing it wholesale and betraying miles -- completely abandoning the characterization & camarderie set up in the previous film. it shatters the emotional currents we've been strung along until this point. it's mindboggling to see them aiding, or rather being a part of, the multiverse fascist troupe catching miles to imprison & stop him from preventing his dad's pre-determined death event. and at last but not least, this segment establishes miles as an anomaly. an idea the sequel could push back on and dispel, but for now sits terribly in the belly of this film.last but not least, and this is the biggest issue i have with this film, we have the familial relationships and the tensions within them. for as amazing as the first 30 minutes look, they end on a note establishing friction between gwen & her father that's caused by him thinking she killed her best friend, with him being a cop ready to arrest. even after she reveals her secret identity to him, he still believes it was her and it's what causes an even greater rift between them than there already was. as much as the beginning prioritizes gwen, she gets shoved to the sides amidst the multiverse & miles' focus, but when we get back to another daughter/father moment, we really get to see how truly misguided the portrayal of this power dynamic is. here we have a teenager who is blamed by her cop father for killing her best friend. he's not only ignoring the grief and loss she's suffered ever since that day by making himself out to be the one who's affected by it most. this conflict is additionally exacerbated by his position as a cop who is trying to 'bring bad people to justice', viewing his own daughter as a criminal. all of this weight rests on her shoulders, and the film puts the onus on her. clearly demarcated by the scene where she comes back home and they talk, with her being sorrowful and trying to make her father understand by telling him she was 'just trying to be a hero like him': identifying her aspirations as spidergwen to be a cop, and apologizing to her father who has effectively shunned her and was on the verge of arresting her for something she didn't do (as cops tend do. weird, huh?). this conflict and its resolution feels pointedly written from the father's perspective with the child having to take the big steps to own up for something they didn't do, only to comfort their parent who is holding all the power and authority in this dynamic. it's something i've noticed as a recurring thread in how familial tensions between parents and children are resolved in american mainstream film. the added dimension of the copaganda this conflict is embedded with makes it even more tiresome. children don't have to make the first steps to make up with their parents, much less so with parents who have hurt and wronged them, ignored their healing process or dismissed their genuine pain being a thing as is the case here. it shows a profound misunderstanding, and/or ignorance, of the power dynamics at play. where the sympathies for them should lie between a parent and a child. gwen does not owe her father a single fucking thing. she was in a very vulnerable situation after a lot of emotional abuse and denial of processing grief in a healthy way, and to have the resolution for the conflict to be her admitting fault where there is none, makes me sick. fuck this!",1,spider-man-across-the-spider-verse

80901,"Alexander Payne si é sempre dedicato a rappresentare (con taglio dolce o grottesco) gli esclusi, individui che si sono ritrovati ad essere disadattati per colpa delle loro scelte o per colpa del destino stesso. E il fato, la forza motrice nei miti greci che il severo e burbero professor Hunham di Paul Giamatti insegna (pura creazione letteraria e poetica come rimarcherà in seguito), unisce le esistenze di questo docente solitario, di una cuoca di colore e di un ragazzo indisciplinato e brillante costretto a rimanere in collegio (l’ambiente scolastico era la location per “Election”, altro film sul confronto tra vecchia e nuova generazione) poiché impossibilitato (o quasi) ad avere la possibilità di trascorrere altrove con qualcuno le vacanze di Natale.Ognuno di loro affronta una perdita o una mancanza di qualche tipo; per la cuoca Mary é il figlio morto in Vietnam, per il giovane Angus é la lontananza dal padre e dalla madre a renderlo sofferente mentre per il professor Hunham é proprio l’assenza di una vita piena e movimentata, messa da parte per una vita scialba, ordinaria e senza distrazioni. Essi sono coloro che sono stati messi da parte, gli esclusi del titolo. Inoltre, il film abbonda di altri oggetti messi da parte, come ad esempio cibo avanzato dalla mensa, reperti antichi in un museo (allusioni a un passato che continua a influenzare il presente) e un albero di Natale sbilenco tra i più brutti rimasti sul mercato. I personaggi sembrano le più improbabili statuette poste in quel grande diorama che é il collegio stesso.Il film ha un gusto pienamente retró e ordinario (lo stile ricorda da vicino quello delle commedie o “feel good movies” dei decenni passati). Payne vuole farci avvertire peró una sensazione di ribellione lungo la sua durata; non é un caso che Angus e Hunham vadano a vedere “Piccolo Grande Uomo”, western revisionista di un regista ribelle come Arthur Penn. Infatti questa é la storia di una “revisione” sulla propria vita, su un cambiamento che coinvolge un uomo maturo, influenzato dalle persone che lo circondano (questo film é quasi un “Attimo Fuggente” che interessa sia l’allievo che il maestro). La frase di Democrito “Mentre la storia é cambiamento, la vita stessa é percezione” é più rilevante che mai (ognuno di noi la vede come vuole, decide di abbracciarla o di rinunciarci del tutto, ma vale sempre la pena di viverla, anche nelle piccole cose. Alla fine siamo noi a crearci il proprio destino).——————Alexander Payne has always dedicated himself to representing (with a sweet or grotesque edge) the excluded, individuals who have found themselves to be misfits through the fault of their choices or through the fault of destiny itself. And fate, the driving force in the Greek myths that Paul Giamatti's severe and gruff Professor Hunham teaches (pure literary and poetic creation as he will later point out), unites the existences of this solitary teacher, of a black cook and of a boy undisciplined and brilliant forced to stay in boarding school (the school environment was the location for ""Election"", another film about the confrontation between the old and new generations) because he was unable (or almost) to have the opportunity to spend the Christmas holidays with someone else.Each of them faces a loss or lack of some kind; for the cook Mary it is her son who died in Vietnam, for the young Angus it is the distance from his father and mother that makes him suffer while for Professor Hunham it is precisely the absence of a full and eventful life, set aside for a dull life , ordinary and without distractions. They are those who have been set aside, the holdovers of the title. Furthermore, the film is full of other discarded objects, such as leftover food from the canteen, ancient artifacts inside a museum (references to a past that continues to live and influence the present) and one of the ugliest crooked Christmas trees left on the market. The characters seem like the most unlikely statuettes placed in that large diorama that is the college itself.The film has a completely retro and ordinary feel (the style closely resembles that of the comedies or ""feel good movies"" of past decades). However, Payne wants us to feel a feeling of rebellion throughout its duration; it is no coincidence that Angus and Hunham go to see “Little Big Man”, a revisionist western by a rebel director like Arthur Penn. In fact, this is the story of a ""revision"" of one's life, of a change that involves a mature man, influenced by the people around him (this film is almost a ""Dead Poets Society"" that interests both the student and the teacher). Democritus' phrase ""While history is change, life itself is perception"" is more relevant than ever (each of us sees it as we want, decides to embrace it or give it up completely, but it is always worth living it, even in the small things. in the end we create our own destiny).",6,the-holdovers
43077,"Having my first watch of this be in the cinema was absolutely incredible. Such a touching film, and it was set up so well by an absolutely incredible live introduction. I go into films and make up my own mind about what ideas they spawn in my head, so it was awesome that I pretty much agreed with everything that was said about the film’s relevance as I was watching the film. I think my main takeaway was how brilliant it is at managing to craft a message through the mere existence of the film. As an audience, you have to benefit of reflecting on and taking the constructives out of the main character’s situation. He struggles in a way many people do, and it’s not just limited to joblessness, it can essentially be a stand-in for any time of depression for any audience member. And the film constantly puts him in situations that force him to act out in the same way as the thief he feels oppressed by. A cyclical situation that calls for him to step on people who he doesn’t realise are in the same situation as him. The film achieves this incredible feeling of unity, a sense of connection I’m pretty sure we all know is there but it’s sometimes hard to truly feel flowing us. And sometimes it takes something as simple as a film to truly allow us to open ourselves to that idea again and feel that connectivity. I was actually thinking on the bus ride to the cinema about how films make me feel like I have a better understanding of other people, at the time unaware of the themes the film was about to explore, or even the wide variety of people in the packed cinema, all connected by a desire to watch movies and connect with others through them.

54733,"It's that kind of tedious melodrama, the kind that you knew had won an Oscar before you read that it had won an Oscar. One's understanding of contemporary German romance is going to be skewed to hell with only two major exports for reference, Wings of Desire and this, in which our heroes are cogs in a bureacratic machine who gain new life by becoming degenerate, infatuated stalkers. It's neither romantic nor heroic, in spite of what their contrived conclusions are striving to imply. Still, The Lives of Others has the virtue of depicting civilization in statolatry. Neighbors, families, and lovers are their own potential informants, alienated in the name of community, desperate to maintain favor with the Party which has inevitably been stocked with connivers and abusers, and connivers and abusers only. Spying on a playwright's literary rebellion is not the plot to draw from this world, though: writing manuscripts and monitoring bugs may be the least cinematic subjects possible. Instead, the best scenes are those few with socialism's overseers, basic examples of power's eternal corruption; the scheming of one lecherous boss is only a repetition of King David's great sin some millennia earlier.

27042,"Ingmar Bergman was married 5 times and had 4 divorces. Let´s just say, he was familiar with the topic.I watched the theatrical version first, so that I can discover something new, when I later watch the miniseries (rather than missing something, if I would do it the other way around).“Scenes from a Marriage” is one of Bergman´s most acclaimed works and deservedly so. Apart from his trademark intimate close-ups, there aren´t many visual flourishes here, as they would just distract from the important aspects. All Bergman needs for this timeless masterpiece are two world-class actors, Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson, and one of the best screenplays of all time. It´s amazing how two people talking which each other for almost 3 hours can be so enthralling and hypnotizing that I was never bored for even a moment. We witness the deterioration of a marriage, as two lovers slowly but surely grow apart, and this is as raw, painful, and brutally honest as it gets. This whole process is portrayed with patience and subtlety and without judgment (though the husband comes across worse than the wife, to be honest). Ullmann and Josephson are fully committed and carry the film with nuanced and emotive performances, playing fully realized and authentic characters. The dialogue is poetic, layered, and resonating, and the film features several emotionally hard-hitting standout scenes. Once again, Bergman proves to be a superb observer of human behavior as well as an insightful philosopher on human nature. It´s clear to see how “Scenes from a Marriage” influenced filmmakers such as Woody Allen, Richard Linklater, or Noah Baumbach, and its relevance can still be felt. Society and the institution of marriage might have changed during the last decades, yet I´m sure, not being married myself, that the film still hits close to home for many people.",8,scenes-from-a-marriage

The day finally came today, where I had no plans and woke up early and well rested with my mind set on experiencing it.If you haven’t already guessed it based on my rating, I can tell you that I didn’t enjoy the movie that much, which also makes it obvious that I have no desire to ever watch it again, since it requires you to devote so much time, but also patience to it.I think it had a good story and I really enjoyed the first hour of it, but around the 3 hour mark I started to think it already was twice as long as it needed to be and I wasn’t even halfway through it. I went in with an open mind and with a lot of patience, but I just don’t think the movie (or any other movie for that matter) warrants a more than 7 hour runtime. The pacing was terrible and we got long shots of nothing, while every scene got repetitive and I was surprised when a scene lasted less than 10 minutes, but I am still happy to have experienced it, maybe with the exception of the long scene of animal abuse towards the cat. The movie has plenty of redeeming qualities too, which also is evident by all the great reviews, but after the first hour it started to grow tiresome for me and I think it would have worked much better with a more traditional runtime. It is very well directed and there are a lot of amazing shots that look beautiful, while it captures a nice sense of hopelessness in the characters, but it failed to make me care about them and it felt like a slog to get through most scenes. The visuals are strong and there are some good themes and messages, but it is not very engaging and it makes the story hard to follow at times, while making the overall experience an exhaustive drag to get through.",2,satantango

70844,"”Why must I realize how wretched I am? Why must I suffer so hellishly for my insignificance?”Winter Light is more like a play and less like a conventional film, it features only a few characters and instead of being reliant on events it is a dialogue dependent film. Like the first part of the trilogy it deals with concepts of love, faith, suffering and doubt, this time it is a priest who is struggling to find the meaning of his life. Thematically Winter Light starts where Through A Glass Darkly ends, here Bergman is giving an explanation about what David was saying in the final scene of Through A Glass Darkly, that love is the only proof for God’s existence. Tomas is a man who has lost his wife and since then he has been doubtful about God and his powers, and his inability to love another human being (Marta) resonances his inability to have faith in God, it is like Bergman is saying that one can believe in God (thus suffer less) only if he/she can love another human being. And then we have Marta, who is in love with Tomas, she is calling him, she is begging him for his love but there is no answer, for her this love is equal to suffering. Isn't this reminiscent of the relationship between man and God?, this concept is very similar to what Bergman was trying to say in his other masterpiece The Seventh Seal, in that film people were calling for God passionately but no answer was coming no matter how loud they were calling, then one can assume that faith/love is a torment, believing in God’s existence is not possible without suffering, then why one must believe in God if it is all pain and agony that awaits him/her?  Winter Light may lack the power of some of Bergman’s other works but it is still a strong and moving spiritual experience.",6,winter-light
29735,"No subject is off limits for comedy, even the Holocaust; yet it's hard to call writer-director-star Roberto Benigni's sub-Three Stooges combination of bumbling, mugging and gurning comedy. Ethical considerations aside about using a historical atrocity as a backdrop to tell a whimsical story of the wonderful power of denial (or, as the film would have it, love - such excessive sentimentality invites a cynical response), La vita è bella bizarrely structures its dramatic beats identically to its comic ones, with the result that there's nothing really to any of it beyond superficialities - no comedy, no stakes, no drama. Guido will lower the anvil he's carrying, panting, saying he wants to quit, to which the person in line behind him says he'll be killed; Guido makes an exaggerated, exasperated face and picks up his anvil again. Or his son will say he doesn't want to have a shower and his father will order him to take one, and they argue back and forth, neither of them aware that the elderly and children in the camp are being gassed to death in the showers. I find it borderline incomprehensible. (One of the few redeeming aspects to the film is its cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli, which for me evoked the warmth and lighting styles of Italian cinema of the '60s and '70s, although to what end I wasn't sure.) What is the message of this film ultimately? That innocence should be preserved at all costs? While this might not be Benigni's intention, it's this implication in connection with the Holocaust, rather than the comedy per se, that has the most potential to offend.",2,life-is-beautiful

Half of it looks like it was filmed in a forest in someone's backyard. The green sand thing was interesting for a minute and I did like the brown and grey filters at the beginning. It raises some thought-provoking philosophical questions, the acting is good, some interesting camerawork and the sound design is great. My biggest take away from it is it's too damn long by at least 1h and it's one of the most painfully slow and boring movies i've ever watched.

63209,"I was so incredibly impressed by this film, how technically skilled it is, how innovative it is for it’s time in terms of the story and film-making. Like obviously it’s a classic that I’ve seen crop up all the time and it’s like you know one of the ones to watch, but I didn’t expect it to be this good. You can tell the visual effects were revolutionary and therefore it commands respect. More emotion and meaning seeped from the the shots and frames within this film than most movies ever made— that speaks a lot of volume. Cinema may have expanded and developed massively over time, but the emotion behind it has stayed the same and it’ll never really change.Specifically looking at the nature of the cinematography and it’s impact, there’s a great contrast with light and dark colours: good at showing the two sides of humanity that the film is trying to convey. Every shot and emotion the actors communicate are entirely expressive making them completely entrancing and almost hypnotising, it’s just so damn impressive for a film to hold that much masterful power for its time. I really liked the combination of industrialism and robot aspects: it was visually effective as well as allowing for the communication the whole idea of the fall of humanity under a higher power. So this was banned for being too Marxist because you know Nazis (cue Leo torching a bunch of Nazis as Rick Dalton) and you can definitely see those elements to. Political assertions aside I think those aspects elevate this film to much more open-minded ideas but I won’t get into that any further.  Yeah fuck fascism! So to conclude, if you haven’t watched this technical masterpiece and mandatory film buff classic I highly recommend you do as it’s genuinely so interesting and engaging, a real good experience for sure.

86883,"Wenders has always been a filmmaker deeply concerned with emotions, what explains his fascination for directors such as Nicholas Ray, Allan Dwan and Yasujiro Ozu, the latter being feebly referenced in this latest effort (even if it is probably closer in intentions to Kurosawa's 'Ikiru'), in a homage not devoided of a good dose of misguided exoticism and orientalism. In Wenders' work in particular, this sentimental domain in the idea of an affecting cinema usually comes within a suspiciously alienated package, frequently being stated without nothing to support it, and in this film it achieves an ignorance of its own intentions that is quite baffling. It's extremely corny and I have the conviction that any person that was touched by the film would never be able to find beauty in a life even remotely ressembling its protagonist's, but beyond that I mostly have a big problem with how the film stages Yakusho's actions, giving emphasis to every easy idea it can take its hands on in a manner that is so phony and silly. I didn't find this as offensive as some, but just very patronizing and embarassingly empty, its soundtrack composed of the safest greatest hits selection from a handful of 20th century artists matching the very silly ideas it disposes of to prove its point (arbitrary analogic nostalgia, idiotic statements such as ""now is now, later is later"" or ""Patricia Highsmith made me realize fear and anxiety are different things"", that awful encounter with a dying man near the end, the silently ritualistic interactions with random people, the very alienated and completely idiotic depiction of disabled and homeless people, the atrociously reductionist final sequence...).Incidentally this is an intriguing portrait of Tokyo's diverse and artful public toilets, and on a side note, I would recommend Jarmusch's 'Paterson' for those who found interest in this film - far from a great one, but a valid effort that arrives at a similar conclusion to this one by a less embarassing strategy.",2,perfect-days-2023

60507,"☆""Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money, and for a woman. I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman. Funny, isn't it?""☆This is my 5,000th film. Thank you for helping me choose it, friends.(It's also my 1,888th film review. But who's counting?)Billy Wilder's classic film noir, the crime thriller that turned 75 last year, Double Indemnity remained until today one of the most glaring omissions in my list of watched movies, one of those ""how did you miss this?"" pictures. But never has an insurance salesman been so interesting. Never has a housewife been so seductive. Never has a claims adjuster been so… well, no, claims adjusters are always shysters.The film noir that effectively established the genre and made it an accessible one to audiences, that took a seedy story and gave it the combination of gritty and flashy, that made a cast of troublemakers and broken people all worth watching, and that helped usher in the age of failed fellas in fedoras and the femmes fatales who filet them. The movie that gave us Raymond Chandler as a screenwriter, Billy Wilder's first Oscar nomination for Best Director, venetian blinds lighting before it was cliché, and veiled shots at the Production Code which Wilder would shatter within a decade. And smoking. Lots and lots of smoking.It's 1938, and Los Angeles insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) stumbles into his office at night wounded by a gunshot, soon dictating a confession for friend and claims manager Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). From this moment, we learn of the story in flashback.During a housecall for her husband in Glendale, Neff meets the gorgeous housewife Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) and they chat and flirt until the awkward moment when Phyllis inquires about a life insurance plan on her spouse, but without his knowing about it. Neff is no dummy and knows what this means: she's planning murder, and after at first feeling repulsed after a time hearing about the drunken abuse he wants in, with his tricky explanation of the ""double indemnity"" clause whereby the payout is twice. But he's also fallen into her spell, and the $50,000 is just a convenient way to stay close to this temptress. Indeed, the pair kill Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) as Neff hides in the back seat of a car and breaks his neck, then poses as the man on a train as he and Phyllis dispose of the body on the tracks. As the insurance investigates, adjuster Keyes is skeptical of the suicide which is suggested, and refuses to allow a payment as he accuses Phyllis of murder with an unknown accomplice. He tells this all to his friend Walter Neff! Not only is Keyes suspicious, so is the deceased's daughter Lola (Jean Heather), and soon a twisted game of clever backstabbing, shadowy motives, and shifty double-crosses commences.My favorite thing about the very best noirs -- The Big Sleep, The Maltese Falcon, at least American ones of this era -- is the cadence of the dialogue, the pace of conversations that snap back and forth, the rhythm of emotions and double entendres spinning right into deadly misgivings. Here it's crafted by Wilder and Chandler from James M. Cain's similarly titled novella, the first Hollywood screenplay from the brilliant crime novelist but nearly the fortieth by Wilder in his fourth directorial effort. And indeed it's an untouchable script, full of cynicism and provocation which would be key themes in nearly all Wilder's films for the rest of his career, even the comedies and lighter fare. But here it's dark as midnight, like the shadows and shades of John Seitz's black-and-white cinematography. Practically inventing the noir techniques of using the point-of-view of the criminal (or, one of them), boiling sexual tension and dooming vice, and as film scholar Robert Sklar wrote a ""dark and claustrophobic framing, with key lighting from sources within the mise-en-scène casting strong shadows that both conceal and project characters' feelings."" That point-of-view is a narrator, MacMurray himself as Neff, not a dead man like the narrator in Sunset Boulevard but a doomed one. And though the film had a lengthy script for less than two hours, it's never talky but consistently arresting and urgent, barreling from one tension-filled moment to another. The dangerous flirtation, the murder plot, the suspicion of Keyes, all heightened by the rousing crescendos of Miklós Rózsa's Academy Award-nominated score.And though this is a deadly noir, something in me sympathized with Mr. Neff, a man who is in so deep and digging further down that he doesn't know that the only way not to be buried further is to stop digging. I've been there -- ha, no, not murder -- in the sense of feeling caught in lies and deception that only cascade into tragedy, all from your own stupid mistakes and greed. It's exhausting and impossible. And hearing his confession sporadically in Double Indemnity only builds the tension as you decide to empathize with this fallen man or not. ""It's straight down the line for both of us,"" Walter remembers. So do I. This Wilder guy is something else huh. Hot damn. Thank you all for picking this one.

Is it the same for everybody?

And I am glad I held off inorder to try and take it in fully, rather than powering through it.(Quick Hits) ... Spoilers- Some interesting notes about Autumn Sonata include that it was the only collaboration by Ingrid Bergman and Ingmar Bergman (no relation). Also it was the last of Ingmar Bergman's works to be made for theatrical exhibition- The film explores the sad history between an estranged daughter and mother, when the mother Charlotte comes to visit Eva for the first time in seven years- It is clever how the film is bookened by describing just how strong a person Eva is by her husband who is a pastor, which works as a curious setup for understanding the hardships she has gone through. Then later it mournfully rounds out her character, who we find out feels trapped rather than fulfilled by life     ""Chopin was emotional, but not mawkish. Feeling is very far from sentimentality, The prelude tells of pain, not reverie. It hurts, but he doesn't show it.""- We find out how talented Eva is as an author and caregiver, which unfortunately pails in comparison to her mother's accomplishment of becoming a famous pianist   - Eva can play well enough, but her mother is sure to step in behind her to show off her interoperation of the material after asking Eva to play first- I always find it astonishing how weathered the very lovely Liv Ullmann is made to look in these heavy films- An early moment of heartbreak comes when Charlotte learns that Eva has taken over care of her disabled and paralyzed sister Helena. Charlotte does embrace Helena, but must come to terms that her condition will only get worse- The most compelling part for me came when Eva becomes very cold to her mother, and lays out the bleak reality of the hardships she put her through toward the end- We find out that Eva had to comfort her father due to his wife's infidelity. I recall it being mentioned that Charlotte's absence played a part in helena's condition. Finally Eva describes how she felt like such an awkward child, which was only met with judgement by her famous mother- It is so sad to her Eva describe her life as being trapped in hell. Along with her saying her husband is her best friend, but she is unable to love him since that all got drained from her as a result of being left to deal with the mess left by her mother   - Needless to say this harsh look back at the reality of what Eva and Charlotte's relationship had become, was enough for Charlotte to leave the following day. But Autumn Sonata has this brillant ambiguous ending where Eva shows her husband a reconciliation letter she has written for her mom, but the film ends without us knowing if Charlotte ever reads it- I typically expect to see much more style from an Ingmar Bergman film, but this one was slightly more stripped down. There are some great shots especially during that fierce hear to heart we get between the mother and daughter, along with some flash backsWhile I was mostly taken by this mother and daughter's story, I now can't help but relate this to my own relationship with my kids. I think about all the regret I have from being too hard on them at times when they are being wild. And I just hope their lasting memories are of the good things I have done, rather than those moments of weakness when I do become an asshole.Crazy to think that I am now up to 10 Bergman films, which only scratches the surface on his entire body of work. This one definitely reminded me the most of 'Cries and Whispers', which I would be curious to return to.      Thanks for reading!Happy movie watching ... Skål! 🍻",7,autumn-sonata

15680,"This just proves that the Letterboxd average ratings are just absolutely ridiculousA gripping heartfelt thriller I heard someone say? Are u taking the fuckin piss?Such an inconsistent movie that struggles to find its footing almost the entire film.I will start of by saying that the first half of this movie was actually decent to an extent. I was kind of intrigued to see where this story would take me, but once again it goes fucking nowhere. I thought the flashbacks with Nawal (the mother) which did take up a large portion of the first half, was genuinely really good. I thought the bus sequence was absolutely great, it was shot very well. Very real acting and raw emotion displayed throughout that terrifying sequence. But apart from that, this film had nothing else special to offer.The premise and the set designs of this movie aren’t that pleasing, and yes I know it’s not supposed to be, but you want it to at least look somewhat intriguing. Like your in the film yourself. This movie fails to do that.The brother was extremely underutilised throughout this entire film, he was only brought it to serve a major part, in the last 30 minutes of the film. The scenes of the daughter (Jeanne) sometimes was pretty interesting, when she is visiting the places her mother was once at. But everything else involving her was just straight up boring and fucking long. This film has a stupidly long runtime as well, there is a lot of scenes in this film that just didn’t need to be filmed. Because they served nothing to the story in the slightest bit, and was hard to focus on, because it is filled with dull, uninteresting dialogue that just couldn’t grasp my attention at all. I also had a problem with the first 30 minutes. I thought they skipped back and forward with the flashbacks way too much, to the point where it was hard to figure out who was who. Because we didn’t have much insight on the characters as it was the start of the movie. I did end up figuring it out after a while, but it was hard to focus on, because you don’t know many of the characters names, and the mum and the daughter look the fuckin same!!! And that plot twist? I will admit, the plot twist isn’t bad. But it didn’t take me by surprise. I knew it was happening as soon as that pool scene happened. Didn’t impact me at all, and that’s what the entire film was building up too.I didn’t think this movie was powerful like everybody was telling me it was. Yes I get the realism of it, but the story itself wasn’t impactful enough for me to appreciate everything that was getting shown. But man, that second half was just fuckin boring. I do want to say more but I genuinely just cannot be arsed to talk about this boring film. I just want to say, that I did want to love this. I really did, but once again.

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a true rollercoaster and not for the weak hearted.Seeing Jim Carrey in a genuinely serious role was a massively refreshing experience, it’s sad we don’t see it more as he really plays his part well and gives off a performance that will really captivate the viewer with his raw emotions on display and his relatable character work. The only reason I haven’t give this a higher rating despite my final feelings is because I went into this expecting something entirely different, throwing me off course a little bit, and that Is probably my own fault. This isn’t to takeaway from what I and many of you experienced, as everything that has been said about this film from an emotional stand point really does stick.

54350,"Pretty ambitious for Theo Angelopoulos to kickstart an epic trilogy at the age of 70. Time was running out on the metaphorical parking meter and he decided to start a 10,000-piece jigsaw puzzle.Angelopoulos is practically the national filmmaker of Greece, and The Weeping Meadow is a strong representative of his style - a story of a select few individuals set against epic scale, whose suffering in various wet, gray landscapes serves as a reflection of the larger experiences of the Greek people, who presumably also suffered in wet, gray landscapes. As the first part of a trilogy that was left uncompleted due to the director's death, The Weeping Meadow showcases many of the finest features of Angelopoulos as a practical filmmaker, with his talent for composing landscape shots and preference for long takes, but there doesn't seem to be much here that wasn't explored in greater depth or with more cutting themes that wasn't in his masterpiece The Traveling Players, released nearly 30 years prior; the musical identity in particular echoes similar ideas about the value of cultural expression. While his work is expected to convey a certain degree of discomfort thanks to his characters' misery, it doesn't help that The Weeping Meadow has a plot that's less immediately palatable than many of Angelopoulos's other films - an elderly man attempting to pressure his adopted daughter into marriage (with him) after raising her from childhood; this isn't a Woody Allen film, after all. An ambitious attempt to embrace an even wider scale than his previous films, featuring some of the filmmaker's best work visually, but not the best introduction to Angelopoulos given how literal the historical events are depicted. In some ways, the grand scale actually seems to work against the film compared to some of the director's earlier films of a similar design; the technical execution is impressive - plenty of shots of billowing sheets and a silent flotilla of rowboats fleeing a half-submerged village - but sometimes it feels like it comes at the expense of intimacy. The omnipresent suffering might be a bit too much, even though it's the director's style - constantly pressing the sorrow button eventually just makes people feel numb.The Letterboxd Top 250: #247/250",7,the-weeping-meadow

87021,"78 years old Wenders still observing humans living through the motions of time, making his dreamed Ozu film, with few sprinkles of Kurosawa’s Ikiru though maybe feeling more like the Japanese cousin of Jarmusch’s Paterson; finding stars-crossing beauty through contemplating the mundane just by learning how to experience life instead of just facing / looking / registering; yada yada.Maybe feels one of his most meandering at that – which on itself Perfect Days isn’t far removed from his Road trilogy flicks, in both techniques and spirit, and maybe a tad lost in its own cosmetic signature traces that lingers through way too often dead time that might feel padding for thematic noise while trying to evoke the obvious points around: beauty of the mundane everyday, which might just tend to risk at crossing a tad cold in a digitally distant grey coloring of its Tokyo urban environment.Ironically his B&W flicks shot by Robby Müller managed to look FAR more authentically naturalist than here, which is not much of the film’s fault and more of the state of the world of today, where Wenders is trying to pursue and recover some instance of poetic random beauty his camera would naturally register in the past, but the noisy atmosphere, grayish looked and chopped timing of fast-tracking motions that dominate our modern existence of indifference won’t allow it, that’s why all the dreams our main character of Hirayama are shot in traditional black and white and often look to be the most pristine pictures and images of the entire film – much like the photos he takes in his day to day.But when a certain character enters the movie, it helps it take on a whole new freshness that the movie was in need of, and finally lets us absorb the inner core of the live we are put to experience as backseat passengers. Observing senior underrated legend Koji Yakusho as he embodies mister Hirayama and we accompany him in his daily ritualistic routine of public bathroom cleaning, seen by him as a pleasure to be honored, not adhering to the prejudice that others may project on such a profession, living with full integrity, proud and contentment where many would not; finding leisure and fulfillment in ordinary life.Wenders being an unassuming sentimentalist, a palpable sense of sentiment will inevitably comes across in his characters, no matter how a tad beaten down his style might feel by this point. His aspirations and gaze still search for something in the frame, the natural chance of everyday beauty, and his character's gaze here accompanies him in this search for self-satisfaction, which is not cheap or forced sentimentality, as some people think it is, part of a real attempt to face the world with altruism, and the film’s strengths rely in that earnest witnessing belief!We are made to see that in the reflection of people passing by on the street reflecting on the bathroom ceiling there is beauty; in an awkward exchanges glances with a stranger; in Hirayama’s capability of suddenly open a tender smile at the mere anything. The world is written in different worlds and sometimes they cross, like shadows intertwining, each one with its secret and appearance, revealed through the small details present in a face. We are put to see the reflections of these shadows up-close, feel their being and understand that in the ever constant repetition of the everyday, their very uniqueness form the bright perfect spots of tender and sweetness that make each day count and perhaps perfect!I however saw some people arguing against the film (very harshly) in what I can best define as: judging how corny and sentimental the film is – which could’ve been valid arguments; but then accuse it of acting under an altruistic aristocratic vision, which fair enough a bathroom cleaner who reads Faulkner in his free time can be far of a stretch of “realism”. But I can’t help but to feel that it seems that they themselves are starting from a reductionist and prejudiced view, just because they are incapable of seeing the genuineness of feelings, here they then perjure it as pendent or bourgeois lecturing.I don’t see no bad ill nor in the creative process nor in what’s trying to evoke, though I get it might not be everyone’s cut of tea for how to sell altruistic life-affirming drama is a ever point of contingency amidst film criticism. For my money, the level of heart Wenders is evoking here is more than made felt in its small instances of genuine beauty and especially through Yakusho’s sweet believable persona that hypnotizes us with intrigue towards his secret shadow, but makes us feel the hopeful warmth whenever he opens that silly smile.Also, Perfect Days has something of a classic ‘old-fashionedness’ that makes it stand out a feeling of uniqueness. The kind of film that believes in the power of meandering contemplation, of nice songs speaking about the truth of the individual’s emotions, that small things like a smile or a hug can make a life feel wholesome. Sappy?! Probably, but when presented with this level of self-convincingness about its own coolness vibes of positivity, who am I to judge?!P.S: Also, great soundtrack and probably the best use of Nina Simone’s ""Feeling Good"" – reused to complete clichéd saturation, but that’s somehow made work in a final sweet needle drop!",6,perfect-days-2023
49621,"I hate to be a killjoy, but…This is all just meaningless absurdity mixed with pseudo-intellectualism for a generation with ADHD that’s been conditioned by Marvel movies. Since that was pretty scathing, I will say that I really enjoyed this movie when it actually took the time to slow down, breathe, and earn those big emotional moments that it was aiming for, and I will admit that I had the biggest smile on my face both whenever we were in the Wong Kar-wai universe and branching paths would play out in a montage that I think was shot on actual film. (Also, that dog whip gag and sign twirling fight scene were great). And even still, it was hard to take those moments seriously when every time they would happen, the movie would cut away to some gag that it had already repeated an unnecessarily annoying amount of times up until the point that it  retroactively made the first time it made the joke unfunny. Like did we really need to see the hotdog universe that many times? This movie is proclaiming that it’s EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE and all it can think to do is the same hotdog finger joke and Ratatouille parody over and over. If I were to add any more positives, Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan were phenomenal. Anyways, as you probably guessed, I felt that this movie was trying to do way too much. Yes, I know that’s the point, but it just reminded me of the “lol XD rawr im random” style of humor from the Tumblr era that has long since passed. Seriously, it felt like an overlong YouTube sketch in some moments.I have a headache. Really don’t want to give this much more thought, because I feel like what the movie actually wanted me to feel changed a million times within the last 10 minutes alone.

64859,"Finally got through this on my third attempt. On paper it sounds right up my alley - the story of a cremator who is recruited to the Nazi cause, though his wife and kids have Jewish blood. And it is described as both a “horror” movie and a “dark comedy”. But the execution (ha) flew over my head. I know this is an artsy film, not meant to reward a literal interpretation. It would be silly to say, “No one acts like this in real life.” So instead I will say, “I found the endless babble about a merciful god who looks favorably upon cremation as a way to return people to dust irritating, and I found the way everyone smiled and nodded at the obviously deranged ramblings of a lunatic annoying.” I read something about how chilling this film is because it shows the mundanity of evil, and the progression of a mind losing its grip on sanity, but I never saw anything mundane or sane about this man. He could have executed his family in the first 5 minutes of the film and it would have seemed totally within character (also would have saved me an entire hour and a half of listening to him prattle on about how we must do all we can to alleviate suffering, and how death is an end to suffering, and god is merciful and cremation is awesome, blah blah blah.)",2,the-cremator
6590,"While I respect the obvious emotional resonance this has with the overwhelming majority of its audience, I simply cannot make heads or tails of this. To begin with a positive, I do think the framing is very purposeful and impressive. I really believe that Edward Yang is a master filmmaker on a formal level. As for the rest however? It’s my opinion that no one could put his attitude towards this film better than one of his characters themselves: “Let’s wait another half hour.”It is not the (sprawling!) runtime itself that I take issue with, but the glacially slow pace. There wouldn’t be a problem if something substantive was happening that justified making this a film as opposed to a novel, but everything is so understated and ostensibly tranquil that it just comes across as dull. The protagonist never really comes into focus here as his own character. I’m just left flabbergasted at the quasi-potency overall, as what this really boils down to is four hours of monotonous turf wars between gangs of obnoxious teenagers and character drama that entirely fails to invest its audience. If there is a deeper meaning in all of this, I have not succeeded in picking up on it, and I am deeply lost on why a film of such enormous scope (read: unnecessary, frustrating meandering) has so little to share.",3,a-brighter-summer-day

69806,"For his 3rd feature film, Andrei Tarkovsky offered us Solaris, a singular reflection through humanity, identity, memories, death and fear.On the paper, Solaris is very promising, and ambitious. And indeed, the screenplay is just amazing. When they said that there were only Tarkovsky to come up with this script, well that was true.But where Solaris did fail, is to fascinate me, just where Stalker brilliantly succeed almost 3 months ago. I didn’t find back that feeling of exaltation i had in front of Stalker. One of the other major problem I had with this one, is that I never, never get emotionally attached to the main character Kris, maybe it’s because of the poor acting, which is another issue. That’s a shame because, like i said, it was very promising : Kinda contemplative, the film unfortunately felt too long for me, way too long which involved many boring phases. I had a real hard time with the narration. Actually the first hour went very good with me. It’s when he goes to the station that I started to lose a little in interest.

28261,"It didn't send me.McMurphey is a narcissist who disrupts a mental institution until it ends in tragedy. He experiences one grain of character growth in bonding with his fellow patients, but his greatest act of ""kindness"" is telling his sex worker girlfriend to sleep with a mentally ill young man who I would argue is not emotionally mature enough to consent. But what bothers me the most is the boy's club aura of this film, the way McMurphey affords instant camaraderie to white men (and Chief, the token silent but secretly wise Indigenous character), while treating women and Black men based on how accommodating they are to him. And if they don't accommodate him, they are the oppressors and he is the oppressed.Ratched may a narcissist in her own right, addicted to the power she holds over her patients, but I believe she thinks she's doing what must be done and not that she's the greatest villain in film history or whatever she's supposed to be. Fifties/sixties mental health practices were draconian, to be sure, but our society also loathes women in power who won't capitulate to men's desires. That's the reason she is considered evil, in my opinion, moreso than her medical orders.Anyway, I'm ready for Ryan Murphy to make her a hot gay angel of death and for the ""white men are oppressed"" narrative to be over. 💉💉💉",4,one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest

The perfect choice for my 250th logged movie.I bought this Criterion like two months ago but I’ve been waiting until the right opportunity to watch it in the right frame of mind and I am so glad that I did. Mesmerising cinematography, incredible performances and thought-provoking philosophical dialogue, this movie is a work of art, simple as that. I may upon subsequent rewatches attempt to dissect the themes and meanings behind Stalker in a review, but for now I am simply in awe and could never even begin to unpack the thematic weight and depth to it. My first Tarkovsky though and I absolutely cannot wait to explore his other works!I told myself in January this year that I would try to watch 120 movies throughout 2020 that I had never seen before (150 seemed a little unrealistic) and that I would use Letterboxd to keep track of them all.

78027,"Absolutely brilliant.I could try to dissect the infinitely important subject matter Christian Mungiu took on with 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days. But to tell such a harrowing story about a horrible situation in a truly terrifying context, by reconstructing the tones, frameworks, and visual cues of thrillers and horror films as a raw, minimalistic, social-realist drama? Hands down one of the best and most creative cinematic choices I've recently come across. I feel like few pieces of media approach the reality of women's hardships and suffering for the truly nightmarish situations they are, as many stories of women being wronged by either individual men or society at large have often grounded their narratives and characters in a sort of clean, normalized realism which can lose the power to actually be provocative enough to make viewers think. Or, they go full exploitation film and treat stories of reprehensible deeds like weird, pseudo-feminist male fantasies, which this movie thankfully avoids.But Christian Mungiu's tale of civil rights, sexual culture, and female friendship is no ordinary film about trying to get an abortion. It's a movie that wants to confront the viewer with the truth of how scary it is to be a woman needing something from a world that only wants to control women, in every sense of the word. And that's really what 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days is about: control - the control of people as individuals, the control of bodies as objects, the control of choices as insignificant constructs.Of course, this film's focus is within the very specific context of late-era Communist Romania, but everything about it is rooted in the very real, relatable fears women experienced in that time and place, fears women are still experiencing today across the globe. So, for a drama like this dealing with fear, confusion, anger, and worry, I think the stylistic approach of crafting this as a veiled, blood-boiling genre film is not only creatively perfect, but utterly effective in enforcing and presenting the movie's themes and ideas.I'll say it again. Absolutely brilliant.",9,4-months-3-weeks-and-2-days

10670,"First time I heard about this film was in the summer of 2016. I was listening to different cinema related podcasts, one about science fiction films, one about anticipated films and one about the top 25 best thrillers ever made. Then, one of them was asked what film they included in their list, but he didn't think would make the list. He mentioned Woman in the Dunes, and told a little about him watching it as a student and was transfixed by it. I paused the podcast, watchlisted Woman in the Dunes, which only a few of my LB friends had watched, and since then, I have been looking for this film on legal and illegal streaming sites, and then, yesterday while watching the brilliant Vampyr on Youtube, Woman in the Dunes was on the autoplay thing. I had been looking for that film on putlocker.is, gomovies, 123movies, fmovies in a year and a half, and then an english subtitled HD version had been lying on Youtube that whole time... and of course was the film absolutely fantastic.Already from the start, we know it's a thriller with the eerie shots of bugs being collected by Niki Jumpei, our protagonist. One of the best directed moments of this film and in Japanese film history is, when he finds out the villagers trapped him, and the film only gets better from there on. The atmosphere makes us thirsty, and the story is highly captivating, and fascinating. We are fascinated by the character development, the decisions which are being taken by everyone involved in this film and the erotic elements. It's a fifty-three years old film and has nudity such as bare buttocks, breasts, profanity and something else I won't give away here.The tension is unbelieveable high from the first shot with the mesmerizing score to the last. The direction of Hiroshi Teshigahara is stunning, almost the highlight of the film actually. He was the first Japanese director to be nominated for an Oscar, fully deserved. He was up against big directors such as David Lean (Doctor Zhivago), William Wyler (The Collector), John Schlesinger (Darling) and Robert Wise (The Sound of Music), with the latter taking the award. Teshigahara should have won in my opinion, but whatever, it's an honor to be nominated.Eiji Okada, who some of you may know from Hiroshima mon Amour, is amazing in the leading role. I think it's the best performance in any Japanese film I've seen, and by any Japanese actors as well, and I've watched pearls like Seven Samurai, Rashomon, Yojimbo etc. If you haven't watched this, do it already.

14158,"“Stop this sociological drivel!”Nobody gets out of January unscathed. The post-holiday hangover of financial reckoning, lingering sickness, brooding depression, aggressively dismal weather and just plain old goddamn doldrums. January is, without fail, the most trying, and humbling month of the year. Better to get it out of the way up top, I reckon. You know things are getting grim for yours truly if I’m giving my mortal cinematic nemesis, Stalker, another day in court. Especially after having bailed on it like 15 minutes in, three separate times in previous attempts. But I’m almost done reading Dostoyevsky’s The Idiot, and felt my emotional pump was primed for some bad-vibe Russian existentialism. Today is the 4th anniversary of my most recent run of sobriety. I know this not only due to the app on my intelligent telephone perpetually counting the seconds as they tick by, but because January 15 is a dark, shameful day for me. January 15, 2020, I briefly left my wife and kids. I stormed out of my house because I wanted to get shitfaced, and hedonistically indulge my compulsively voracious appetites without any spoken or unspoken vows to hold me to account. Back in those days I walked around day and night like a furtive double agent. Jealous with my secrets and habitually inflamed like an exposed nerve. I bristled and I chafed and I nurtured grievance and I eventually snapped. I got free and clear of my home and my loved ones and began a debauch. But just a scant couple drinks in, the irretrievable totality of my catastrophically selfish decision paralyzed me, and before traversing too far astray, I begged my way back into the bosom of home and hearth. Single best choice I ever made. 2 months later, the pandemic hit. I’ve discovered who I actually am these last 4 years, and what I actually believe. I believe there is no god, and that control is an illusion. I believe clownish fallibility and entropic avarice are the way of all men, and the only worthwhile mission in life is to obliterate desire and abandon dreams. Reject fantasy and live in the now. Regiment your life with deprivation and challenge, and incessantly endeavor to think more of your responsibility to loved ones, and less of what you wish for yourself. My 46 years on earth have taught me that ambition is a rope we hang ourselves with. Just one of a million lies we whisper in the darkest recesses of our hearts. The root falsity of such multifarious deception being that there is any purpose or meaning to life beyond lying in the bed that you have made. And preferably lying in it as unobtrusively as is humanly possible. Nothing will kill the pain of being a man quite so efficaciously as retiring from the deluded pursuit of transcending being one. Stop searching for that which has already been found. But don’t listen to me. This is just how I’m living now. The weigh station I’m currently waylaid at on my journey. Don’t listen to anybody. Scoundrels and charlatans, the lot of them. Greedy wolves and creeping lepers brusquely dumping virginal nerds trapper keepers in junior high hallways. The air rank with coltish aggression and suffocating pheromones. Hormonal attitude adjustments and cryptoid community service officers. There is no perceivable existence save the one we’re all currently experiencing, so exist with that fact foremost in your mind. You know what kind of person you want to be, you know the necessary steps needed to arrive at that end result. So take them. If you stumble, or backslide, take a deep breath, steel yourself, get up, brush yourself off, and keep walking the path you know you belong on. There’s literally nothing else to do. Remember what poor old Layne said. “I feel so alone, gonna end up a big old pile of them bones”. That’s us. Momentarily upright and perambulating bone piles.  Last night I was driving home from IKEA (fucking January) and suddenly remembered that I technically died 12 and a half years ago. I felt immense pride in myself for being such a survivor. I could have rolled over and got so much worse after that vicious spanking life gave me. Except I did the opposite. I’m stronger now than I’ve ever been. Physically, mentally and psychologically. But the second I begin to let things slide, to eat too much, to skip workouts, to let those worms of reverie bore holes of corrosive dissatisfaction through my gray matter, the cycle of degradation begins anew and all hope is gone. A 250 pound souse clutching his left pectoral as electric shocks wrack him convulsively while his arteries burst and rupture like stymied sewage mains. You know what the only thing worth wishing for is? The only thing truly worthy of your grasping desire? Another day in which to try and do it better than you did the day before. Every other wish is spiritually cancerous, infantilizing folly. In any case, Stalker is super fucking boring. I really wish Tarkovsky’s films appealed to me more. Because he seemed to have been preoccupied with a lot of the same things I am. His movies need to be 90 minutes long and have a Dracula in them or something, cause Jesus Christ, dude.

The aspect ratio thing is an interesting choice. It deliberately limits compositions, but I think it's a really boring rationale to say that it reflects the characters feeling ""trapped"". Rather I think it's suggesting that their emotional instability and/or mental illness renders them unable to experience the fullness of any particular moment. It's easy to see why some folks think it's purely a gimmick though, more of the same from a filmmaker whose detractors claim is somewhat of an overweening punk, but I think that's a bit disingenuous. Then again, I found myself wondering why the narrative required a hypothetical near-future law that enables Die to have Steve committed given that he's demonstrably violent and a felon, and it seems possible, maybe even likely, that this is Dolan's construct (again, emotional not rational) to create an explicit rejection rather than a wrenching circumstance, insisting that he wants to be accepted unconditionally or abandoned entirely.",5,mommy-2014
32971,"First Tarkovsky film I ever watched: This is sin. You do not introduce anyone to Kid A until they’ve experienced Ok Computer. Likewise, you do not introduce anyone to THE MIRROR until they’ve seen every other one of his films. I suggest THE MIRROR be watched last for several reasons. First, ease your way into Tarkovsky’s glacially-paced style. Long, extended scenes are meant to slow down this MTV generation. He’s creating a meditative mood, and here it can be most exhausting.Second, know this is profoundly autobiographical. It’s easier to slip under its spell when you’ve had a taste of his earlier work. All prior meditations on Russian history, culture, politics, and identity culminate into something very personal in THE MIRROR.The result will be a highly non-linear, surreal rumination on the intimate details of Tarkovsky’s life. His childhood during WWII. His family abandoning their home in Moscow during the war. His father leaving to join the fight. This all jacked him up bad.Third, the film hallucinates images that self-reflexively point to Tarkovskys later life when he fled Russia entirely. He was an exile too grieved by a warring Soviet Union  and all its doublespeak and censorship. It’s missable if you don’t see this theme grow early on.Fourth, all these events haunt his work and they’re easier accessed elsewhere. When you see how these events permutate and translate cinematically from film to film, whether in memories, dreams, or emotional exile, you see how THE MIRROR better fits within Tarkovsky’s larger canon.Finally, fifth, this film is just very, very heavy. You need to exercise some Tarkovskian muscles to lift up and bear its biographically fat mood. You do that by starting with anything but THE MIRROR as your first Tarkovsky watch. Make it your last.Tarkovsky Ranked",5,mirror

15388,"Longtober #11 Demons, puppets, a creekside chapel. Statues reanimated, moving pictures, metaphysical theatre. Ghosts, family, an existential question.I'm completely astounded, and a little confused.There is no doubt in my mind that Fanny and Alexander is a masterpiece. To use this time to rehash the endless praise this film has received over the years would be time wasted. Everything I'd heard about it (and about Bergman himself) is true and then some. The film is an astounding vision that somehow captures the thematic weight of humankind through a portrait of faith, family, and soliloquy. To repeat acclaim given probably more eloquently than I ever could, I feel, for this film especially, is something not worth my time.Instead, I wish to express regret for not watching his other films beforehand. During a lot of this film, I felt confused. Impressed, but confused. About Bergman's meditations and philosophy on religion, about his views of family and the bourgeois, about the reason it's called Fanny and Alexander despite Fanny barely being a part of the movie. I felt like if I had watched Winter Light or Seventh Seal beforehand, the ideas expressed throughout the film would not have been so complicated for me to decipher.Nevertheless, the film is staggering. The performances, in particular, absolutely blew my mind. The way the metaphysical blended with the grounded tragedy told me a lot, despite my initial questions, about Bergman as a man and filmmaker.Can't wait to see more.

43501,"A fast pace mess of a film that I watched at entirely the wrong time. I remember choosing this film because it was a thriller, wanting to watch something a bit more upbeat to close the day off. Z has that rapid fire I was looking for, but without any development in character, resulting in a speedy film lacks anything to hold onto. While overtly political, the two opposing parties don’t stand for anything more than both being corrupt, which allows just about anyone to view the film, but also means the viewer doesn’t exactly care what happens to either side. The first half of the film showcases the events that lead to all the commotion, only for the remainder of the film to be a debate regarding what the viewer has already seen. If the tension hinges on uncovering what exactly happened in the car drive-by, it’s baffling why the film opens on the exact details of that incident. The dialogue becomes a mumble of unintelligible jargon, characters talking about what’s already been shown but getting it entirely wrong. It might have been interesting to watch them slowly come to the correct conclusion if I could have followed who was on who’s side, but as these characters aren’t ever properly established, I lost track of the debate. Maybe I’ll watch this again and understand its brilliance, but as it stands, I’m confounded how this sloppy mess could ever be praised. Overall, a quickly paced movie that has nothing for the audiences to latch onto to guide them through.",2,z
60155,"Boring. Inept. Pointless.This film is just so fucking terrible. Giving this movie a full one star is more than this abysmal mess deserves, but it’s portrayal of Gendo was really good here and I give credit to it. The rest of the characters are ruined, though.This is an example of character assassination, taking the brilliance of the show and morphing it into a Frankenstein‘s monster of fan service and fan fiction using Evangelion’s characters and new annoying characters. There’s quite a lot of pointless nudity to appease the horny perverted fanbase; nudity I don't mind and would usually praise, but here it’s tasteless and shoved in your face so often, you can’t help but feel this movie was not made based on story and rather made to sell tickets.As a fan of the original series, I find myself surprised that there’s so much praise for this. I’ve seen a lot of negative reviews, but mainly from people who aren’t longtime fans of the show or at least not into it as much. I think this is probably getting so much praise, mainly because part of the fanbase only cares for this nonsensical fan fiction garbage and partly because it took so long to come out. This movie seems to be made for people who would rather sacrifice the story, message and character’s personalities for the sake of shipping and fulfillment of an overblown ridiculous ending.I’ll go through each of the main characters in attempt to highlight my issues:Starting with Mari, the most God awful character of the whole movie. She’s a worthless, unnecessary sham. Every time she is on screen, I cringe at her dialogue and ridiculous personality. Finally, we now know the true purpose of why they introduced this character; it was merely to give Shinji a romantic partner and someone to fuck. She has no fucking chemistry with him whatsoever, but of course they need to have her hook up with him.Asuka is also ruined in this, having been revealed as a clone, which only works for Rei’s character and makes no sense for Asuka. Asuka has become a real simp for Shinji in these reboot movies, going so far as to confess feelings for him just to appease shippers. Although not much comes out of it, it’s mostly all spoken and used for a ridiculous count to Shinji’s love interests.I’ve never been a Rei fan, but I’ve always respected the character and found her interesting. In this film, she’s unbearable. From lounging in a bath with old women, farming crops and constantly asking questions about EVERY LITTLE THING, she’s reduced to nothing. The copying of End of Evangelion for her is so terrible in this which I’ll talk about later.Shinji is fairly annoying in this as well. He’s always been a real shrimp, but he’s just so... bland and whiny here - In a bad way. They had some good stuff with him and his father, but that’s the best I can give him.The storyboards and Gendo’s part in this were great. I felt the connections between him and his son are finally addressed and his story fully told. The storyboard visuals were really beautiful and the whole talk between him and Shinji was nice.I’m very upset with how they handle Kowaru in this. Kowaru Nagisa, one of the best handled gay characters I know of, is totally ruined and butchered here. I can’t stand how most of modern entertainment handles LGBT characters, making them tokens. Here, we get a fucking explanation that Kowaru is not gay, but in fact just attracted to Shinji because they are one in the same and wants to make Shinji happy to make himself happy. They end up pairing him up with Rei of all people. Fuck, it’s awful.So on top of all this character and story garbage, the animation for the fight scenes are not very good. They’re watchable at best, but mainly just poorly edited. Sometimes it’s hard to see the fight happening or sometimes the CGI is terrible. There’s a lot of bad CGI in this film; notably the Gendo vs Shinji Eva fight, Rei’s body doubles of the Eva Imaginary sequence and the stupid realistic face of giant Rei. They basically copy End of Evangelion’s use of her with the instrumentality, but just uglier and poorly edited.There’s also some really annoying flashing of lights and seizure inducing imagery in some scenes, most are just irritating and hard to even see what’s happening.Complete hogwash. I was never really bored with any of Evangelion’s media, save for the previous film before this, which honestly was a well made film, but just not to my liking. Here, it’s fucking awful. Bored out of my mind, I could only take interest in Gendo’s story - was totally disappointed and disgusted by this rebooted mess.",1,evangelion-3010-thrice-upon-a-time

The film also manages to tackle several themes and doesn't shy away from violence and aggression, pulling you in and keeping you hooked from start to finish. Maybe I should have watched this sooner, but I'm still fairly new to anime as a whole and am yet to see most of the classics. So this awesome cyberpunk drama seemed like a great place to start.

Hated almost everything about this movie. While the film obviously looks really nice, with its nice framing and its dark bleak aesthetic. A lot of vivid details that can grasp a viewers anttention. (It didn’t for me at all) other from that, this film has nothing else to fuckin offer! It is boring, it’s stupid, and just fuckin annoying!!!! I thought Bergman would deliver some compelling dialogue, like he has done with autumn sonata and persona, but this film had an overload of unnecessary amount of tedious and tiresome conversation pieces, that were drawn out excessively long. Extreme attempts of tension building which just completely fall of, just like Barry Lyndon’s son did off the horse! The movie is obviously very monologue heavy, basically like a play. but that style doesn’t do anything for me. I’ve felt more connected to Little red riding hood school plays when I was 9 years old!Nothing compelled me here, I didn’t care about anything. I had no emotional connection to anything. The story itself sounded pretty enthralling when I first read about it, but my god it is absolutely horrendous!!!!!! Obviously there is somewhat of a strong and complex aspect behind this story, which I couldn’t care enough to really look into or even appreciate. I was just really struggling to focus on this piece of shit!!! The whole “game of chess with death” was definitely the coolest aspect about this film, I mean it’s a great idea, but they still absolutely wasted it. I mean they don’t even play chess? Like cmon Bergman what the fuck we’re you thinking here?!!!The film as a whole is like watching the final act of apocalypse now 10 times in a row. It’s unbelievably dreadful!It’s a bunch of Swedish twats running around screaming, acting like clowns for 90 minutes! And then a cunt in a black cloak staring at them, forcing himself to look intimidating, when he’s not! It’s just Alvin from the straight story, but sent back to the fourteenth century!!!! The guy is called “death” but he’s better when they talk about him, rather than when you see him! A bit like Kurtz in apocalypse now!!!One of the worst films I’ve ever laid my eyes upon, this would get a 0.5 if it wasn’t for the visuals and camera work.

This film may be decent formally, but frankly, at its core it has a rather backwards, uninformed, and deplorable morality.It's not enough for John Coffey to be a magical Other - the film also has to portray him for gross white-guilt-infused sentimentality that is so demeaning he might as well be an animal or non-human entity. Coffey is basically no more human than Old Yeller or the Iron Giant. Then he's subtly touted as ""a good one"" that has a heart of gold, despite being reduced mentally and severely uneducated. All Coffey wants to see before he dies is ""a picture show;"" cinema is as magical to him as it would be homo erectus (and that's ignoring the screwy religion-as-control overtones to his verbal response). And THEN, on top of all that regrettable ""well-meaning"" racism (or quasi-race-blindness, the patronizing gaze of a ""non-racist"" white colonialist mindset), Coffey is exploited to improve the lives of whites, not only through healing and sexual empowerment but also by rooting out the ""bad whites.""Coffey is essentially the neoliberal white male dream for subordinate blackness: to be less educated, to be less than, to be neutered, yet to act in a supporting role to boost white morality, health, and sexual performance and meanwhile provide whites with unending guilt by being pure. Think Get Out, except re-purposing black bodies is an honorable and good thing.Oh, and I should probably mention that, plot-wise, Coffey is merely a living object (a McGuffin, if you will, though certainly not in the traditional sense) since his only character traits are being magical, being dumb and impotent, and having a very large, muscular body.Yeah, sure, it's competently made (though largely uninspired), but this is a fucked up movie, period.",2,the-green-mile

Taking advantage of this, the luckiest hire the most needy to risk their lives doing highly dangerous work, but I think this could be summarized quickly and not as long as the movie does, because the introductory dialogues and conversations of the characters extend from the first act to the middle of the second act, and that is where the dense dominates the film, the suspense is another of the sections that do hit the nail on the head but only the third act of the film is there, in fact the third act is where the purpose of the film matters because the rest is not so much, the rest feels like it could have been easily summarized.Obio I don't detract from the very real work that the film did with the roads and creating a frustrating aura in the face of flat details, if it were only for the third act, ugh I would rate it more but the long introduction upset me a lot when watching the film.",4,the-wages-of-fear

47540,"Never have I watched a film that appears to be universally acclaimed so grossly stereotypical, offensive, and genuinely disconnected from reality as this.  A meandering, surface level melodrama lasting almost three hours, Farewell My Concubine embodies the worst aspects of cinematic storytelling that I have seen not only from Chinese cinema, but the art form in general.One of the biggest flaws I see in this movie is with its extremely hurtful and disgusting portrayal of women and gay men throughout.  The main character, Dieyi, spends the entire film pining away for his best friend; this would be fine if that wasn't his entire character.  I wish I was exaggerating, but Leslie Cheung spends this entire film acting as an effeminate gay man (though there are themes regarding gender exploration, but those are also grossly shallow and ridiculous) the audience is expected to pity and empathize with solely because he cannot be with the man he loves.  There is nothing else to his character besides small little traits scattered throughout a vast runtime (which would have provided enough space for there to be actual humanistic writing) such as him being abusive to his adopted son, being antagonistic to his best friend's wife (further perpetuating the scorned, extremely jealous and petty stereotype that has been a part of queer coding since the beginning of cinema), and really loving the Beijing Opera.  None of the above traits mentioned are ever shown in a negative light, either; towards the end of the film, the film expects me to react with disgust to Dieyi's treatment during a struggle session (essentially public humiliation events that occurred to people deemed reactionaries during the Cultural Revolution) initiated by his son.  Am I supposed to care for this man who inflicted cruel punishments upon his son (mimicking the horrendous child abuse shown in the first thirty minutes of the film, which is never really examined beyond giving context to Dieyi and Xialou's relationship)?  I really could not care less.  When Dieyi fulfills his fate as a tragic, hopeless homosexual at the end of the film through killing himself (like all good gay characters should!), I felt nothing but contempt for him and the filmmakers for having the audacity to present his character as some beautiful understanding of gay people and their oppression.Another example of horrendous character writing and misogyny is found with the character of Xialou's wife, Juxian.  Almost like a foil to Dieyi, she spends the majority of the film trying to keep the former away from his stagemate while also dealing with the scorn of the filmmakers (she undergoes a miscarriage for really no other reason than to further demonize the communists, whose greatest flaws stem from them... not liking the Beijin Opera and the culture of wealth and abuse surrounding it).  Juxian is another object of pity, but until the end, she is simultaneously a vessel of hatred for the audience.  If only Juxian wasn't so controlling, so bitchy, so womanly, maybe Dieyi would be able to lead a better life with his love... right?I could go on and on about the exploitation of child abuse and child rape that occurs earlier in the film, or about the blatant fascist apologia that happens after the fall of Japanese imperialism (there are many instances throughout Farewell My Concubine where different characters echo the sentiment that the Chinese revolutionaries are somehow worse than literal occupant war criminals because ""at least the Japanese appreciated opera""), or about the obvious Western audience this film meant to attract through its exaggerated Chinese mysticism and reliance on foreign assumptions about the country to spurn the plot into motion, but I won't.  No one wants to read a disgustingly long review like this, and I thank you if you've come so far.  Before I end the review, I would also like to touch on some technical aspects of the film:- The cinematography feels cheap and needlessly hazy until about the final twenty minutes- The acting, though good at some points, relies far too much on exaggeration and the confines of melodrama to really affect me in any way- Besides the wonderful traditional Opera music during the performances, the soundtrack to Farewell My Concubine is unremarkable and harms the tension of some scenes- The sound mixing is amateur and has no consistency from scene to sceneThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",1,farewell-my-concubine

46681,"The Criterion Challenge, 85/1001987 RankedWings of Desire is my first Wim Wenders film and it is certainly an interesting entry point to the one of the more heralded directors of the late 20th Century. A classic and beloved by cinema fans worldwide, Wings of Desire is a partially black-and-white and partially color film in which an angel falls in love with a woman he has been keeping an eye on and decides to move into the world of humans in order to be with her. Remade as City of Angels with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan in 1998, Wings of Desire is naturally about a lot more than this simplistic romance. Focusing in on the relations between humans and forces beyond our imagination, Peter Falk starring as Peter Falk, looking at human existence and the role of pain and love, and examining the relationship between consumers and art as well as art’s role in this world, Wings of Desire is a powerful work, one that is as technically proficient as it is thematically moving.At times, Wings of Desire can feel like Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s A Matter of Life and Death. Visually, the blending of black-and-white with color often in the same scene, while using the former for the world of angels and the latter for the world of the humans is certainly inspired by Powell & Pressburger’s masterpiece. The implications are the same with the world of the living being worth it for the feelings that can be felt, while those from the world of angels are relegated to a colorless, far duller existence. Thematically, the film’s even both explore the power of love. For the angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz), he falls for a woman, Marion (Solveig Dommartin), who is a trapeze artist. Seeing her for the first time as he is just milling about doing angel business, his world suddenly jumps to color as he sees her. Later, it does the same again. This change in color also suggests a change in point of view - as the film briefly goes from being seen through Damiel’s eyes to being seen through Marion’s - but the impact she has on Damiel is very clear. Considering he later decides to move into the world of the living in order to find her, the power that love possesses has clearly drawn him into the world of humanity. Yet, as an angel who can read the thoughts of everyone in the world, he has seen great suffering. Humanity’s existential dread permeates much of the film with Wings of Desire’s voice-overs from a multitude of characters ultimately probing humans contemplating why they are, why they are here, and what they are supposed to be doing. Few people seem to be happy, they are often quite morose with the angels desperately trying to help them, yet not always being successful with one young man even killing himself over what is assumed to be a girl. However, this balance of feelings is worth it for as Marion states, feelings and the ebb-and-flow of emotion is part of life. She even laments never having felt lonesome as it meant she was not a whole person yet, only reaching that point when she is first with Damiel. Love and being alive - with the feeling and energy that comes from both - makes everything worth it as it all comes together to add up to the fact that one is alive which is the most beautiful thing in the world. We have no idea why we are alive, we often feel pain and down, and yet we often feel joy, happiness, love, and anticipation. There are no answers given to why we are alive in Wings of Desire, rather the only thing it affirms is that everything is worth it.Wings of Desire is further an examination of art, whether libraries, films, or music. With the angels hanging out in a library, the final dedication to “former angels” such as Tarkovsky, Ozu, and Truffaut, the inclusion of Peter Falk as an actor and an artist, the scenes set at Nick Cave concerts, the celebration of the circus, the portrayal of a film set, and the appearance of an old man who speaks about storytellers and how the death of a storyteller means that a person’s childhood has ended, it is clear that the film is obsessed with art. It is obsessed with stories. The power, the poetry, the technique, and the style of art all sum up why life is worth living. Thus, it is no surprise that Wenders would explore this idea. It is a film that adores the arts, even portraying Falk as a former angel who came to Earth in order to make art. Meanwhile, Damiel takes on the role of a voyeur, a viewer of the arts, and is an angel who deeply appreciates it, rising into the world of the human and the artists in order to both live among that which he once observed and to possibly create his own. The possibilities are endless.Yet, in appreciating the arts, Wenders never omits the immense sacrifices. There is great beauty. As Damiel comes to the world to love Marion, he comes to the world to appreciate  up close the artistry he had admired from afar for his entire existence. But, he is also signing up for the whole package. In coming to the human world, he will feel pain and loss. In moving beyond his days as an auteur and being influenced by the artists he watched, he will suffer as the artists do. Wenders shows Falk worrying about his role, lamenting the story that is being told, and hating his own drawings. The film shows a film being made with Falk as the star, going through difficult takes and the director worrying about how it will all come together. Artists, their struggle to create, and their drive to create are all showcased. This is a beautiful film, but not one that looks over the blood, sweat, and tears shed in the name of creating something. For Wenders, the world needs artists. As with the old man lamenting the death of storytellers, the film showcases the destruction of buildings as the angels try to remember what the buildings were like and even relay to one another what people are doing/thinking. In the arts, they find that preservation, saving a moment in something consumable for the rest of eternity. In the arts, there is great beauty that is able to tap into real human emotion, which is what draws the angels to try to utilize their knowledge of humanity - gleamed through decades of study - to touch humanity in this way. It is this move that Wenders claims Falk, Tarkovsky, Truffaut, and Ozu once made, shedding light on so much of the human condition that they had learned from their prior roles as voyeurs who learned from the artists/people they watched for years. Yet, while the world needs artists, the sacrifice - not least of which is immortality for the angels - is immense and, for that, artists deserve the love and admiration they get for, if they were not there, where would humanity be?In creating Wings of Desire, Wenders is able to embody the ideas he puts forth. Not only is Peter Falk a self-reflexive touch, but the film’s portrayal of Germany and of filmmaking serve as both a time capsule and a demonstration of the art form, respectively. For the former, some critics have noted the different portrayal of East and West Berlin, with Wenders utilizing the setting and the film to both comment on and depict the state of Berlin in 1987. The film even depicts bombed out buildings, comments on Nazis, and shows how films were made in 1987. All of this serves as the preservation that the angels in the film are shown to love about art, saving all of this information for study in the years to come. In terms of filmmaking, the film showcases what the medium is capable of with Wenders’ work being technically astute. With gorgeously ambitious crane shots, frequent close-ups, a terrific performance from Bruno Ganz brought to life by those close-ups, and the incredible usage of black-and-white blended with color, Wings of Desire is a visually striking film throughout. It all culminates with the impeccable closing shot of Damiel watching Marion do her trapeze act in color while fellow angel Cassiel (Otto Sander) watches in the background in a spec of black-and-white. Earlier shots of Marion spinning around while in black-and-white only to spin rightside up into color, showcase the lengths that Wenders is willing to go to in Wings of Desire. Not only are these elements all gorgeous, but they all capture the right tone or emphasize a theme in just the right way, all while showcasing the possibilities that exist when one moves from the world of the voyeurs to the world of the artists by grabbing a camera. It is a world of imagination, of creativity, of artistry, and incredible feats with Wenders determined to showcase them all.Poetic, beautiful, and powerful, Wings of Desire is a great introduction to Wim Wenders. While, at first, I was a bit unimpressed with the film, it quickly won me over in the second half as the film’s themes came together and every single movement began to make sense. It is an experience to be sure, and one that only increases in its impact/brilliance as one reflects on the film.",7,wings-of-desire

Even Guido (Marcello Mastroianni) learning to treat others with the barest moniker of respect becomes a personal revelation granted to him by his 'angel'. A servile symbol that in her agency has no purpose other than to reflect the desires of the male protagonist. Salvation indeed. Your own religious adherence to self-expression (read 'nationality') creates a conflict of belief in the bending of the will of any oppositional force to the personal artistic project (a theme which I am finding increasingly boring and ill-thought through): a saviour of yourself; only without the complexity of added guilt vis-à-vis trauma and abuse as a conviction rather than a sacrificial element of reckoned disbelief that's present in Hacksaw Ridge.

I gave it a chance... well it seems like I'm going to talk about a real unpopular one but it isn't the case. Anyway I can't get how people love it that much. I understand the message, trying to face The Holocaust with a smile on your mouth for the purpose of making it less bad, a father who tries to hide the reality of a tough life making his son think that Life is beautiful. Trying to find the good part of the bad things to make a bad situation into a better one. What does he think up? He makes up a game of their stay in a concentration camp in order to make his stay lighter taking advantage of his innocence.I feel like in the way the movie is focused there is no place for humor, this was cheap and annoying but it wasn't the best background to mix sad situations with a humor touch.I can enjoy a comedy about The Shoah if it's only based on making the viewer laugh but it tries two things here: create a feeling of sadness in the viewer while watching these conditions of vulnerability (which were real) and make the viewer enjoy them with this kind of humor, which is disgusting enough in my opinion.Not a recommended movie for those who think like me about combining sadness with happiness using an annoying humor.",3,life-is-beautiful

32794,"Zerkalo is possibly the most personal and also the most cryptic work of Andrei Tarkovsky. In it he avoids conventional narrative to evoke memories of his childhood, his mother, and episodes from the history of his country, to create some sort of sensorial autobiography. I have had an experience similar to those I encountered with other works by Tarkovsky; namely, his unintelligible reflections, the excruciatingly slow pace, and his almost impenetrable metaphors are so vast and unattainable for the most part that I feel overwhelmed. As if that weren't enough, the use of classical music, mirrors everywhere, and his need to bestow everything with a symbolism seem to vociferate: contemplate visual poetry at its maximum expression! this is art! What I have never questioned is the impressive capacity of the Russian filmmaker to capture the overwhelming beauty that surrounds him, like those childhood memories that look like nineteenth-century naturalist paintings. The problem is that this beauty is sterile to me because I cannot simply lose myself in it, I can not just experience this mystical and spiritual journey and, therefore, it does not  move me at all nor do I find it interesting or stimulating. Until now I thought that I was just being stubborn when it comes to Tarkovsky cinema, trying my best to decipher it and refusing to admit defeat. Now, I have realized that his universe is not entirely indecipherable to me, it is simply not of interest to me.",4,mirror
35226,"Film #93 from the list of recommendations, first of four from Andrea.You liked depressed teen film. You liked depressed young adult film, you liked depressed senior film. Now you can see depression for all agesI had extremely high hopes for this. An enormous, slow, and depressive meditation on hopelessness. Add to that, the fact that it is made by a student of Tarr, one of my absolute favorite filmmakers. All of those expectations aren't unfulfilled, but largely An Elephant Sitting Still shows a very promising director still trying to find his unique voice. The style of Tarr is very much so worn on the sleeve, which isn't necessarily an issue, however it does have the unfortunate side-effect of invoking comparisons between the two. For example, the literary device of the titular Manzhouli elephant appears initially as a defining aspect of the film, but formally, functions very similarly to devices already employed by the Hungarian master. Throughout, it represents an absurd and inexplicable object of intrigue, much like the whale in Werckmeister Harmonies, and in the film's irresolute, and surprisingly very predictable conclusion, the device feels like a reincarnation of one of the great endings of cinema in Satantango, or Breaking the Waves for that matter. Hu Bo does succeed somewhat in finding his own brand of bleakness and discomfort however. With a cinematography that remains throughout the film just a little too close, complementing the narrative which is just a little too intimate, and a general landscape that I can only describe as the dull light of a perpetually overcast day on concrete. Every aspect of the film channels the hopelessness that the director is intent on conveying. Most of all, this is of course expressed in the dialogue of the characters, which isn't very elegantly constructed. In one of the less befitting scenes of the film even emulates the screaming into the infinite abyss scene of The Garden State, with some additional bleakness. The metempsychosis style parallels between the three male main characters superficially an appealing feature, but I find it also makes the film much more predictable. It is gradually revealed, but is obvious from the first act of the film. Another of the primary defining features of the film is it's runtime of almost four hours (fun fact, should you wish to spend a day on a double feature of this and Satantango the duration of the two films adds up to 666 minutes), which the director rightly insisted should not be cut down, since the duration is instrumental in conveying the dominating emotion of the entire cast of characters. However, also this feature makes way for another of the shortcomings of the film. In slow films, at least if one takes a holistic view of film, rhythm of editing becomes much more important than in shorter films. Rhythm is one aspect that the film seems to lack entirely. While strongly developed in subsegments of the film, at others it seems thrown out of the window completely, between the long takes and tracking shots that define the cinematic grammar of the film. Conversely, these long takes are one of the more unique and formally brilliant features of the film and have a quality of taking on the instability of its characters. Hu Bo shows a lot of promise in his directorial feature debut, but here his maturity as a filmmaker isn't quite able to keep up with his artistic ambition, which also seems a little underdeveloped. Nevertheless, his career would have been very interesting to continue to follow and it is a shame that his bright light was quenched so soon.",6,an-elephant-sitting-still

44188,"This film focusing heavily on an underground lifestyle of drug use and debauchery when also trying to provide representation of an under-represented and easily misunderstood group enforces negative stereotypes through establishing a distancing effect in the majority of the audience. The protagonist of the film being subject to unimaginable trauma and serving as a cipher in an Oedipus story exacerbates this distance and creates troubling parallels between trauma and gender non-conformity. This functions as a poor choice when considering any potential audience for this movie: 1) Audiences unfamiliar with this sort of trauma now can relegate their thoughts on this sort of gender orientation as being due to trauma which they cannot relate to and contributes to the protagonist manifesting as an unfamiliar ""other"", which is something the film should be moving away from if it is meant to provide an empathetic window into a group outside mainstream society.2) Audiences that have experienced any sort of similar trauma in the past will be propagated negative thought complexes of futility through the film's commitment to its nihilistic perspective.The ""on-the-street"" interviews, which are a fantastic idea in concept as they provide a direct view into real gender non-conforming individuals, are incredibly non-probing and insubstantial. This could act as an essential document of positive representation if it was given sufficient attention and letting the subjects express their feelings about their sexual choices, mainstream society's view of them, and what they feel positive representation would be. Instead we are left with ""why are you gay""-tier sketches that, in a skeptical audience, could easily read as the central subjects being vacuous rather than the filmmakers.The film's constant self-references are another contribution to distance and read as the film being insecure in its own content. There is value in postmodern works questioning the machinations of media and communication. However, for these techniques to be utilized so heavily in a film that should ideally establish an understanding towards a marginalized group, these effects work counter to these goals. In particular the sequences focusing on the arthouse filmmakers and associates, involving drug use and sexual debauchery, can be read either as an aggrandization of this behavior as a way towards liberation (which I view as a very destructive perspective) or a critique. As a critique it fails due to failing to provide a nuanced perspective on the central failings of the group or suggest any potentials for improvement (compare the methods utilized in Godard's La Chinoise as an example in which this critique could work positively). Surprisingly, the most substantial perspective offered in the film is provided in an incredibly short sequence involving a violent revolutionary, which provides a very convincing, although admittedly basic, justification for violent political acts when justified by logical context. However, this aspect of the film is given minimal focus, and it is a shame the same thoughtfulness could not be afforded the film's main focus.Addendum: I do not want to create the impression that every instance of positive representation needs to explicitly subvert stereotypes or pander to accepted norms of mainstream behavior, as I think the only base criteria for positive representation is encouraging a fundamental empathy. However, I think my central problem with this film is that, through the distancing effects outlined in this review, it becomes more akin to a freak show than an opportunity for  understanding. A freak show is not an example of positive representation as it upholds peoples preconceptions that these marginalized groups exist outside of relatability. There was an opportunity for a landmark of queer cinema in this film, but it failed due to insecurity in its own subject matter.Addendum #2 [2024-02-28]: I think Matsumoto has great skills as an aesthete, the shorts contained in this film, the film itself and Matsumoto's other shorts (Expansion in particular is very striking to me) are revolutionary in their cutting and textural manipulation. However, I think he struggles when applying that same sensitivity to people, and would rather push his aesthetic impulses than be thoughtful in how he's representing the queer subculture being depicted. And under the paradigm I consider art, I would rather have exemplary sensitivity towards people than sensitivity towards formal or aesthetic elements in film. For films from around the same time that deal with people in a marginalized group in a more empathetic and sensitive way, I much prefer John Cassavetes' Shadows or Shirley Clarke's Portrait of Jason. Or even more specifically in a film that adapts both queer street life in conjunction with a recontextualized literary adaptation, I think Gus Van Sant's My Own Private Idaho is much preferable to me in execution than this film.",1,funeral-parade-of-roses

Despite that, he is able to tell this powerful tale based on actual trial minutes. The photography is beautiful and the close-ups create such real emotion. The accompanying score adds to the emotion and drives the excitement. Maria Falconetti is remarkable as Joan. Her facial expressions, body trembles, and wide eyes create a masterful performance. The opening questioning of Joan is a little slow but the small moments like seeing the shadow of a cross from the window are so well done. The crowning of Joan, the torture chamber and her arm bleeding are frightening. Joan eventually giving into the judges and signing the confession is depressing and the shaving of her head is eerie. The final sequence of this film is legendary. The shots of the fire are so impressive and the violence in the crowd is an incredible way to conclude this tragic story. “As Jesus is God’s son, do you consider yourself God’s daughter?”“It is you who is sent by the devil to make me suffer”“God moves in mysterious ways”👍61%Foreign list- Click HERE",6,the-passion-of-joan-of-arc

Absolutely not. Worst ending. Worst fucking ending. GODDAMN IT THIS WAS AT 3.5 STARS. Two whole stars down the drain, completely wasted. It's The Village all over again. Nightmares of Shutter Island return. I'll explain. This is a genre hybrid, a darkly comic blend of corny British wit, solid courtroom thrills, and seedy noir-ish crime. It's funny in spite of its dated and old-fashioned mannerisms, some choice zingers in the dialog and great chemistry from the cast. It's thoroughly engaging in spite of the obvious theatrical source material limiting any kind of really unique visual style. It's a drab, clinical-looking film, but it's elevated by what WERE good performances until the FUCKING ending! SPOILERS AHEAD. The film is about a man, a pretty shitty grifter, accused of murder when he benefits a shit ton of money from the murdered woman's will. The woman is not his wife but a friend, and his wife is the only one who can provide an alibi. A massively-obese, literally fucking DYING elderly lawyer who just gets drunk and smokes cigars all the time while sweating profusely and has JUST AWOKEN FROM A COMA after a heart attack just takes the case. Ok, weird, but funny. But then...The twist is that the wife, played by Marlene Dietrich, has an UNBELIEVABLY ABSURD plan involving the fact that she isn't actually his wife, and decides to implicate her not-husband in the crime as a (you guessed it) Witness for the Prosecution instead of for the defense. She then perjures herself by first telling the truth, then impersonating a surprise witness who provides forged evidence to deligitimize her own truthful testimony in order to get a not guilty verdict on her actually-guilty not-husband that she actually still loves, even though she's been pretending not to. Ok, so that's super convoluted but still technically possible and believable since their lawyer is high and drunk THE ENTIRE TIME. But the movie plays this off as just something people did back then. There's clearly non-water drinks being drunk by the judge. Wha...is this a farce? It doesn't seem like it....all the noir and courtroom shit and World War II social commentary is played straight and all the comedy is in the dialog and wit...and it only gets worse because even though all of that strains all credibility...it's the execution that just KILLS it:Marlene Deitrich's disguise and accent as she is impersonating a surprise witness is the worst thing I've ever seen, and it's played straight as believable by all involved. How? HOW???? It's obviously still Marlene Dietrich in bad scar makeup with the WORST cockney accent ever in history. It's like...as bad as if you were to make Noomi Rapace put on a thick Texan accent. Some actors can't hide their accent. Like Arnie or JCVD. I don't watch old movies, this is my first movie Deitrich's been in. For all you boomers or historians out there, did she ever hide her German accent?

64,"Crafted with measure, told with composure & steered by a strong lead showcase, Harakiri is a tale of honour, morals & all things bushido that takes its time to set up the premise, and then slowly & steadily unravels & escalates into a fierce conflict that lays bare the hypocrisy of the feudal system that emerged during that era.Directed by Masaki Kobayashi, this is my first stint with his works and the sublime control over many aspects that he exhibits is impressive. His direction takes a very calculated approach to bring the script to life, and the interest only magnifies as new details surface until it reaches its boiling point with a finale that's brutal yet heartbreaking.Themes of honour, morals, injustice, poverty & desperation drive the narrative but the film sure gets an additional facelift from its era-appropriate set pieces, crisp camerawork, controlled editing, gradual pacing & fitting music, all of which work in tandem to immerse us more into the brewing conflict. The actors play their part well too with Tatsuya Nakadai stealing the show, and the interplay between them all is engaging throughout.On an overall scale, Harakiri does live up to its hype for the most part, and is one of Japanese cinema's most essential works. Kobayashi's careful direction gradually escalates the drama while Shinobu Hashimoto's script celebrates the honour of a samurai but is also critical of the emerging feudal system of the said era, showing their virtues to be a facade. An ethically & morally complex period piece, Harakiri is definitely worth your time & money.Full review at High on Films",7,harakiri

There is so much nonsense on display with ambiguity being used as a cheap crutch rather than something that enhances the story or its themes. Characters range from bearable to downright dull and are hindered by how convoluted the whole thing is. I enjoyed the original series but thought it was pretty overrated and hoped a fresh take would appeal to me more, unfortunately it was just more of the same with a few major differences that led to a much better ending that still didn't feel as satisfying as I'd have liked even though I appreciate it being less ambiguous.

Forth, Eorlingas!” LOTR: The Two Towers is an excellent sequel to Fellowship of the Ring and so far it’s proving to be an awesome trilogy. The story is excellent and it’s just fun to follow these characters, they’re really likable and make me wanna cheer for them. I like following Frodo & Sam’s journey and now Gollum joins the journey as well and he is just such a fun character to watch, every time he was on screen he absolutely steals the show and I felt like this time there was way more time to connect with the characters, but I feel this one is not as good as the first one in my opinion. It does have amazing action once again and it has possibly one of the best battle sequences ever made, the cinematography and practical effects are fantastic once again. Peter Jackson just crafted a superb trilogy that is incredibly faithful to the source material that it’s based on and it just builds upon Tolkien’s universe beautifully, I’m excited to see Return of the King and how this story ends. The performances are just exceptional and everyone has amazing chemistry with each other once again, the dynamic between them is so good and I love these characters so much. Elijah Wood is fantastic as Frodo once again and McKellen kills it once again despite the shorter screentime this time around, Serkis also does a nice job as Gollum and the new additions are also great. The pacing is also pretty excellent for the most part, there are a few moments where it does feel slow, but for the most part I barely felt the three hour runtime and I loved this one almost as much as the first. So far this trilogy is excellent and I’m excited to see how everything concludes, it’s really faithful to the source material and Jackson just keeps on delivering banger after banger every time. Overall, LOTR: The Two Towers is an excellent film that is really engaging from start to finish, the story is fantastic once again and the characters are so much fun to follow and I loved every single minute of this. The performances are fantastic from everyone, especially Wood, McKellen & Serkis and I’m so excited to see how this trilogy ends and yeah I would highly recommend checking these films out if you haven’t already!",9,the-lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers
44661,"Part 14 of the February Film Challenge2nd Satyajit Ray (after The Hero)What stands out for me in Pather... is the incredible faces and landscapes, especially that of Chunibala Devi as the elderly aunt/sister in law (as my subtitles had it), a wide canvas of wrinkles and creases at the long and tiring life she has lived. Amongst the forests and fields of the wilderness, she has walked bent-backed in poverty until her final years can be spent bickering with her sister in law, her shawl torn and ragged. Her face is the most beautiful thing in the film, a delight to see against the grinding hardships that all around her suffer. The best bits of this film are those little moments of joy; a game with friends, candies from the sweets seller, a drama on a stage. And Ray is fabulous at capturing them, capturing the harsh beauty of the world around Apu in beautiful detail. The final shot is one for the ages. But, this is a film about childhood, and childhood is a subject I have no affection for, for reasons described previously. Yet it is understandably loved, that I can see.Satyajit Ray in Order:1.

6672,"Included In Lists:Criterion Collection - #804A Brighter Summer Day is a film that comes packing. It deals with a tremendous amount of themes and ideas that are pressed upon either with force or with graceful subtlety, at times escaping you if one becomes unfocused or is distant with the context that Edward Yang is playing with. For the most part, it provides a thorough portrait of young man’s life as we become witnesses to the experiences of 1960’s Taiwanese youth, intimately highlighting the yearning, injustices, and perceived helplessness enforced by the country’s sense of limbo in search of its identity and over-polluted corruption.Although I admire the lengths that Yang pushes himself in realising such a film, I do feel the film loses dramatic focus and emphasis in the film’s second half, where moments seem to linger rather than drive home their points, thus only finding focus and regaining impact upon the film’s final 20 minutes. The film’s key highlights are found during the film’s first half, in which character building and drama come hand in hand with rarely a dip in quality.There is a natural unfolding that certainly slowly attracts its viewers, and for the most part, I was on board with what Yang was pushing for, but this is a film that did not need to be as stretched as what it had resulted to be.",6,a-brighter-summer-day
55712,"============================Letterboxd Season Challenge 2015-16============================Week 20: January 31st-February 6thSci-Fi WeekAlthough I was living in Tokyo at the time this film was released, for the life of me I can't recall seeing any advertising for it. Somehow I missed it entirely, and it was not until the re-mastered English version became available in 2001 that I remember even hearing about it, although it is said to have had a significant influence on such films as ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""Chronicle"" (2012) and ""Looper"" (2012) -- all sci-fi films I have enjoyed.The story is based upon cyberpunk manga written by Katsuhiro Otomo, adapted for the screen by Otomo and Izo Hashimoto with Otomo as director. It presents a dystopian version of the city known as ""Neo Tokyo"" in 2019, some 31 years after World War III. A biker gang of college students led by orphan Shōtarō Kaneda and his sidekick Tetsuo Shima are bent on battling a rival gang known as the Clowns, while the rest of the city either is embroiled in anti-government riots or making preparations to host the XXXII Olympic Games in 2020 -- an uncanny prediction that has actually come true.When Tetsuo is injured in an accident, government troops whisk him away, supposedly to an undisclosed hospital. But the truth is that he encountered a ""esper"" (person with psychic powers) who had escaped from a top secret facility. Held for observation and tests by Colonel Shikishima, Tetsuo begins to exhibit psychic powers of his own, similar to those of three espers detained under military authority -- Kiyoko (No. 25), Takashi (No. 26) and Masaru (No. 27). There is also talk of an esper named Akira (No. 28), who apparently perished in an explosion of psychic energy at the start of the War in 1988.Kaneda becomes obsessed with finding his friend, which brings him into contact with a girl named Kei, who works for a resistance group. She and her boss Ryūsaku want to find Tetsuo and free him before the government can turn him to their purposes. At the same time, the elected officials of Neo Tokyo are considering relieving Shikishima of duty, owing to his apparent inability to keep the peace. However, the Colonel stages a coup d'état when Tetsuo escapes and the streets of the city are soon turned into a war zone.Some of the underlying themes here are provocative, including the concept of energy evolving and how absolute power, being uncontrollable, corrupts absolutely. The graphics are quite stunning and the plot proceeds at a frantically kinetic pace, punctuated by lots of gunfire, explosions and ground ruptures. It's easy to see how this has gained a cult following, and if the rumors are true that Christopher Nolan is involved in making a live action trilogy out of this, I expect there will be an explosion of Akira-mania in the near future, maybe just in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.",6,akira

I am not one to shy away from a difficult, twisted film, but I found it to be a male gaze exploitation film with loads of triggering SA sequences “exploring the objectification & mental health of women” with shock for shock value and eroticized rape. There is no backstory to connect you with the main character which made it feel soulless. It was incredibly traumatizing to watch, I actually went numb as soon as I realized what I was watching. After seeing an interview where the director said he was “having a little too much fun animating the rape scenes” it makes sense that I could feel that when watching the film. Having the (obvious) “twist” be that it wasn’t the grotesque male pervert but the only other female character made it feel like “bitches be cray” and I felt my soul lift. This film perpetrates the idea that ugly = deprived and deciding to animate the mentally ill female killer as an unattractive overweight has-been while showing her underside squeezing out of her costume was the kind of misogyny icing on the cake I didn’t need. PTSD activated.",0,perfect-blue

56020,"HeatIf they were still making Westerns, the plot of ""Heat"" would feel right at home. It's a movie about a dude from the East who gets tired of being pushed around and travels out West to take lessons in self-protection from a famous gunslinger. Does the story end with the timid city slicker standing up for his rights? Are there stars in the sky? But they don't make Westerns anymore, so ""Heat"" is an updated version of that reliable old plot, with a few new twists. The hero uses knives and martial arts, not guns. He lives in Las Vegas, a thoroughly modern Western city, and he is a compulsive gambler. The bad guy is the spoiled son of a Mafia don from Florida.And the final showdown takes place in a vast warehouse, just like the shoot-outs in at least 65 percent of all the other recent movies that end in shoot-outs. The only new twist is, this time, the soundtrack doesn't use Far-Off Rattles in the silence of the warehouse; it uses Echoing Drops of Water. There's always a basic shot in these scenes where a guy with a gun creeps along in the shadows, the gun held next to his face, the barrel pointing up. I've seen that shot enough for several lifetimes.The screenplay for ""Heat"" was written by William Goldman, one of Hollywood's top craftsmen, but he hasn't outdone himself this time.It's all recycled material from other movies - all except for some nice personal touches added by the actors. They bring style to a movie that needs it.I especially enjoyed Burt Reynolds' work as the professional tough guy. He's a bodyguard who lists himself in the Yellow Pages under ""chaperon,"" a Vietnam hero who is an expert in violence but cannot contain his own compulsion to gamble. In the movie's best sequence, he has a long winning streak at blackjack but finds that merely winning is never quite enough.One day an out-of-towner (Peter MacNicol) hires him as a bodyguard and asks for lessons in how to act tough. Judging by MacNicol's questions and Reynolds' answers, they're both cases of arrested development. MacNicol essentially wants to know how to keep that bully at the beach from kicking sand in his eyes, and Reynolds suggests pulling off the guy's ear (""It's surprisingly easy to do; it's only held on by a little cartilege, and when you show a guy his ear, it grabs his attention"").Reynolds is good in the movie's more sustained scenes, showing toughness and weariness and a certain wry humor. The movie is a reminder that he can be a very effective movie actor. Unfortunately, he has chosen to dedicate his recent career to predictable genre movies, and ""Heat"" turns out to be another one, especially after the spoiled Mafia punk from Miami arrives in town. I'm getting tired of movies where the bad guy's personality is the problem, and murdering him is the solution. Isn't there a more interesting way for human beings to interact? There are times when ""Heat"" feels like a sampler from Goldman's leftovers. The long opening sequence turns out to be a cheat on the audience. Early byplay between Reynolds and his partner (Howard Hesseman) suggests a buddy relationship that is short-circuited.There's a nice moment when MacNicol offers to help Reynolds with his gambling addiction, but that's never followed up. There's a good scene with the Mafia boss of Vegas, but then he disappears, never to be seen again. Diana Scarwid has an effective walk-on as a blackjack dealer, and then she's gone from the movie. And so on.The movie is filled with promising starts, but then everything dissolves into a violent action climax. There could have been a nice movie here about a coward and a gambler helping each other out. Or a lawyer and a bodyguard trying to make a living in Vegas. Or a gambler and a dealer falling in love. Or a Mafia boss trying to maintain order.Goldman has written the first scenes for all of those movies, strung them together and thrown in a shoot-out. This movie has everything it needs except for a middle and an end.",3,heat

The film’s general structure is very rigorous concerning composition, rhythm and art design, but very clumsy concerning narrative and meaning. If one tries to delve further beyond the film’s aesthetic ventures, one is left with little to nothing (so many useless redundancies, so many empty emphasis, so many deaf spots). Everything that Yimou wanted to say was already said during the film’s first sequence (in a rather ponderous and inelegant manner must I add) and the rest of it, despite showcasing many pleasures with Li’s face, the palpable geography of the castle and the narrative’s mean plotting against its characters, is just a vacuum of empty pictorialism.",4,raise-the-red-lantern

It shows that you shouldn't live your life with regret and you should take every chance you get. When I watched Before Sunrise, the scene where they sit in the listening booth while glancing at each other and looking away in embarrassment, was the scene where I truly noticed how incredible the film was. That's when it suddenly started to feel real. I haven't really experienced anything like it for a long time but with Before Sunset, I had that exact same feeling again. The car scene where they are going back to Céline's apartment and they both get very emotional. They both did a certain hand gesture that made me have that exact same feeling of it feeling ""real"". They both reached out to adjust the other's hair at two separate occasions. No matter how good the writing is, the cinematography or even the set design, those little details is what makes the cinematic experience feel unique. Those gestures were clearly referencing the first film when they are on the tram and it was a perfect thing to add. I've never really been a fan of open endings but these just feel right.

8701,"I’m always a bit wary when I approach a film that prominently features film in its plot. It seems an easy way to take a cinephiles love of film and blinding them to the actual quality of the film. I always have to ask if I’m loving the actual movie or simply loving my love of movies. Where a film like Cinema Paradiso differs from these other films is that it is essentially about that love of movies and not about referencing movie moments we love. Toto is a young Italian rascal who sneaks into the projectionist’s booth to snatch swaths of film. The projectionist, Alfredo, doesn’t take to kindly to him, but through Toto’s persistence and love of films, the two form a bond that lasts his childhood.Therefore, a large part of the movie is about watching people watching movies. This is the magic of the movie as we are shown the power of movies. As the crowded theatre watches the latest features, they experience a gambit of feelings and emotions that include wonder, fear, joy and sorrow. Also, the actual act of watching movies becomes its own distinctive memory as the entire movie is actually told as Toto’s recollection of his childhood.One thing worth noting about the scenes in the theatre is that it’s a communal event. The entire town comes out to watch movies together, ranging from the youngest lad to the eldest man. The act of watching brings everyone together under one roof. And watching these people share a movie experience speaks to the power of watching movies with people we know. Through this, we come to know a lot of these smaller characters that don’t actually do or say much.But beyond how much the film is about film, it also proves to be its own beautiful piece of cinema. Italian films by their very nature seem suited to cinema. Something about their architecture seems to inspire directors to linger on the beauty. Whether it be the rolling countryside or the city square, there’s a lot of fantastic imagery to be found in the film. The film also understands the other great element of film, which is the ability to condense time. The film covers not only the childhood days of Toto, but also jumps ahead to his teenaged years for the second half of the film. The framing device of elder Toto remembering his childhood days is another way that the film plays with time, providing a way to tie everything together in an interesting way. And the framing device does present a good taste of nostalgia. The use of the nostalgic argument is one I often find myself railing against. Here, it’s subdued through the fact that the film does keep the framing device to a nice minimum.  And films certainly do have the power to conjure up memories and transport us back to a time earlier in our lives.Cinema Paradiso captures the joys of watching films without ever having to simply appeal to movies we love. It stands strongly as its own distinct picture that has a moving story of its own to tell. It’s a reminder of what can make film so great and how it can shape our lives and become part of our identity. It’s certainly something anyone who loves movies will be able to identify with as it hits upon so many things that make us venture out to the theatres.",7,cinema-paradiso

It is an avalanche of sentiment anchored by a horrendous and annoying performance by Takashi Shimura. Man, if I had to look at Shimura and his wide-eyed sad face for one more minute, I was gonna turn this thing off. It seemed to me like he had more than just stomach cancer. He could barely control his speaking or his facial contortions. Shimura is so hellbent on begging for audience sympathy, it's as though there's no faith in Kurosawa or the script. The ending scenes of politicians talking about Watanabe's life are endless and excruciating to endure. We get it: he was a good man who helped build a park.

The story takes place over the Christmas break at a prestigious boarding school.  A cantankerous professor is forced to stay behind at the school with a small group of boys who are not able to return home.  The small group soon turns to just one.  At this point the movie blossoms.Two people who randomly (or nearly so) find themselves together discover truths about each other and themselves.  They learn that human connection, love, and empathy are essential to nurture the human spirit.Paul Giamatti delivers an amazing performance as the professor.  And young actor, Dominic Sessa, makes his film debut.  We will see more from him, I am certain, as his performance was outstanding.The Holdovers is a story with heart, depth, and emotion.   The story is subtle.  It is not shoved down your throat, it is given time to develop and make its emotional impact.   It is far from your typical Christmas movie--which only makes it better.Final thought--there were a bunch of great one-liner insults in this film, besides just penis cancer, if you can remember them (most are in Latin or otherwise studious)Check out the complete list of films on my      12 Days of Christmas Films List.",7,the-holdovers

Hopefully, this isn't an issue that will stay with me for long, but it's where I'm at right now. In case the rating didn't make it clear, this movie didn't grab me, and it quickly lost my attention.

I am still rather excited to see where the Apu Trilogy goes from here, especially since I know it follows the story of Apu from him as a child to him as an adult, and that's just the kind of concept for multi-film storytelling that I like. I admire most how it's a movie showing a family that is impoverished in a way that captures their harsh realities while not at all glorying it in any way. Every character interaction and relationship feels earnest while still structured. Indian cinema is still something that feels like a noticeable blind spot for me as a film-goer, and I like having a director like Satyajit Ray who have made several iconic films to help me see what I've been missing out on. Even if I can't fully click with the material, I admire the craft. This is actually my second Ray film, I saw The Music Room awhile ago, and I didn't love that movie either, but it's one I would recommend to others if they haven't seen it and want an interesting film from India.

It's Cinema Paradiso (1988) which encompasses everything I love about motion pictures themselves. I use it to connect with people, I use it to cry, to laugh, for nostalgia, for romance, for escaping and being transported into stories, for appreciating what's important in life. Cinema Paradiso goes beyond cinema itself, as I grow older, I appreciate movies not just for entertainment purposes but to reflect on many things in my life, important or not. In this movie, I connected more than many movies I have ever seen and it began as a connection between a child and man which created a bond so strong through the movies and blossomed into a father/son relationship.

77424,"One can't be happy without a family of one's own.Really liked this, close to four stars, might just up it to that later as I let the movie sink in a little more. A mother's love is something so rare and precious, and once it's gone, it's something you can't get back. Earlier had a really nice bit of shopping around town with my own mom, and it was great to be able to spend a little time with her. I love her a lot. I was surprised but found it very compelling that this is a feature that therefore belongs as much to Apu's mother as it does Apu himself. Both the teen Apu and his mother give great performances here, and I think the film as a whole looks rather stunning. Times change, people move on, and the young are left with whatever's left after their ancestors disappear to pick up the pieces and making something for themselves. Tale as old as time.7.5/10",6,aparajito
75502,"""Crazy for courage, and for what? How to die like a gentleman, how to die by the rules....when the only important thing is to live like a human being.""A sturdy, thoughtful anti-war film anchored by two powerful lead performances in the perfectly casted Guiness and especially Holden. It looks great, the Burmese jungle and the titular bridge both coming off appropriately majestic.It's also just too British - too much of its long long runtime showing too much deference to ideals like Following the Rules and Obeying Your Superiors which really should be absurd under these circumstances. Still good because those ideals do ultimately come crashing down in the end, but it takes a long time to get there and well, it's still all very British. No surprise Holden was my favorite part I suppose.",6,the-bridge-on-the-river-kwai
61998,"Worst film ever made. Seriously, you guys are fucking stupid for giving this absolute garbage such a high rating. “Errrm it’s experimental” 🤓. Okay, so if I make a movie of me masturbating on camera for 3 1/2 hours and called it “experimental” would you give that 5 stars too? So many annoying film nerds get so upset at me for thinking that this absolute garbage. “You just don’t get it” 🤓. Lol okay. There is nothing to understand. It’s just a miserable 3 1/2 hours of a woman doing chores. It’s boring enough when you have to do that in real life. Like how can you sit there and unironically think “wow, this was such a great movie! So much happened and I was entertained”. Get the fuck out of here.

The central romance between both Theron and Ricci is so beautifully built up but as it continues, it seems to fall into this repetitive trap it can't escape from. It never stops being totally engaging but there's a creative spark that the film peaks with in those first twenty minutes.",5,monster
83571,"[50]Tarkovsky plays Introspective Bartender here, whipping up a flummoxing cuvée of his past work, most notably SOLARIS, MIRROR, and STALKER (the staunch languidness, the amorphous structure, the probing philosophy). How you respond will be a direct correlation to how dry or dirty you like your martinis. Things are just too self-reflexive here -- too salvaged from his earlier work -- that it reeks of emulation, seeming more like someone trying too hard to BE Tarkovsky than Tarkovsky himself (one of cinema's biggest ironies). I felt the same e.g. about INLAND EMPIRE (viz. Lynch had his head so far up his own ass that the final product resembles something insincere and self-derivative) and while I enjoy NOSTALGIA more, it pales in comparison to Tarkovsky's other, earlier work. Everything here is coated in so much excess -- the long takes, the slow zooms, the meditative stills -- that the cloud of Tarkovsky's boundary pushing hangs drearily over the film's actual merits. Similar methods were used in SOLARIS, but the content of the frame was significant, and the camera's lingering nature encouraged excess scrutiny. Here, there's either nothing noteworthy or -- even worse -- some philosophically charged symbolicism that wants to bog everything down. Some of the set pieces are beautiful; the locations, breathtaking; the ambience, beguiling; the composition, meticulous. But I can't shake the notion that he's devolved into a B-rate version of his former self, constructing meaningless (albeit prepossessing) obstacles for his demoralized protagonist(s) to traipse through -- be it physical, mental, spiritual, or some combination -- lacquered in mysticism and cynicism, elapsing with such a grueling tempo that the entire experience becomes a rather soul-sucking affair, belabored and depleting. There was a precedence with STALKER; things were harmonious and, despite the still slow pace, sharply atoned. With STALKER, Tarkovsky chooses to double down several of his previously charted quirks; the result is clumsy, echoed superimposition, bringing new meaning to Subtraction by Addition.",4,nostalgia-1983

There’s some ingeniously observant, haunting, and surprising moments with brilliant sound design that made me cry but the style is so random and dare I say off-putting that it feels less like the life-like, anxiety-inducing experience it's supposed to represent and more like some quirky experimentation.My underwhelming impression might also be due to the fact that I pregamed this movie alone while having a couple beers and a glass of whiskey… And that is probably the saddest sentence I’ve ever written but also one of the highlights of my year.

4099,"Based on the amounts of violence and corruption of the youth shown in this film, I was horrified when the words “based on a true story” came up on screen at the end of the movie. I was in shock at the thought that the brutality shown in City of God was actually real. With further research, I found out that the events in the story were probably exaggerated to adapt well into the film format, so Li’l Ze probably wasn’t a real person. But I’m sure that there were plenty of people like Li’l Ze in this time, not only in Brazil, but around the world, using violence as a way to gain power.I’ve been seeing this movie at the top of “best female directed” lists along with normal “best of all time” lists for some time now, and I am glad that I finally watched it. I think that the Top 100 women directed list is really important and I want to see more of these films for sure. There is just a certain raw feeling to this film. It feels like the events of the film are in reality and that I am living through the same struggles in the city. This lifelike feeling to the film makes some of the scenes extremely difficult to watch, feeling like these events may have actually happened. One of the most important themes in the film in my opinion was showing the effects of children exposed to crime at such a young age. This was obviously most apparent in the case of Li’l Dice who started out just going along with others doing small robberies into killing everyone with ties to the drug trade to rise to the top. Seeing all this violence makes kid’s minds want to emulate this behavior later in life. We see this as a recurring cycle with the people who came before, then Li’l Dice, then the kids after Li’l Dice. There is no way for the city to change from this way as people will always be in search of power, and the groups are only getting more violent. There is no way for kids to otherwise get out of their poor situation in the City of God, causing them to support themselves any way they can. This acts as a larger critique of poverty. In such a bleak picture of the whole city, Rocket is a bright point. He is brought into illegal situations, but he never uses crime to his advantage. Even though he thinks about committing crimes, his morals take over and convince him not to do it. For doing this, he deserves to finally make it out of the city of god after all. Many people who don’t necessarily partake in crime aren’t as lucky as Rocket, as we see innocent people killed from violence within the city all the time. This goes to show the true randomness of ones chances to make it out of these circumstances all around the world because of the systems in place. City of God is a must watch, and deserves to be in the conversation among some of the greatest films of all time. There are truly some powerful messages of crime, exhibiting the nature of evil. This film can provide clarity on the reasons why evil people become the way that they are. Go watch this film! March 2021 ranked",8,city-of-god
5862,"The Runtime Condition starring my eyelids. I only say that because runtimes are relevant to experience, and this movie felt much longer than Lawrence of Arabia which we had done 2 weeks prior. I think this has the makings of a 9 hour epic, but not everything landed on my viewing of the first part.BUT as we talked about it on the show I did grow to like it more because there is a lot to unpack and digest. I think that takes time and I was not blown away on my viewing. I did not love the portrayal of Kaji -- I did not buy his ongoing naivete. Overall the film felt like it was trying to impress emotion on to the viewer rather than expressing emotion, but I am clearly in the minority here. I am also in the minority of thinking this was visually great, but not overwhelmingly amazing. A lot of really nice sets and outdoor shots but I was not blown away and I am not sure what everyone else is seeing. Will have to meditate on this more.

9744,"There is Daniel Day Lewis' performance, a standard which has become almost ludicrously normal for the man now. Paul Thomas Anderson's assured writing and direction instils an epic feel within the stripped down surroundings. Then there is the music. The score by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood will be the first thing that coats you with the thickness of the film’s black atmosphere. Greenwood's compositional skills have developed over the arc of Radiohead's career, pushed forward after the group dropped their guitars post ""OK Computer"". His haunting use of strings since then have become a prominent feature of some of their most memorable songs which comes into its own for this soundtrack. A blend of lonely pianos, aching strings and striking percussion that works perfectly in tangent with the shifting moods. This story of an empire built on the dirt, greed and bloody single mindedness can be addressed to either of its central concerns. The Texas Oil Boom made the state almost Depression-proof as profit soured higher than the gushing chemical it drilled for. Daniel Plainview is a salesman, a pragmatist and a politician, but most of all he is a businessman. He proclaims to hold family values above all else, in a time when kinship reflected your moral fibre. As the drill digs deeper and the pipeline expands, so does his distance away from humanity.Anderson creates an ambiguity around the identity of Paul and his brother Eli, leaving it for us to decide if they exist separately or as the same person. Either way the lineage of religions dependency on money, from the donations that have built the many grand elaborate Christian churches to the local orthodox collection box, is seen through the eyes of Eli. A young man with a growing flock casting unseen spirits out of the community, whilst the biggest devil stands right there before them.The moment where Daniel offers to purchase the Sunday's land brings about the first insight, the moment when the two men recognise each other. ""For my church"" Eli says in response to Daniels question as to why he needs $10,000. ""That's a good one"" he replies, the lingering look of understanding laying the groundwork for the context of their involvement with each other.The story is packed with complicated relationships and bloodlines between fathers, sons and brothers, that stands underneath the search for the precious commodity. H.W. is positioned by Daniels side declared as a nominal partner, almost like a conscience quietly perched on his shoulder. The young boy dressed in his suit carries a thoughtful look upon his face, one that shows the concern from all the things he has witnessed at Daniels side.As disgusting and vile as this oil man becomes there is also a feeling of pity that through succeeding against the odds he has become the man we leave at the end. America and capitalism has been built on an individualistic ideal, where the sky is the limit. Those that get there discover it can be a cold, lonely place. As a very famous oil man once said 'Blood is thicker than water but oil is thicker than both'.",9,there-will-be-blood

85183,"Had a rough time with almost all of the characters and the set-up took longer than I expected, although the ending puts things into a new perspective. It makes the acting, specifically Power's who does a lot of Acting, more tolerable in hindsight and explains the oddness of some people's actions. But I don't think this is as tightly plotted or smoothly told as many do. There are plot points that feel inauthentic which is the case with the humor and depiction of the legal procedural as well. That also hurts the character work that could be described as awfully one note compared to the revealed complexity of the ending and everyone's connection to each other. Witness for the Prosecution wants its characters to work as the vessels through which the film meditates on truth and machinations in/of the justice system, which form its most laudable aspects, but the characters don't get similar nuance to rival the bigger themes and therefore the film has little effect. I'm surprised I wasn't too impressed with the acting either since Laughton is usually pitch perfect in these roles (Spartacus, Advice and Consent) and Dietrich has self-awareness to pull of her sterotypical character in theory but something didn't work. Maybe its only the way she is treated by others in the film. I've felt less charmed by Wilder's classics lately than I previously did but he had a quite prolific career with a ton of quality pictures so I'm not yet concerned about being any less excited when one of his movies pops up on TV or anywhere else.Also, I'm going on a ski trip tomorrow so we'll see how active I am next week.

This movie clearly wants to be some grand anti war film but it also wants to be a magical adventure film too, and it doesn’t work as either when it feels like it’s trying to be more abstract than an actual narrative.

19777,"Mr Lyndon and his son wrapped in toilet paper.One of the best first acts of a movie, maybe ever. But one of the most dull, boring and bland middle acts of a movie ever. I am really annoyed about this because I really wanted to love this. Kubrick is my favourite director of all time, he has made some of the best movies of all time but this was not it at all. I just want too start of by saying that, the scenery and landscape shots in this movie are absolutely fuckin gorgeous, especially in the first act. It had such a pleasant feeling to it, and it worked for the time zone that they were in. I liked the rich dialogue from the characters, The costume designs were really nice and the camera work in certain sequences was shot very very well. Especially the fighting choreography. The themes of jealousy and wanting to become a man from Barry’s character was so good! I was loving it. I thought Barry’s character study throughout was pretty solid. You see how his character changes and starts affecting people around him. His overall growth was prettty damn good, but my fuckin god as soon as them 50 minutes were over, the movie had a huge drop. there was major problems with this movie. The girl who he meets for some food, felt like that was going to become a main focus in the movie but they just fuckin abandoned that. The entire middle act which was like an hour and 10 minutes, I will admit. And while it was still serving the main story, it felt extremely lazy. I didn’t like the wife and the sons that got introduced. I really didn’t like that. I didn’t feel any kind of connection towards that plot line in the slightest bit. Yes I get they were there for Barry’s character but they started focusing on the wife and the sons way too much, and I really didn’t care for it at all. There is a lot of extremely long sequences that were dragged on for unnecessary long. The scenery towards the middle act felt extremely distant compared to the first act. It felt like everything was pulling away and getting worse and worse as the film progressed. And then they tried making me feel sympathy for the son who was wrapped up in toilet paper and put in a coffin because he fell off a fuckin horse?! Really?!!!!! He was an annoying little brat the entire film I didn’t care about that.But like I said earlier on. This movie is a fuckin character study. And they are focusing on other characters as the film goes on which was a stupid direction to go for. I’ll give praise to the step son who grew up because he had a bit of an impact on Barry’s growth but apart from that, everybody else was fuckin boring!! U look at movies like clockwork orange which solely focus on the main character, because it’s a character study. If they did that with this movie, stayed with the continuity of the first act This could have been a whole lot better. Wasn’t a fan of that ending either to be honest, felt kind of overwhelming.But because of the first act alone, this overall isn’t terrible. Bad and overrated asf tho!2.5/5",4,barry-lyndon
51340,"This review refers to the 200min Director's Cut of the film.Here in Germany Das Boot has quite a  reputation. If you were to ask anyone of the older generation in my family, and that isn't exactly made up of lots of filmbuffs or anything of that sort, chances are they know about Das Boot. To my surprise my grandpa even has a copy of it on VHS.So it was about time  I finally watched this ominous film with my dad and wow, I'm just completely blown away.""So, what's it like down there, in a submarine?""I've read reviews about how people got bored and thought it dragged over its long runtime. I gotta disagree with that 100%. Despite having watched the almost 3.5 hour long directors cut, no film with a comparable runtime has ever managed to keep my engaged that much the whole time, it was just incredible how fast the time flew by. There's that fear, that steady and omnipresent atmosphere of danger that leaves you at the edge of your seat at all times even in the quieter moments.There's also the claustrophobic cinematography, which just traps you right in that submarine and clearly shows you how there's no way out of that tiny, sweaty tincan floating under the ocean in the middle of nowhere. Usually sound design isn't something that I notice being outstanding but in this case it plays a huge part in why the atmosphere works just so damn well. It just immerses you so well, shows you so threatingly that theres someone up there right above you desperately searching for you trying to blow you up or that theres just a thin metal wall between you and the immense pressure of the water trying to crush you. Of course I can't talk about Das Boot without mentioning the outstanding performances by all of the leads, it's just overall so perfectly acted. Paired with the awesome make-up the actors show you exactly how increasingly drained those men get with every passing second, mentally as well as physically. But the movie also reminds us every so often that those people that we root for  shouldn't be rooted for at all. Although the captain and most of other high ranking staff don't appear to be huge fans of their leadership in Berlin, they still fight under the Nazi flag. It still also means that a win for the crew is a win for Nazi Germany. After all though, these men are also just more of the Nazis victims. Young men, treated as replacable, sent to fight, suffer and die in a war initiated by a monster.""All for the Fatherland."" Oh God, all just empty words.

In fact, I almost immediately placed an order for it.  Before I did, though, I read Roger Ebert's review who listed it as one of the Great Movies ... and yet I hesitated.So, I was extremely pleased that Criterion Channel added it to the streaming offerings.  In great anticipation, I settled down today to watch it.Hmmm.As the end credits arrived, my mind imagined a University offering an MFA in Cinema Degree that consisted only of watching, staying engaged, and analyzing WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES.  Those who did so successfully received their Degree.  Everyone else received a one year subscription to the MAX streaming service.It seems I'd be adding MAX to my channels.I have never, ever worked so hard to make my way through to the end of a movie.  My preference in film-watching is for a strong story combined with multiple-dimensional characters.  It is fine if the movie is deeply philosophical, abstract or even metaphorical.  Technical virtuosity is a plus.  But, at the core, I need a solid base of an engaging story with characters I want to discover more about.In the case of WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES, I found that I had to force my curiosity into play ... constantly.  Granted, there were plenty of moments for doing so.  (The first visit to the whale was particularly awe-inducing.)  Yet, there was a moment when the central character ladled out a bowl of soup, broke pieces of bread into it, and the first thought that crossed my mind was, ""Are we going to watch him eat his entire dinner?""  (We didn't.  He had a visitor arrive.  However, there were plenty of other scenes in which simple actions were played out in their entirety.)It wasn't until about 105-minutes into the film that I didn't have to work at maintaining my focus.  And the final 40-minutes had some truly amazing moments, the last scene of which I doubt that I'll ever forget.But, I'm not going to pretend that I ""get it.""I'm thinking that the best thing I can do is just to accept the label of an ""Intellectual Cinema Neophyte"" and shamefully buy my ticket for the next MARVEL tent-pole film.

49519,"Fucking obnoxious. The fact that this is getting such glowing reviews makes me feel like it’s a fucking Psy-Op. Maybe it is, maybe this is the first step in the Russo Bros. monopolizing A24 in the glorious name of Marvel. This definitely feels like a Marvel movie, stupid quips and all, but it seems to be even more heinous than your typical Marvel movie. I’m 100% certain I hated 99% of this movie. The only thing I’m unsure of is whether I hated it more than I hated Don’t Look Up.The overly caffeinated, excessively beating heart of this movie is the belief in “optimistic nihilism,” which is just an oxymoron at best. It’s just buzzwords, there’s no substance to it. This movie is “baby’s first brush with nihilism.” It’s a stupid concept (Marvel-style multiverses) trying to appear smart by association with a grander concept (nihilism). At worst, it’s a cynical push toward an ideology that encourages complacency in the face of existential dread and meaninglessness. Yeah, this world is meaningless, and we’re all just stupid, insignificant specks of shit, but that’s really underselling and undervaluing the human experience isn’t it? And to suggest that there is nothing anyone can do to overcome that feeling of dread is fucking sickening. The movie’s response to normal feelings of dread, depression, or trauma is to just be quirky! “Just be a rock!” Just be kind. But don’t do anything within your power to enhance your lot in life! Maybe this movie is just good at pulling the wool over the eyes of the audience but how the fuck is anyone supposed to view this thing and feel like it’s actually life-affirming?The faux-ideologies aside, it’s a dogshit movie from every other way you look at it. There’s no meaningful character development, no one changes for the better, no one really learns anything. In an episode of It’s Always Sunny, that’s usually fine and entertaining because they’re awful people you aren’t supposed to sympathize with them. In this, you’re supposed to sympathize with this family and be invested in their problems though. The father wants to divorce the mother? Feels forced and against character. They’re getting audited by the IRS? Yawn. Mother is homophobic and abusive to her gay daughter? There is no satisfying growth or resolution to this! Near the end of the film she calls her daughter fat and says she’s still upset about her dating women. But don’t worry, it’s okay! They embrace and say they love each other because nothing matters I guess? It’s a stretch to call it acceptance but I struggle even to say the mother displays tolerance at the bare minimum.It’s really cruel and a insanely racist at times in its characterization. Evelyn is told that she’s the worst version of herself throughout all of the multiverses like it’s supposed to be positive??? It feels like negging but it’s treated as a sincere indicator of her specialness. What’s special about her being painted as a stereotypical Asian “tiger mom” that pushes her daughter too hard? Her father is an old traditional Chinese man who is disappointed in having a daughter because the movie apparently needed some outdated one-child policy propagandizing. The dad is a child-like emasculated goofball who wears a fanny pack. The lesbian daughter plays the role of the villain in the multiverses. The family fits the Chinese laundry worker stereotype. There’s a Jewish character they call “Big Nose.” For good measure they underdeveloped the daughter’s  girlfriend and included such a tacked-on-there lesbian romance between the mom and the IRS agent. God, I wish it stopped there.The humor is proof that early 2010’s “Le epic-bacon” culture is resurgent. I felt like I was going crazy sitting in the theater hearing everyone laugh at the stupid random bullshit they kept throwing out. Wow, they’re fighting with dildos! Lmao, the IRS awards look like butt plugs and they’re fighting to stick them up their ass! OMG, they’re in a universe where their fingers are hot dogs! HOOOLY SHIT, the mother and daughter are having a heart to heart while they’re in a universe where they’re rocks! 😲 Gimme a fuckin’ break! It’s all such soyface inducing bullshit. It’s silly humor for media illiterate adults that think like children. Any chance of this movie having a tender moment or a consistent tone is shafted by the stupidest bullshit.Nothing fucking matters, but this movie ESPECIALLY does not matter in the slightest bit. It’s not art, it’s a cynical piece of media trying to pass itself off as quirky, life-affirming comedy. Don’t buy into it. There’s countless other works of art that might give you a healthy dose of meaning in your life, but Everything Everywhere At Once sure as shit ain’t it.",0,everything-everywhere-all-at-once

87018,"Wenders, in uber-relaxed mode, seems almost at pains to suck the drama out of Perfect Days. It begins with a dawn routine in the half-light gradually revealing the mundane if exacting life of a contented toilet cleaner, Hirayama, played by the great Komi Yakusho (Cure, Charisma, Eureka, etc). Hirayama could be an ex-angel, from Wings of Desire, such is his beneficent outlook on the world, but Perfect Days is comparatively anodyne stuff, with the barest of plots, only hints of character depth and no real development, and an over-reliance on sentimentality to fill in the gaps. Technically, as always with Wenders, it’s a joy to look at, with his visual fluidity to the fore. Uncharacteristically, though, his music choices leave a lot to be desired, tipping into some seriously hackneyed territory. The film’s gentle comedy works only slightly better, wasting the opportunity for some good toilet humour, with something altogether more twee. I didn’t smile, let alone laugh once. And my lack of mirth was not helped by the fact I was sitting directly in front of a woman with a pickaxe laugh who’d shattered my skull by the end of the film.  The advance notices of this were mostly positive, however, there were notable dissenters who saw this as further proof of Wenders decline as a narrative filmmaker. I hoped they were wrong, but this manages somehow to be both inconsequential and laboured. Komi Yakusho gives a likeable performance, but he needs more to work with. Ultimately, the best I can say for Perfect Days is it’s a fine showcase for Tokyo’s interesting toilet architecture. Wim Wenders",4,perfect-days-2023

Right off the bat, Bird's masterpiece it's worth of praise for being a kids movie, therotically at least, that could make Truffaut scrath his head.Blatantly and charmingly references the relevant pictures from the era in which the story is set and unprecedently(?) clashes the highly characteristic genre with a totally awesome version of the kid-and-pet familair structure. The fantastic design of the characters stupefyingly matches this daring premise.The ending is predictable from the get-go, but the mysterious gigantic war machine doesn't disappoint in delivering an emotional closure to the conflict.

59303,"I don’t know at what point exactly in my life that I started to realize how lonely and distant I’ve become, but it wasn’t much later that I also started to feel like I’d engaged in some kind of irreversible process of removing myself from the world around me. Cloistering so deeply into myself that I simply started to cease existing in the same manner in which everyone around me seemed to be existing: freely and openly. Or maybe it seemed more like they lived intrepidly and presently, while I was floating just behind, always feeling a step behind in the grand plot of things. It began to feel like I was living in a complicated play and started to realize halfway through that I was a bad actor and didn’t know the script half as well as everyone else. I was missing my marks and getting discouraged and feeling intimidated because of my lack of talent. Maybe that it felt more like I’d wandered onto the set of the wrong movie and was constantly fumbling to improv my way through every scene would be a better way to describe the lost and flailing-on-the-edge-of-panic feeling that started seeping into my soul, sopping it up and dissolving it like bread in a bowl of vinegar. Whatever sort of label or explanation I try to tack onto it to express the feeling sounds self-pitying and desperate, but does nothing to detract from how debilitating it has become. Has. Is. And I’m not getting any better at acting so I don’t know how much longer I can keep fooling everyone into thinking that I know what I’m fucking doing. I just don’t know how to engage anymore. I don’t know how to be present and available anymore. Just when I think I’m getting close with people I get cold feet and slip away. I’m afraid of emotional fallout or consequences or being open and vulnerable. Something. I don’t know why or what, but it’s left me lonely and nihilistic.

This deals with common themes, and links directly into Tokyo Story, but does so deftly.This could have so easily been a more crude example of ‘the young mistreat the old and isn’t that sad’. What it is instead is broader portrait of our flaws and divides, how our lives don’t coalesce and how we can do each other pain. The film is critical of all and sympathetic to all - and ultimately shows how certain social systems restrict us greatly.It is a touching, if overly formal and restrained, picture that uses a brief runtime to create poetry. It is a film about wanting more and so often being dissatisfied, about not making the most of the time you had.

85559,"[47]Every year has its token Foreign Film for People Who Don’t Normally Watch Foreign Films e.g. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, CITY OF GOD, OLDBOY, THE INTOUCHABLES, ROMA, etc. (Pick any year - it’ll have one.) As commendable—and necessary—as these movies are for greasing the skids into the gaping abyss of cinema beyond one’s traditional comfort zone, they’re often blemished by touchpoint comforts and familiarities, overly manufactured drama, predictably flat narrative arcs, and/or boring one-note characters - safety nets guarding the canyon below the non-English exterior. THE HUNT suffers from each of those things to some degree, but its most fatal flaw is how Vinterberg divorces the humans from their natural ability to think critically and use common sense, chalking up ill-considered decisions to contagious emotional trauma,  thereby producing something that reads as a weirdly-tinted text on the hysterical overreaction of women amid potentially tragic but not-yet-proven incidents. Yes, some of the men show volatility toward Lucas (e.g. the butcher) but women are always at the helm of the “big” decisions and determinative junctures, dictating the wildfire spread of communal contempt against him. At one point, Klara literally says to her mother, ”He did nothing wrong, I just said something foolish,” and the mother, without missing a beat, essentially reassures her that it did happen, and that she was touched. Understandably, any parent with the notion that their child fell into the hands of a sexual predator would be on high alert, but this conversation is preceded by a wishy-washy meeting with Klara, her parents, and a therapist, wherein the little girl spouts off a variety of conflicting non-facts and vague descriptors of what supposedly happened. It is also alluded to, on more than one occasion, that Klara “has a wild imagination” and, as witnessed, is incapable of producing a single recollection that would indict Lucas, specifically, in lieu of any other middle-aged man in the town. For something with such irreversible implications, surely more scrutiny would be applied, especially coupled with Klara’s consistent uncertainty and Lucas’s generally good standing with the tightly knit townsfolk. Instead, Vinterberg grabs the steering wheel and careens off that cause-and-effect cliff, his film transitioning into a scrapbook of the community’s vilification and mistreatment of Lucas until he inevitably snaps and the tension steadily evaporates thereafter - or does it? *Bum bum bummmmm* Kinda lame.And I get it. It’s supposed to be a cautionary tale about the dangers of false accusations and how reputations tarnished in the process will remain that way forever, as evidenced by the closing moments. As an underscored pseudo-horror about mob mentality, it nearly works. But it’s too icy and calculated to ignite the gargantuan heap of emotional gunpowder it piles up, and too many careless, nonsensical decisions by otherwise intelligent human beings prevent the story from feeling like the unavoidable hellscape it increasingly imposes. (Lucas struck me as the type of guy who would’ve had the wherewithal to immediately notify e.g. the main caretaker at the nursery of Klara’s initial kiss, thereby protecting himself and making the girl’s precocious sense of intimacy known to at least one other adult.) De facto filmmaking at its finest; if not for a knockout performance from Mikkelsen, this would’ve been a lot more punishing.",4,the-hunt-2012
22730,"After how excited I was to finally get around to watching this film, I was disappointed to find myself struggling to connect with its story. Once again I find myself frustrated with how my expectations for a specific movie set a precedent which the film never lives up to. I find myself wanting to watch more and more films that aren’t so well received to spare myself from the ultimate disappointment of watching films within the letterboxd top 250. With most of the widely acclaimed films I’ve seen recently, The Handmaiden, Spirited Away and 8 1/2 to name a few, I have felt like I simply “didn’t get” the film, and gave them 4 star ratings and called it a day. These films are not living up to my expectations, and it is frustrating. I have tried to avoid reading any reviews or having and previous knowledge of the film beforehand, but that average letterboxd rating says enough for me to make an assumption about the film before it has even started. I love film, but I find that there are few films that truly feel special to me. I feel that the deeper I get into the journey of watching films, the more disappointment it will be filled with. Even when I rate something 5 stars, I don’t even feel emotionally fulfilled most of the time. I enjoy these films from a filmmaking aspect, but not on an emotional level. I can feel myself losing some of that joy that I used to feel from watching movies and reviewing them. Every two months or so I go into brief periods of feeling burnt out, and I may be beginning one of those cycles right now. I’m not going to commit to a break from films right now, but I feel that it may be necessary for me. It is unclear to me whether It’s Such a Beautiful Day is what brought these feeling to my attention, or if it was a gradual decline, but this movie was certainly powerful and capable of making me feel these emotions, and yet I still found myself not fully enjoying the experience. Even before going into this film, I was a huge fan of Don Hertzfeldt's animation style. I found the minimalist drawings in World of Tomorrow to be superb, and even assist in driving home its existentialist themes. But the black and white animation of It’s Such a Beautiful Day simply hindered my ability to fully grasp Hertzfeldt’s themes and story. As I said, I am a huge fan of his work as an artist, but this style didn’t translate well in my mind. I think that World of Tomorrow is more successful in carrying out its themes, which are more profound, and doing so in only 17 minutes. I found the scale of World of Tomorrow to be impressive, bringing in futuristic aspects, and I found It’s Such a Beautiful Day to be a bit too mundane for my taste. World of Tomorrow deals with death in a much more accessible way, having narration from a little kid who is brought into the future, which lightens the mood often. Mundanity, like anything else, can be done right, but Hertzfeldt’s approach was everything but cinematic. I found the philosophical ramblings of the narrator during the first half of the film to be slightly forced, and didn’t flow nicely with the film. I did, however, enjoy the film showing Bill’s new perspective on life after being guaranteed a death sentence. Sometimes, the thing that it takes to make sense of your life, is death. This section of the film shows the beauty of life, and how without death, there is no life. Through Bill’s surreal dream sequences, we contrast his real life and his perceived world in his dreams. The surrealism compliments the largely nihilistic tone of the first two chapters of this film perfectly, spotlighting the true mundanity of an uneventful life such as Bill’s. Despite its short runtime, this film is nowhere near an easy watch. You will be constantly challenged by its deep existential themes and both extreme realism and surrealism. Don’t watch this movie if you’re just looking for something with a short runtime. May 2021 ranked",6,its-such-a-beautiful-day

Turns out I'm now certain that I'd never even seen Heat, always confusing it with Stick and Malone. Those latter two I've seen countless times. But Heat? Nope, this was my first ever viewing.The two films, working from the same script by the novel's author William Goldman, are indeed very similar with only some minor technical and character differences along the way. The fights are better in Wild Card, not that they're bad here but the Statham action is more my speed these days. Also, the character of Cyrus Kinnick (played here by Peter MacNicol) gets a much better resolution than in Wild Card.However in this one, Burt javelins a man into an electrical panel and sets another man on fire by kicking a light bulb.

As everyone has already stated, Giulietta Masina's performance is marvelous. From the moment we first meet her character you're on her side. Yeah, she might be a bit naive. But her heart is in the right place, she's tough, and her little dance numbers will put a smile on your face :)The script was co-written by Pier Paolo Pasolini, another one of the Italian greats whose work I desperately need to discover. People note that his influence can be felt in this film. I cannot comment on that because, as I said, I'm not familiar with his movies ... yet.I also loved the locations.

70027,"89/100Show me a dog-lover who doesn't immediately sympathise with the friendship between Umberto and Flike, and I'll show you a dog-lover who actually bought a cat by mistake. As I write this review, my own pet canine, sits on the floor behind me, staring upwards with intelligent, brown eyes, and we share a connection and an understanding that really is rather difficult to translate into words. Italian director Vittorio De Sica evidently also understood the bond between man and dog, and this touching relationship forms the centrepiece of Umberto D. arguably the final major film in the Italian neo-realism movement that was established in the mid-1940s. though initially unsuccessful in its home country, has come to be considered one of the foremost examples of the distinctive Italian film-making style.As was typical for neo-realism films, the title role was played by a non-professional actor, Carlo Battisti, a retired professor of linguistic science. Considering that Umberto D. was his sole film appearance, Battisti gives an incredibly sincere performance, his dreary, downcast eyes betraying a lifetime of fruitless existence. Umberto Domenico Ferrari, having completed a mildly successful career in public service, wishes for nothing more than to live out his remaining years in peace and security, but the minuscule government pension doesn't afford him many luxuries; his debts with the wealthy, heartless landlord are regularly compounding, and so Umberto struggles to feed himself, let alone his faithful canine companion, Flike (occasionally translated as Flag; played by animal actor Napoleone). Though he occasionally comes across some wealthier friends from his younger days, Umberto has too much dignity to ask them for money, and his half-hearted attempts at begging result in some genuine Chaplin-esquire flourishes of humour (a characteristic that sets Umberto D. apart from many other absolute works of neo-realism). Indeed, aside from the ever-enthusiastic Flike, Umberto's only other avenue for friendship comes from the young maid in his apartment building, Maria, who is currently pregnant, but cannot decide which of her two boyfriends is the father.All things considered, not very much happens in 'Umberto D.,' but it is the hapless plight of the title character that keeps us dutifully watching, for his eventual fate is continually shrouded in uncertainty. When all security and dignity has been stripped from him, Umberto decides that it is time for him to die, but his love for Flike prevents him from taking an drastic measures, for the greatest tragedy imaginable is a loyal dog without the care of his master. The ending of the film, after Flike fearfully thwarts Umberto's attempts at a noble murder-suicide (the shot of the train roaring past Umberto, heaving a cloud of dirt about him, is absolutely incredible), is something that would not have looked out of place in a Charles Chaplin film. Having returned to each other's arms, Umberto and Flike descend down the road, playing amongst themselves, their futures uncertain, both hopeful and bleak. Where are they going? What will they do now? Will they survive? More than half a century later, we're still asking these questions.",7,umberto-d
64304,"Best Actress Winners Finished (Complete Ranking)Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a gruesome depiction of a violent and extreme marriage that plays with the concepts of reality and illusion. The direction and cinematography were fantastic, with the perfect blend of close-ups, long takes, and handheld work. Perhaps the most artistic aspect is the camera's tendency to flit in and out of focus in order to recreate the drunken stupor that pervades the film. The story itself is both frightening and strangely amusing. This is the epitome of tragic comedy. Each character's public fascades are destroyed, and their private fears and anxieties are revealed. Burton's final act was cruel and spiteful, and it was, but it was also the closest he could get to a genuine act of kindness. Every character in this is enigmatic, but the crowning glory goes to Dame Elizabeth Taylor as Martha, a crude and slew wise cracking but ruthless woman. Liz Taylor who was considered the most beautiful woman in the world at the time, surprised many when she played the vulgar, frumpy, fifty-year-old Martha, for whom she had gained 13 kilos. Her physical transformation into aging harpy Martha is impressive enough, but her performance seizes to channel the force and fury of a hurricane. Taylor exemplifies film acting at it's very best, as it alternates between being hilarious, vexing, and in the end, exhausted and defeated. She comes across as comically frustrated with life as she torments George. Liz Taylor demonstrates a side of her acting abilities that differs from the usual cute young beauty that we see her in. To sum this all up in just 10 words: Liz delivers one of the greatest performances of all time. Richard Burton's performance as George, her co-star, is also noteworthy. Liz and Burton simply mold into the roles of an aging couple who rely on childish games and bullying to get by in their warped view of marriage. But Richard Burton is uncanny as George, he inhibited the character's heart and soul rather than simply playing it. He is darkly and hauntingly complex. He and Liz deliver makes viewers feel as uneasy as the young guests on the screen. George Segal and Sandy Dennis also delivered outstanding performances as the perplexed, beleaguered young couple caught in the crossfire of the two bitter, older couples. The uneasiness and discomfort that Segal and Dennis shows is very unnerving yet so convincing, a testiment to what a phenomenon the two were in this film. Overall, ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is a master class in screen acting with unobtrusive, complementary directorial strokes. Having no music, thrills, or glitz, makes the effect much more genuine. Grade: A+🔙WandaVision",9,whos-afraid-of-virginia-woolf

86553,"I was thoroughly engaged by most of this. It’s such a composed yet daring film from a filmmaker so young. Xavier Dolan’s Mommy messes around with aspect ratio and the most offbeat of soundtracks, purposefully blending indie jams with mainstream anthems. The film is simply too long and the ending, while cool to look at, feels incomplete. The film is as raw as Fish Tank at times, which also deals with the single mother struggle, though Mommy’s mommy isn’t negligent but rather exhausted, with a loving son who’s perhaps too rowdy to ever be fully cured. Dolan doesn’t hold back, making our young co-lead a racist, sexist and immature prick whenever he does lash out, and the lack of improvement of his condition or his relationship with his mother is a strength of the film. It aims to find beauty in an upsetting life, never deceiving the viewer into thinking their situation will drastically improved, instead small steps is the answer. The three leads make this film work, their chemistry is authentic and non showy, even in the more dramatic scenes. Dolan does manipulate us emotionally at times, and it dips into melodrama as well as repetitive narrative, but the end result is gripping and impressive.

It's a strange premise but it's also alluring.The sand dune that engulfs & entraps them plays like a forbidding character in itself and its slipping & slithering is ingeniously captured by the sharp camerawork. Editing could've been better, for the glacial pace & overlong runtime make their presence felt in the remaining half. Eiji Okada & Kyōko Kishida play the doomed couple in the isolated hut and both contribute in with deftly layered performances.Overall, Woman in the Dunes isn't a film that's going to appease every palate out there, for it is slow, frustrating & often alienating, and the avant-garde treatment won't strike a chord with everyone.

A towering feat of cinematic tedium that arguably has no equals, this avant-garde surrealist comedy-drama turned out to be exactly what I presumed it would be: too far up its own ass.Co-written & directed by Federico Fellini, 8½ concerns a famous filmmaker who no longer remembers the film he wanted to make. The idea came from Fellini's own creative block during production and through all the agony he underwent, he decided to make a picture that captures the similar frustrations so that the audience can suffer just as much as he did.On a serious note though, the film does acquaint the viewers to an extent with the struggles of creating art and the personal sacrifices that the process demands. It's an exhibition of what a director's job actually looks like and how regardless of their professional & personal issues, they are expected to deliver. It is aimless & convoluted like the film within the film coz it is the film within the film.Overall, 8½ is a tedious, overlong & self-indulgent exercise that left me indifferent to everything it had in store and while I see the brilliance of its metafictional construction, the drama remains uninteresting and is filled with characters who are downright annoying & unlikeable.

As an anti-samurai samurai movie, it provides a unique perspective to the usually action-oriented genre, and pokes into some heavy themes both politically and socially, but for me, the storytelling is far from perfection, which prevents this from true greatness.The unevenness of Harakiri is what strikes me the most. This is a suspenseful drama for the first half that plays around its mysteries with style and entertainment values. Tatsuya Nakadai was impeccable as a mysterious guest to a clan estate who demanded a harakiri. Unfortunately, the second half in comparison feels like a giant disappointment when large chunks of overlong flashback scenes completely throw off any good momentum. One could argue that the style and technical aspects of Harakiri are second to none, but as someone who has seen the absolute highs from Kenji Mizoguchi and Akira Kurosawa, Harakiri is just not nearly on the same level. Still an important movie though.",6,harakiri
68373,"It felt like every scene was on the brink of leading us somewhere truly great... and then it ends. Scorsese's direction elevated a lot of things that might seem standard in a script, but at the same time, failed to emphasize on a lot of the thematic power and subtext. What is here is still good though. There's a cautionary tale here about male insecurity and how it's a fuel as well as a carcinogen; It might help you push forward, but only for a moment, before the inevitable fall. And It is fascinating watching Scorsese work in this expressionistic hyper-stylized mode, especially in those boxing fights and how they look less like concrete events and more like tortured dreams happening inside Jake LaMotta's mind.Still, I found the film too happy to sit back and just play Jake LaMotta's life reel without getting involved. We follow him for 15 years, but it felt like 5 months. Lot of scenes felt repetitive, or happened without deep emphasis, like the whole mafia angle is very prominent, then he just allows them to get involved out of nowhere, and after that... nothing else, completely forgotten.Not to mention all the digusting things LaMotta did that are just sort of looked over. People don't like how the female characters are depicted, but Jake LaMotta himself is a one-note monster, who drags his knuckles through the narrative, learning nothing and doing nothing other than to repel us with his behavior.It's a good movie, but a lot of people are forgiving Scorsese's huge storytelling shortfalls here.Sidenote: I like how when De Niro says ""let me ask you man to man, does that girl look 14?"" and it cuts to an insert of the girl's photos like Scrosese is trying to plead with us ""come on, give LaMotta a break here!"" looool like why the hell are you asking me, i don't wanna be involved in this mess, no thank you.",5,raging-bull

The premise and major plot points are more or less the same and still as exciting as in the original. Four men, who for different reasons all try to start a new life in a small South American town, volunteer to transport unstable nitroglycerin in two trucks through the jungle to an exploded oil well. The first hour of the film is used for setup and character introduction (which is well executed) and the second hour shows the nerve-wrecking journey through the jungle. Friedkin creates a bleak world with fucked up characters doing fucked up things. The direction is brilliant, the set pieces are magnificent, the visuals are stunning, and the atmosphere is extremely tense and thrilling. The four leads have an engaging dynamic and deliver strong performances, Roy Scheider and Bruno Cremer being the standouts.All in all, I enjoyed “Sorcerer” even more than “The Wages of Fear”, though it´s close.",7,sorcerer

Then, set up an alibi with a beautiful woman and arrange to sit in on a poker game. Be sure to wear gloves. Enter a supper club called Martley's and shoot the owner in his own office. See if you can avoid being spotted by witnesses. After leaving, toss the gun in the Seine River, make sure someone sees you leaving the alibi woman's apartment, ditch the stolen car, take a cab to the card game, and don't flinch when you are arrested anyway.Alain Delon is the hired killer, Jef Costello. The alibi woman is Jane Lagrange played by Nathalie Delon, and the investigating detective, Le Commissaire, is François Périer. There's is no way the police can put Costello at the murder scene, but there is one aspect of the crime he didn't take into his calculations -- a double-cross by the people who hired him.Even as the police set up a net to ensnare Le Samouraï, he gets a bit of help from Martley's pianist (Cathy Rosier) in locating those who have betrayed him. There's a bit of cat and mouse as a chase ensues through the Paris Metro system. Eventually, everything is settled in what I've come to believe is the key hallmark of the French New Wave -- the shooting death of a key character.

47441,"So I don’t know if this is just me with an opinion in the minority, but it does kinda seem like some people have been guilted into pretending to like this movie 🤷‍♂️I’m just gonna r/whoosh myself though because I was thoroughly confused 100% of the time. Especially after Jack dies and Mandrake guesses the codes so the planes can be recalled, I pulled up the screenplay to read along with the rest of the movie because I was so confused. I definitely feel like I missed out on a big joke, because I can tell it’s a satire but I had no idea where/when to laugh. Kong riding missile was obviously supposed to be funny, but I don’t even know if the “you’re gonna have to answer to the coca-cola company” “the string in my leg’s GONE!” or the “you can’t fight in here, this is the WAR ROOM” were supposed to be one-liners? Regardless nothing resulted in me laughing but more of a wtf/seriously????? reaction. Not that I think this needs to be funny to work, as I don’t think films need to fall into the genre they are billed as (i.e. I love Midsommar for being a thriller and don’t understand the criticism of it ‘not being scary horror movie’), but I just don’t feel like it accomplished anything narratively in a coherent fashion. The off-beat tone of everything zapped the suspense for me (if suspense was even intended, maybe the plane stuff was supposed to be slapstick-y?). In terms of plot, it’s razor-thin...not much happens for a 90 minute film that takes place over the course of 90 minutes. Which I wouldn’t mind because I enjoy ‘plotless’ movies, but the screentime was allocated so oddly that it made it difficult to get invested in any character, plus we’re not given much insight into their motivations. They serve as caricatures more than characters, which maybe is the point but idk, I just can’t decipher what to take out of this film. It’s ultimately a miss for me, idek why i’m justifying any of this lolFINALLY, from the time Strangelove starts tweaking to the closing shot has to be one of the most bizarre finales in cinematic history...me: “did he just address the president as ‘mein fuhrer’?” strangelove: “MEIN FUHRER, I CAN WA—“ 💣💣💣💣💣💣💣 what the fuck 😂",3,dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb

Offbeat film feels like an Elmore Leonard knockoff (it's actually based on a book by William Goldman, and functions more successfully as a character study than an out and out action film. The proceedings are helped immeasurably by a good supporting cast which includes Howard Hesseman and Peter MacNicol who are both great. Reynolds is too. He gives a really interesting performance Probably better than the film deserves. Biggest issue with this one is the strange shifts in tone from comedy to violent action, to melodrama and some poorly staged action that includes a ridiculous use of slow motion. Even still I found myself weirdly engaged with this one even while acknowledging that it's not a particularly well made film. I found the world the Burt Reynolds character inhabits intriguing and the relationships he has with a number of quirky supporting players fascinating enough to make this film worthwhile.",5,heat
76017,"""I feel seen,"" is a phrase I see a lot online. It's one I myself have said a lot online. The beautiful thing about film/music/art/etc is that it allows someone to communicate an extremely specific experience or situation to tap into a universal truth about life, and the best thing as an audience member is when that universal truth seems to be speaking directly to your personal struggles, many of which are so hyper-personal that we don't even talk about them with our closest friends and family.Something I don't think I've seen talked about is determining the line between art that makes you ""feel seen"" and art that triggers you. Being a complete idiot, I watched this movie without looking up potential triggers that are deeply deeply difficult for me to handle for personal reasons you all can probably imply from all my beating-around-the-bush talk about depression, although in some cases it's not necessarily personal but that already feels like a little too much information for the internet, now doesn't it?  Regardless, I like to think that my triggers are ""big"" enough that they're pretty easy to suss out from the synopsis, of just the general conversation around a film. It's pretty easy to avoid because normally it's front and center in the movie, because, you know, they're hefty enough themes as it is, aren't they? Bad habit to not check myself, dumb habit to not check myself, but I'm willing to bet that most of us, despite all having some triggers, rarely if ever check beforehand. Because it's not human nature to mentally prepare for things unless it's pretty obvious that you're going to have to mentally prepare for something. So I watched Mary and Max, a film that is not entirely about depression that also doesn't see depression as really the central thematic focus of the film, but is nonetheless about depression. Last night I was in a pretty healthy and happy frame of mind (shout out to Kiki's Delivery Service for establishing that), but even when I felt relatively safe, I kept getting a nagging sense that I was not really ""enjoying"" how Mary and Max was handling the depression elements.In the 2000s, there were a lot of seminal films that meant a lot to a lot of people that tended to be written off by general audiences as ~quirky indie fodder~ that also dealt either explicitly or implicitly with the topic of depression. Films like Garden State and Little Miss Sunshine and etc etc you know the exact subgenre I'm talking about. Pitchfork-core soundtracks, gallows humor from the mouth of someone who had no reason to be making those jokes, privileged and white, with cinematography that was pretty in the way a scenic Polaroid of the highway you take on a road  trip is pretty. Some of these movies are great, some of them I go back and forth on, and some of them I really dislike. The ones I dislike are the ones that typically made mental health issues out to be a personality trait to be embraced. I hate it for the same reason I hate want-to-be writers who romanticize their mental health and addiction issues as the mark of a great artist. I hate it in the same way I hate whenever someone sends me a depression meme. I always hated it, but in the 2000s I was a kid and I didn't really know why I hated it. But I'm not a kid in 2020, and watching Mary and Max, it reeked of that latter category of 2000s indie films that equate mental health struggles with quirks that should be lovely embraced. I don't want it to be embraced, not only because it's not who I actually am 99.9% of the time, but because embracing it will allow it to win. I don't want people I love dearly to embrace it because then they'll suffer. I want us all to learn to cope with it, I want us all to learn how to deal with it in a healthy way when it comes up, and I want us all to be able to willingly talk about it not as some taboo, but as a simple fact of life, like having a nut allergy instead of like having a terminal illness. Mary and Max doesn't want these things, because it wants us to say, ""This is who I am as a person,"" even though no mental illness is the defining trait of that person. Sure, maybe they talk about it a lot [exhibit A], but that's only because it's something that you probably have to talk a lot about because society is still figuring out how to deal with it. I honestly talk about my mental health in the same way and to the same degree that I talk about my allergies. It's not some ~big deal~ but it's just something that happens to be there. But this film says it is a big deal, and since it's always going to be at the forefront of your mind, you might as well just make it define you, because you're going to be talking about it so much that that's how people will define you.But then there's other aspect about this movie - aspects that I think the film would argue are the central focus - that it seems like a lot of people relate to, because it makes them feel seen. Hell, even when it comes to the elements I'm critiquing, I think there's probably a large segment who would say that my take is wrong because they feel seen. And if that's how you feel, even the most legitimate critique cannot and should not take that validity away from you.That, however, is why I'm having such a hard time with this film. I could list a bunch of elements I don't think really 'work' on the basis of objective craft, from the color palette to the claymation that blends together because of the monochromatic color palette to the quirky jokes to the quirky ukulele soundtrack to the voice-over narration to the rather flat character development to the rejection of a narrative that rises in exchange for one that stays fairly static for most of the film until a big, trigger-inducing climax comes out of absolutely nowhere and makes little sense because there hasn't really been enough character development to warrant that sudden pivot that feels unearned and mostly there for shock and the illusion of depth...but notice how all these elements just go back to a direct hatred for art that says ""your mental health struggles are what make you a star!""? This type of film has flaws, sure, and Mary and Max has all those flaws in spades, sure, but what I'm rejecting here isn't those flawed elements, but rather the type of film this is point blank. I reject it because it doesn't ""make me feel seen,"" because it doesn't actually want to see me. These types of films want to see one element of me and people I love dearly, and they decided that the element they'd focus the most on was the one that has no defining influence on me as a person, and then it goes back to the studio and insists on making a film where those elements are the sole defining elements of their characters. For a lot of people, especially people who do feel like their mental health is so overbearing that the world does tend to only see their mental health, films like this probably do make them feel seen. Again, that is beyond valid, and I don't want to give the impression that I think anyone who felt like this film spoke to them is inherently wrong, because that experience is one side of the experience. I, however, didn't feel seen, because there's another side of the experience that feels outright neglected and dismissed. The problem is that you can't paint mental health with a wide brush. Both sides reveal some portion of the truth. Personally, that's not my experience, but I also know that my experience isn't the only experience. While I subjectively did not enjoy this film - even though I do think there's a craft to the animation that should be championed, at the very least - I do think that it's also fair to try to rate it objectively low, because any film about mental health that paints with a wide brush doesn't care about you as an audience member who has had very real and very person experiences, but rather just you as an idea. When a film paints mental health with a wide brush, it doesn't see you - it only sees the idea of you. While that might be true for a lot of people's individual experiences, I don't think that we should champion films that don't care about all aspects of the truth, but only focus on one element that may not even be the most universal.",2,mary-and-max

28331,"This disgusting sexist parable of a movie left me feeling a whole array of feelings of rage I wish I could elaborate eloquently, but I am afraid this is an impossible task to take upon myself to do. All of the men in the mental ward are meant to stand as (what I take to be) a representation of a lack of democracy within social institutions. The only thing I see, however, is a group of men scared that masculine domination over the women in their lives is waning. In group therapy they discuss how domineering female figures have ruined their lives and have essentially led them to lose their mental health and stability. Nicholson's McMurphy is painted to be a hero despite the fact that he has statutorily raped a 15 year old girl, painting her as a seductress who supposedly lured him into an inevitable trap. The only thing he is a real victim of? Society calling him out on it. His misogyny is so deeply woven into most aspects of the film and is near unbearable to watch, let alone sympathize with.The other matter is that the only women that appear in the film are represented by the emasculating figure of Nurse Ratched who McMurphy never stops attempting to overpower. It is implicitly assumed that her heavy-handed authoritarianism is almost excusively attributed to her sexual frigidity, something that the other two women characters in the film (both sex workers) do not possess. They are depicted as warm, understanding figures that place no challenge to the authority that the men that surround them supposedly have. The fact that they are sexually submissive figures, contrapuntal to Nurse Ratched's character makes them ""good"" women. Nicholson's character physically strangles her at one point to establish dominance over her in front of all the other mental patients (all of which are men).Though the message on authoritarianism the film attempts to deliver is valuable and makes an effort to tackle the brutality of state sanctioned approaches to mental healthcare in the 1960s, it is of no doubt to me that the misogynistic ambience of the film's all male mental ward is a response to Betty Friedan's Feminine Mystique, published a bit before the novel upon which the film is inspired. The masculinized paranoia that resulted from the second wave of feminism in the United States undoubtedly has a legacy of film and literature, and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" decidedly asserts this fact.",0,one-flew-over-the-cuckoos-nest

I would a liken it to a final goodbye, it feels desperate and profound, searching for hope. Tarkovsky’s final work is just as metaphorical as all of his films before but with a much darker outlook than the majority of his films but still it has much to say and be deciphered. It wasn’t until the final moments where it really came together for me with a powerful and tragic finale representative of so much. It also comes with the sad realization that this is also essentially the end of Tarkovsky’s life.

I would, and do, completely understand being taken aback and engrossed with just how big in scope the journey of T.E. Lawrence is. I can also at least state that I liked Peter O'Toole's performance as the titular character. I like that he has a temper, he has an ego, it makes him an unconventional lead for a project this big, but that works more in the favor of the story than it doesn't. If you're going to have a character epic that goes on for this long, you want the person you're primarily following to not be one-note. This film does that. That said, and it does pain me somewhat to have to say this, but I mainly found the material surrounding this scale to just be passable. It's fine. I didn't think it was bad, maybe more just an instance of something not emotionally connecting with me as it should. It made me feel like I had to know ahead of time the conflict which the film is revolving around, and with historical films, that really shouldn't happen. Once the film got past a certain point, I realized that it simply didn't hook me, and that it was just going to keep on going. When I internalized that, I was able to at least sit back and admire the background details of this creation. A new instance of a movie like Persona where a part of me envies the people that can say they love it wholeheartedly, but I am who I am.6/10",5,lawrence-of-arabia

57744,"Giovanni: I no longer have inspirations, only recollections.In La Notte, Michelangelo Antonioni delves into alienation and isolation—intricately portraying the emotional and physical distance between Giovanni and Lidia (Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau respectively). Despite their marriage, they are profoundly disconnected. They wander within the urban landscape of Milan, its cold and impersonal architecture mirroring their inner emptiness. Antonioni’s meticulous framing and stark imagery capture their solitude, the disconnection that defines their relationship, and the existential experience of contemporary life.The narrative dives into Giovanni and Lidia’s estrangement and psyche. Giovanni’s infidelity and Lidia’s introspection lay bare their mutual dissatisfaction. A visit to their dying friend Tommaso (Bernhard Wicki) exposes their contrasting emotional responses, further straining their bond. Giovanni’s detachment and Lidia’s grief underscore their divergent ways of coping with life’s inevitable decay, bringing to the surface the emptiness that has settled between them.Communication breakdown is central in La Notte—with Giovanni and Lidia’s interactions marked by silence and miscommunication. Their inability to connect meaningfully portrays a communication breakdown in modern relationships. Antonioni contrasts public and private spheres, highlighting the disparity between their external personas and internal realities. This struggle to connect deepens the portrayal of their failing marriage and reflects the broader disintegration of meaningful interaction in contemporary society.Giovanni’s flirtation with Valentina (Monica Vitti) at a party shows his search for meaning and escape from his marital problems. Valentina embodies the allure and emptiness of the social elite, perhaps even Giovanni’s longing for something beyond his hollow success. In contrast, Lidia’s interaction with Roberto (Giorgio Negro), another guest at the party, mirrors Giovanni’s infidelity and becomes her own quest for connection. Both Giovanni and Lidia’s pursuits of intimacy are doomed by deep-seated loneliness and the futility of seeking solace outside their marriage.Through these parallel narratives, La Notte becomes a profound meditation on the complexities of human relationships and the search for authentic connection. The film’s visual style—characterized by its stark imagery and meticulous framing—enhances its thematic depth, making it a compelling watch for anyone interested in the intricacies of human emotions and the search for meaning in an often indifferent world.Michelangelo Antonioni ranked | Best of the 1960s",8,la-notte
21853,"You know those classics that every year you insist that you'll finally get around to watching? Well Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life had been on my Watchlist longer than I've had my big grey beard, and after ticking White Christmas off my list last year, my obvious Yuletide blindspots are diminishing with every passing year. Capra's film has been another of those films that has been all over the UK Christmas television schedules yet again this year, something which makes its omission from my watched list rather embarrassing, well I managed to fit it in as my last film of 2022, and although my Blu Ray had both a colour and an original black and white version of the film, it felt only fitting to see it as Capra and James Stewart would have wanted us to. Greatest Christmas film? I'm afraid not for me, but I can fully understand the love and appreciation this film gets in spades, because it'll bring tears to the hardest of hearts, and in both James Stewart and the beautiful Donna Reed we had two actors willing to go that extra mile. A tale about family, about friendship and loyalty, about community and how important every member of that community can be, in essence it's still a Christmas fantasy film that'll make you blart. We have goodies and baddies here, with Lionel Barrymore well cast in the role as Stewart's George Bailey's nemesis, and I would heartily agree that for the majority of this film, it takes a very pessimistic view of the times the residents of Bedford Falls are living in. Accusations that the film has a Communist leaning also seems fanciful at best, but I could see given the Post-War Era how some of this could have been seen that way? But where does Clarence the Angel fit in to the Communist agenda? It's those little touches of brilliance, especially in that final twenty minutes or so that elevates this above a host of 1940's  dramas, and with a supporting cast that features everyone from Ward Bond to Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame to Virginia Patton, Stewart and Reed don't have to quite do everything on their own here. A film that I won't wait 76 years to watch again, I can see this becoming a Yuletide regular, and with each new James Stewart film I encounter, his stature as one the greats is only enhanced with each viewing. This was also my first Capra film, something that won't last long with Mr. Smith Goes to Washington lined up in January, I'm sure I'll delve deeper into his filmography sooner rather than later, did he make many Westerns?",7,its-a-wonderful-life

The way the film builds up with the daily errand and responsibility with each members of the most unique family I've seen in films is exceptional but the pay off at the near end is what makes this film absorbing compelling and filled with human emotions in indescribable way. The film acknowledges that in a weird family we sometimes don't take the correct decision for the family's best interest but the intention is always there to help each other and always looking out for people.  Hirokazu Kore-eda did something with this film I've never seen and that is too neither make the main characters villain nor the hero but let the audience understand their situation and let us know they are fucked up but because it's the situation which is forcing them to do shoplifting through kids, in a selfish way they do wanna look out for one another and even though this poor and sad fairytale is gonna end they are trying their best to not abandon their loved ones. The director choices of taking long shots and showing the struggle emotionally, physically and economically in the most fascinating way hit me very hard. And now that I've seen the film i can't see the poster with dry eyes. The film has absolute power of love and empathy and the way film ended with the kid SAYING THAT WORD made me bawling out in front of laptop and damn that felt like a personal experience to me.

39868,"Quarantine Movie Club RankedWhen making auto-biographies, even somewhat fictionalized, it's very rare to find one that is so filled with honest self reflection. Bob Fosse pours everything he has into writing Joe Gideon with as much honesty as possible, no matter how depressing or aggravating. It's obvious that Bob Fosse knows he could have died because of the path he took in life, and that clarity is the main thing that makes All That Jazz so great.I haven't seen Roy Scheider in many things, but the few projects I have seen involving him have had spectacular performances by him. This however is most likely his best. He brings the character of Joe Gideon to life, and it is only through the combinations of his and Fosse's talent that a character so vibrant and thoroughly fleshed out is able to exist.The music is pretty great. Although it is used sparingly, the musical numbers and dance scenes are some of the best in the movie. The reprise of Take Off With Us is phenomenal, and the cinematography really helps to capture the beautiful dancing. Bye Bye Life is also a fantastic addition. and its a toss up between those two on which is my favorite of the movie.Bob Fosse was a incredibly interesting man, and this is one of the most interesting ways to frame a biopic that I have seen. Although there are some rough spots, I highly recommend it.",7,all-that-jazz
31156,"PT:""Eu quero conhecimento. Não crença. Não suposições. Mas conhecimento.""""Eu vivo agora em um mundo de fantasmas...um prisioneiro em meus sonhos.""Ao mesmo tempo que eu considero um filme confuso, também o chamo de uma reflexão sobre a vida passageira e eternidade.Assisti o filme por recomendação aqui do Letterboxd (obrigado Amanda!) E sem saber o que iria assistir dei uma chance ao encontrar no YouTube. Somos apresentados há dois homens, um cavaleiro e seu ajudante(?) Que estão em uma praia, voltando das longas cruzadas, nisso há o primeiro encontro com um ser que amedronta a todos os humanos, a morte, mas em vez de simplesmente morrer, ele a convida para uma partida de xadrez...e assim tudo se inicia.A morte, todos nós somos reféns dela, todos vivemos com medo, mas a situação de jogar xadrez com a mesma me remete a uma certa luta, um combate do ser o humano ao inevitável já que todos os dias lutamos contra essa realidade, contra esse pensamento e ao próprio Memento Mori (lembre-se da morte) que nos percorre, nos rodeia já que cada dia vivido, ainda é menos um dia de existência.Eu o considero um filme meio longo, com algumas cenas que talvez tenha achado longas demais, mas é apenas minha opinião, já que sei que muitos admiram, acho complicado agora pensando em como contar sobre o filme, como mencionar partes sem que talvez estraguem a experiência de quem vá assistir então irei ser mais breve e focar especialmente na ideia que o filme aborda em todo seu tempo, a vida e a morte. Cada personagem que aos poucos vai sendo introduzindo nos mostra diferentes tipos de visões quanto ao ambiente que vivem e seus pensamentos sobre a morte, como o próprio cavaleiro que é um homem religioso e frustrado pelo silêncio divino que faz se sentir sozinho e ao mesmo tempo é ensurdecedor, o seu companheiro mais cético quanto a tudo, mais frio ao ambiente ao seu redor, por conta de todo o caos real e além de outros o que eu mais prestei atenção foi a família, da trupe de artistas em como eles perante todos os outros vêem ao redor e a vida com uma continuação, com esperança por conta do seu filho, uma visão totalmente oposta dos personagens que cercado pelo caos e morte a constantemente esperam.O que me chama atenção é o longo debate sobre o além vida, sobre o que há depois que formos embora, com a ideia de um futuro nos céus ou simplesmente abraçar a escuridão e o vazio, nos faz refletir sobre para nós, não os personagens, para nós o que há depois daqui? A esperança que de há uma outra vida que apenas é mostrada dependendo dos nossos atos aqui em terra, um vazio onde devemos viver ao máximo o hoje porque além daqui não há nada e também a vida onde ao morrermos há a reencarnação...há tantos tipos de ideias e conceitos sobre o que irá acontecer depois e eu gosto como o filme não te deixa em uma zona de conforto com aventura, romance e etc, não ele sempre está te fazendo pensar, vendo como e quais ideais são como os seus.Não o vejo como um filme negativo ao mesmo tempo que sempre nos faça ver, que não importa o quanto lutemos contra, jogamos xadrez ou qualquer coisa a morte irá chegar a fazendo o ato mais inevitável do mundo mas ao mesmo tempo, nos últimos cinco minutos eu acho, ele deixa em evidência que há esperança, porque em meio a toda escuridão, todo mal também há luz, seja como você queira interpretar, o que nos mantém realistas mas esperançosos.Sei que falei pouco sobre o filme, mas nem ao menos eu sei direito como narrar as partes sem parecer confuso ou até sem graça, já que não quero impactar experiências, mas imagino como esse filme deve ter tirado todos que foram assistir da zona de conforto, apresentando algo para se refletir, por minutos ou até horas. Enfim, eu deixo aqui minha recomendação, acho que vale por toda a reflexão que ele trás que se intensificou quando ainda fui assistir uns vídeos sobre, veja de mente aberta, se permita pensar sobre tudo porque esse filme é um clássico e agora eu entendo a razão.ENG:""I want knowledge. Not belief. Not assumptions. But knowledge.""""I live now in a world of ghosts...a prisoner in my dreams.""While I consider it a confusing film, I also call it a reflection on the passing life and eternity.I watched the movie on a recommendation here from Letterboxd (Thanks Amanda!) And not knowing what I was going to watch I gave it a shot by finding it on YouTube. We are introduced to two men, a knight and his helper(?) who are on a beach, returning from long crusades, in this there is the first encounter with a being that frightens all humans, death, but instead of simply dying, he invites her to a game of chess...and so it all begins.Death, we are all hostages of it, we all live in fear, but the situation of playing chess with it reminds me of a certain fight, a struggle of the human being against the inevitable since every day we fight against this reality, against this thought and to the Memento Mori itself (remember death) that runs through us, surrounds us since every day lived is still one less day of existence.I consider it a rather long film, with some scenes that I may have found too long, but it's just my opinion, since I know that many admire it, I find it complicated now thinking about how to tell about the film, how to mention parts without perhaps spoiling the experience of those who will watch, so I will be more brief and focus especially on the idea that the film addresses throughout, life and death. Each character that is gradually introduced shows us different types of visions as to the environment they live in and their thoughts about death, such as the knight himself who is a religious man frustrated by the divine silence that makes him feel alone and at the same time is deafening, his companion who is more skeptical about everything, His companion is more skeptical of everything, colder to the environment around him, because of all the real chaos, and besides others, what I paid attention to the most was the family, the troupe of artists and how they see their surroundings and life as a continuation, with hope because of their son, a totally opposite view of the characters who, surrounded by chaos and death, are constantly waiting.What calls my attention is the long debate about the afterlife, about what there is after we are gone, with the idea of a future in the heavens or simply embracing the darkness and emptiness, makes us reflect about for us, not the characters, for us what there is after here? The hope that there is another life that is only shown depending on our actions here on earth, a void where we must live today to the fullest because beyond here there is nothing and also the life where when we die there is reincarnation...there are so many types of ideas and concepts about what will happen after and I like how the movie doesn't leave you in a comfort zone with adventure, romance and etc, no it is always making you think, seeing how and what ideals are like yours.I don't see it as a negative movie at the same time that always makes you see, that no matter how hard you fight against it, play chess or whatever, death will come making it the most inevitable act in the world but at the same time, in the last five minutes I think, it makes it evident that there is hope, because amidst all the darkness, all the evil there is also light, however you want to interpret it, which keeps you realistic but hopeful.I know I have said little about the movie, but I don't even know how to narrate the parts without sounding confusing or even dull, since I don't want to impact experiences, but I imagine how this movie must have taken everyone who went to watch it out of their comfort zone, presenting something to reflect on for minutes or even hours. Anyway, I leave here my recommendation, I think it is worth for all the reflection that it brings that intensified when I watched some videos about it, see it with an open mind, allow yourself to think about everything because this movie is a classic and now I understand why.",8,the-seventh-seal

85317,"There’s a reason that victims of sexual assault are scared to speak out. Will we be believed? Mocked? Ignored? Shamed?There’s countless examples of people speaking out against abuse only to be called a liar, an attention-seeker, a whore. Lying just to hurt a man, lying just to get attention. Even though 99% of the time it’s real. Our pain is real. I know it’s hard to believe that these bad things can happen, but they do. So I understand why people choose to believe that it’s not real and that we’re lying because it’s easier than thinking the world is cruel enough for this happen as often as it does. But I promise you, it does. And if you’ve ever experienced it, you are not surprised at just how cruel the world can be. So I heavily question the necessity of this movie. Sure, it’s well made. Sure, Mads Mikkelsen gave a great performance. And I understand what it’s saying and what it’s going for. And I do feel for this man, who is innocent. But what are we getting out of this besides a justification for those who believe that abused people are lying? Now they can watch this movie and think: oh that poor man. And they can look towards the news and see the men being condemned for their abuse and have that little inkling of thought- what if he doesn’t deserve this?I’m here to assure you he does. I’m not saying that no one ever lies, but do we really need this story right now? It’s not as though sexual abuse survivors are typically shown any sympathy in our society. Why do we need just more examples of why they shouldn’t be? I know some might say that I’m overthinking this and taking it too personally. But when I look at the news and I see a rapist leading our country, calling all of the women that he’s hurt liars and sluts... I just look to this movie with a sick feeling in my gut. As a verification for those who can claim “witch hunt” in the face of accusations.It is hard to come forward when you’ve been abused.

What's... wrong? You suck my dick. That's what's wrong. And you, you fucking call me ‘lady’? Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on both of you.”Magnolia opens with electricity but a confused one. The film fills our heads with this notion of chance with small anecdotes of suffering and death. It reminds us cut after cut--this is not a matter of chance. It is here where our characters are more appropriately introduced though just as chaotically. It goes from person to person as if time is being fast-forwarded by some eternal being that, when it gets to our characters, misses and has to rewind and refocus. Despite the chaotic introductions it is not hard to follow. PT Anderson is the king of the unique character introduction and this film is full of them. Following these first few minutes--likely it was close to ten or fifteen--is more a test of one’s place in life. It asks many questions one I’ve already addressed which involves superstition--do you believe in chance? However, with each character thrown in and out of view it feels more like the everyday moments of life where we must choose to acknowledge and address only so many people. Which one will be more important to us? Which one is worth remembering? It makes them seem petty and small just as much as the screen makes them larger than life. Of course, as the film unfolds, they are all worth remembering. Secrets are uncovered and hidden torments of the soul. What is the real gift of this three hour epic is how ignorant I was for half the movie as to the parallels of the characters. I found it much more enjoyable as I discovered their parallels. Stanley’s (Jeremy Blackman) potential older equivalent is manifested in similar kid genius, now grown-up Donnie Smith (William H. Macy). Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is on his deathbed, dying of cancer and Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) has recently discovered he is dying from cancer. Earl and Jimmy are both estranged from their children. Earl’s son Frank Mackie (Tom Cruise) is a misogynistic, self-help guru who has been in denial about his family and their past. Jimmy’s daughter Claudia (Melora Walters) is a coke addict who may or may not have been abused by her father but the emotional trauma is nevertheless right on the surface. Earl reveals to his nurse Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman) that he had cheated on his ex-wife countless times. His current wife, Linda (Julianne Moore), is suffering from immense guilt and pain because when she initially married Earl it was for his money. Jimmy reveals to his wife, Rose (Melinda Dillon), that he has cheated on her several times and that he may have molested their daughter, but he can’t remember. Rose is then faced with guilt over her relationship with her daughter and whether or not to be there for her dying husband. It is in these parallels where PTA’s intertwining narratives are more moving and realistic than Haggis’ attempt in Crash or Iñárritu’s in Babel. They seem to reference the accountability of all of us to each other and how without that accountability bad things happen. PT Anderson denies that approach. Instead he looks at the world and all of these small horrific things that can happen to an individual. He sees loneliness, guilt, regret and isolation. It is only when tragedy happens that people come together--that the ties that bind them are fully acknowledged and not, conversely, dismantled or destroyed. PT Anderson is more concerned about the connectedness of our futures and our pasts and how we move forward. Whether we embrace forgiveness and turn the car around and drive over the frogs that plagued us the day before. The effortlessness at which PT Anderson reveals these hidden traumas and lets the inevitable conclusions of them wash over the film is a product of the man’s ingenious direction. Also aiding the success is the cast which is huge and glorious with everyone being a standout in some way. Melora Walters doesn't get enough credit and her performance seems to have lost interest in the passing years given her mostly inactive career. It's a shame because she takes one of the more emotional roles and makes the easily misread coke-addict, sympathetic and memorable.Tom Cruise ,  Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman are the standouts for me. Cruise’s role is juicy. He is forced to be a sexual being and as someone who has always seen him as more of an asexual Ken doll it was very rewarding. The part, though eventually tragic, is reminiscent of Cruise’s great comedic work in Tropic Thunder. When he’s hot he’s hot. I’d see Julianne Moore’s scene from the pharmacy in a class. For the life of me I cannot remember the context--maybe sound design? I had naively thought the scene, given her power and anguish, would have been more of a climactic scene of the film but instead it falls into place a lot earlier than expected. Watching that scene is even more breathtaking in context but more heartbreaking as you follow the aftermath and deterioration of her character. Her redemption was the most rewarding for me. Her small moment of forgiveness with Philip Seymour Hoffman’s character, sums up the film for me. It’s taking all of your emotion--your anger, fear, sadness--and putting on to other people because you don’t know what else to do. Usually those people are innocents. Usually those people suffer because of it. The key is to ask for forgiveness and to grow from that decision. The film’s sound design and score made some of the best parts more perfect than imaginable and parts that would otherwise be forgotten, remembered. Despite, the incredible cast and challenging directing the film still comes out too cold for my taste. It’s an incredible film to analyze but it’s emotions felt more distant than I would have liked. This seems to be more a product of it’s length which serves to fulfill all the character arcs but pulls the audience out of each individual arc too long to connect specifically to one or two of the emotions billowing. This is also due to the weird perspective the film takes which, as I said above, feels like some weird chaotic energy or eternal being. It alienates the narratives and made me, as an audience member, feel unrelated to what I watched, like whoever controlled all of this had complete apathy for what occurred but it would happen anyway. PT Anderson puts us in the mind of a non-intervening God, which is almost impossible for a film of this emotional and narrative depth. In the end it feels more an enjoyment after I watch it then when I do which is not necessarily a bad thing but I prefer to be inspired as I watch not forced to come to conclusions after.",6,magnolia

20802,"The Ultimate Challenge - Film #11Once again a very simplistic story pulled into a visually complex presentation. The story of human love against the love for a career, a theme ever present in films about artists themselves. That meta-fictional theme is undoubtedly what keeps The Red Shoes together but unfortunately is also what makes it drag so much in the first half. The first hour or so leading up to the groundbreaking sequence and first performance of the eponymous play is basically all intro. It introduced the setting, the characters but nothing more. The real story only starts after this and while the whole film is still as beautiful as can be in its theatrical look, performance and appearance, it only really gives depth to the story when the dramatic arc of the love triangle is introduced. When this happens, during this magical first performance, the truest beauty of the film comes into play as the produced ballet interplays with the situation behind the scenes. It's a simple way of creating enticing and immersing stories, but that doesn't take away that it works wonderfully well.Aside from this ostensibly minor flaw, the film is a gorgeous whole. Technically speaking there isn't a single thing to complain about. Every productional value is at its peak. Costumes, sets and music are what make a film like this breath and in that sense it breaths heavily. Its influences stretch all the way till today in works such as Whiplash or Black Swan which only shows its impressive strength amongst such different genres, after so many years. So while it may not be a great achievement story-wise, it certainly is a technical marvel that feels utterly modern a mere seventy years later.PRETTY BRILLIANT!!",8,the-red-shoes

18119,"DirectorQuest: 44/100Spike Lee: 2/5Wake up.The montage of a few of the characters hurling slurs towards the camera is one of the best individual scenes I've seen from a film maybe period? And to not long after follow that up with the iconic love/hate scene? After being mixed on BlacKkKlansman and just loathing his Oldboy remake, this is the Spike I've heard so much about. I loved the characters. I loved the dialogue. I loved the colors. I loved the camerawork. I loved the soundtrack. Love, love, love, that is the word of the day with this movie. Yet, there's such an incredible sense of rage that this film has, something that starts from the beginning and just keeps bubbling until it reaches its horrifying climax. Do the Right Thing makes clear that hate is something that brings nothing but further destruction to whatever it touches, yet it has a clear understanding of where hate comes from. Sometimes hate has no justification, or a false sense of one, and other times the hate seems perfectly justified. But, hate is hate, and it burns. Above its intense energy, I think my favorite aspect about Do the Right Thing may just be all of its characters. This is how all ensemble films should feel like. Just about every character in the film, if not fully fleshed-out, at least feels so lived in. I could watch a two hour film of just the three guys sitting in front of the red bricks shooting the shit. If I also had to pick a favorite character/performance, it's absolutely Ossie Davis as Da Mayor. I think he best captures what makes this movie so good. He has so much experience, so much to say, yet he is flawed in a way that is impossible to ignore. But, as he says, he has so much love to give. Could absolutely boost this up to five stars after just letting it settle for the rest of the day, but even if it stays where it is, this blew me the fuck away. Not sure if he's one for them, but if I ever meet Spike, I want to give him a hug. Masterful filmmaking, and that's the truth, Ruth.9.5/10",8,do-the-right-thing

It also gets a bit cheesy in terms of drama. The moral dilemmas seem a bit plaintive and the Italian drama comes to the fore anyway. I also didn't find the main character particularly sympathetic, just because he loses himself in the situation so much, harass people, be pushy, falsely accuse. So not really strong in terms of ending and drama, but at times interesting as a whole.",3,bicycle-thieves
70609,"Bergman's religious films can be a bit challenging for me, but this was easier for me to absorb than The Seventh Seal, the last Bergman film I watched. First of all, this has one linear story, rather than a bunch of moving parts. Also, I've seen First Reformed, and I feel like Winter Light has a really similar story to the first half of First Reformed.However, I do think the two films are different thematically. Winter Light is a lot more grounded in reality, and focuses solely on Tomas' struggle with his faith. It's a bit compact, but I felt like I really understood who Tomas was in just an 80-minute runtime. I love that scene where he goes to the river to check on the corpse and the sounds of the water just overpower all the dialogue.Ingmar Bergman Ranked",6,winter-light

65994,"Watched as part of the Watchlist Genre ChallengeSimilar to Se7en and Zodiac (two movies i'm not crazy about) so naturally this did not work for me as it's a lesser version of those two. The initial mystery was so captivating and got me fully on board. I like the atmosphere and the almost fantasy elements that spice up the usual Zodiac-ish recipe with the killer. A real good start but it runs out of ideas somewhere in the second act and after that it's just rince, repeat, rince, repeat... until I got irritated and disinterested in the outcome. There's no twist really at the end, it just hits a brick wall and expects you to come up with an ending. So flat. Nothing memorable.The main character is the worst detective ever, he can't even interrogate someone for more than 5 minutes without having an outburst of emotions—but at the same time I get it, the killer is very irritating! No charisma or personality in sight, just a robot that pops out questions. I didn't really feel much watching this movie either, it tries to get emotional a few times but it was just poor and cheesy. Very light horror elements, this is more of a dark crime thriller with a couple of bloody scenes.",3,cure

81095,"As opposed to the plethora of World War II movies that took place in the middle of battle, this one here delves into the characters’ lives right after returning from the war. Three characters’ stories about how they handle trying to earn a normal living back in the US — Fred Derry, a captain and bombardier, can’t wait to get home to see his folks and his wife (who he hasn’t even been married to twenty days before he left to fight for the country); Homer Parrish, petty officer, lost both his hands and has yet for his whole family including his fiancé to see the new him; and Al Stephenson, platoon sergeant, has got his wife and two grown up kids awaiting his surprise return. Better yet, the three of these servicemen are from the same Midwestern Boone City. The best thing that Wyler did was not only focusing on the plight of three men to get their normal lives back, but intertwining each of the veterans’ stories with each other. Will Homer’s fiancé still accept him although he’s lost his hands and has somewhat become a changed man? Will Al adjust to the fact that he’s missed a good chunk of years seeing his kids grow up? And will Fred’s wife accept him after those years away, or will he have to become a lone wanderer searching for a new place in this world?Fun, mundane reality, heartbreak, and patriotism steeped within stories that connect together like branches of a tree. Following the characters’ journey is one thing, but to see each journey fall into place like it was meant to be through a test of wills, challenges, and true love is really fantastic. Not only is this a great story of servicemen and veterans, but it is also an imaginative love story to top off the best years of life. Every character is really someone you’d love to have over for dinner. Except Fred’s wife, Marie. For those saying that this movie was too long or dragged too often, come on. The Best Years of Our Lives is truly as a friend of mine called it, an “All time great film.”It was real and honest through the theatricality of it all (it ain’t Shakespearean melodrama, but raw honesty). Al Stephenson is undeniably great. Harold Russell, with no acting experience, was a natural talent. Dana Andrews and Teresa Wright were both my favorite talents of this flick, and if you’ve seen it, you’ll know why.Happy Veterans Day! 🇺🇸",9,the-best-years-of-our-lives
34869,"Reposting from a reply I left on a comment I liked:I thought I was watching a masterpiece as complex real-world events were interpreted through a variety of world views. I felt as though the film was ambiguous as to what interpretation mapped onto the events best.Which view has the greatest explanatory power? Which view provides the best emotional/ psychological bedrock in times of grief? Which view will lead to fortune or misfortune? (Or is this a nonsensical question altogether) Theism, Deism, atheism?However, the ambiguity in this film collapses in the final six minutes into:“Johannes is actually Jesus Christ. Morten’s perspective of trusting god in times of grief and believing that god might have reasons beyond his understanding was insufficient, he should’ve believed his lunatic son was Jesus Christ. The pastor’s view is wrong: a god DOES intervene in the natural world and he was WRONG earlier in the film to question whether Johannes was actually Jesus Christ. He was WRONG to ask for some verification for Johannes’ professed divinity. Further still, Mikkel’s view is wrong, god is evident to those that genuinely trust in him. There aren’t really hard questions pertaining to the compatibility of a loving god and wanton suffering. One could even ask god to resurrect a loved one if that person believes with the faith of a child.”If I could give 0/5 stars, I would. What a joke film.",0,ordet
40055,"My thoughts on The 400 Blows…“Here lies poor Antoine Doinel, unjustly punished by Sourpuss for a pinup fallen from the sky. It will be an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!”Being brutally honest, this is one of the more underwhelming films I watched, It wasn’t necessarily mediocre nor was it good, it’s indescribable, I wasn’t captured throughout but I was amused by the smaller details within the film such as the brilliant score and the dynamic between the two boys, that’s about it for me personally. I adored the atmospheric charm of the french streets alongside the endearing score, just something about the french new wave and their stylistic approach to everything is nothing but joyous, especially when it’s keeping you entertained periodically whenever the arid narrative isn’t being conveyed. I really wanted to enjoy this but at times it felt like a chore to get through some of the sequences with it not having much substance to work off of with it feeling monotonous when inside and lifeless during the conversations, although, the imagery nearing the end was potent with it encompassing the captivity of these children extremely well, with it’s raw, authentic and realistic approach.Usually I can write a lot more but i’m struggling with this one because it feels like there isn’t anything more which is worth writing about, I can understand and appreciate the love for this film but it wasn’t for me.",3,the-400-blows

The scene where they discuss, without explicitly collaborating, a path for Mifune's Isaburo to rebel against his liege lord is masterful, as is Kobayashi's taut use of sound design, visual composition, and tonal control.

74899,"One of the undeniable masterworks of cinematic excess. With this film, Abel Gance seems to attempt to reposition France (following  on from the innovations of Georges Méliès) as the home of cinematic creativity and innovation. This becomes even more fascinating when we consider the global stage of cinema at this point, with Napoleon releasing towards the waning end of D. W. Griffith’s filmic career, and alongside the revolutionary works of Sergei Eisenstein. The established canon of cinema history, something that should be thoroughly debated, asserts the huge influence of Griffith (this being an apt time to mention that Oscar Micheaux's brilliant Within Our Gates, releasing seven years prior to Napoleon, a much more worthwhile starting point for the study of North American feature film than that famed, yet unforgivably grotesque, work of Griffith) and of Eisenstein. The achievements of Eisenstein are much more apt here, as the revolutionary content of his films is matched by a similarly revolutionary approach to filmmaking: adding real weight to the holistic impact of his work.Napoleon is obviously a different figure to those depicted in the contemporary works of Eisenstein, but in Gance's feature, he is positioned as a revolutionary figure. Controversially so, this film focuses on the early stages of Napoleon's life, and only on them. Therefore, it does serve as a hagiographic portrait of a figure that would, to put it mildly, become deeply controversial. The film builds up to statements about fighting to liberate oppressed people, a statement that inspires in the moment but that stands uncomfortably against the actions undertook during Napoleon's reign (including a reinstation of enslavement in France's overseas colonies). The Eurocentric statements attributed to Napoleon in this film therefore smack of elitism and European supremacy, as opposed to a pursuance of the more widely human, and egalitarian, ideals of actual liberty and freedom. Much of this can be explained, though not excused, by how this film was supposed to be the first chapter in a six part series. A, seemingly, projected thirty hour complete work that would cover the totality of Napoleon, and perhaps confront the later stages of his history, and how they exist incongruously against this revolutionary opening.The point stands, though, that revolutionary technique seems to follow revolutionary content. The attempt seems to be to capture the dynamism, originality and boldness of the figure. It is a strategy that has all but died out, in which modern biopics (this is certainly a biopic) now exist as one of the most rote and formulaic genres. Expression takes a backseat to what boils down to filmed Wikipedia articles, with no attempt to evoke a human's importance through cinematic form. Gance seems to think, if they are important enough to be cinema, that importance should be expressed through cinema.This results in Napoleon being one of the most impressive films ever made, especially considering its age (as we get ever closer to this being a century old). The influence of this film is now widely recognised (as shown by its repeated inclusion on best of lists, both critic and user voted), as well as how revivals of it in the '50s allowed it to be a key influence on the filmmaking of the French New Wave. And this is hardly unsurprising, as despite the daunting 333 minute runtime, the film consistently seems to stylistically reinvent or outdo itself. Admittedly, the film's penultimate part is a low point (focusing on a more domestic drama, or more conventional plotting, and the point where the film starts to feel its length). But, this is followed by the legendary tryptic sequence, which is one of the most astonishing extended sequences in cinema.This film then, as a piece of filmmaking as opposed to an effective vessel for themes and political impact, sits comfortably alongside the innovative work of Eisenstein. After all, to watch Napoleon is to be consistently astonished. Cinema was expected to be static, in terms of camera work that is. A limited form with set conventions and certain things that work. Gance goes for everything, but his most enduring contribution is the amount of movement. The camera feels untethered and dynamic, the usage of handheld photography a real innovation in this work. It makes the whole film spirited and alive, and is perfectly matched by editing with an equal sense of momentum.So many scenes just stun the viewer. A relatively early sequence juxtaposes a political meeting with Napoleon in a small boat that is being thrown around by giant waves in the sea. The visual comparison is strong, a sense of revolutionary defiance against the odds: a sea change, an act of real importance. The boat scene alone is breath-taking, the way that the the meeting hall starts to move like the sea, as the visual field distorts and we are thrown to-and-fro within a static environment, that is nothing short of exceptional.In this mode, the picture is revolutionary. Though, interestingly, the actual narrative feels secondary. The characterisations are thin and the focus is more on realising key moments than it is on forging a cohesive feature. A choice to demarcate which intertitles come from historical records is a welcome one, and speaks to the film's dual purpose as historic document. It is a flawed historic document, though, embarking away from realism due to its one note, heroic portrayal of this figure in which Napoleon is messianic, a proto-typical superhero in a film that starts to establish an action movie template.The film does capture the subjective sense, though: the cult of personality around a figure. If people are told to print the legend, this work films it (though, of course, predates that quotation). This feels more akin to a Homer adaptation than a historical one, showing the early life of Napoleon as a heroic odyssey, and one that is deeply satisfying on a purely cinematic level. Again, the messaging is flawed but the feel of the film is one of revolution.And thus, the legend endures. This is a bloated, overlong and hyperbolic ode to a figure. An inappropriate one at that. But it is a work of consummate cinematic maximalism and, as a piece of cinematic history, it is searingly vital. The experimentations and visual achievements will even inspire the filmmakers of today, especially due to the sheer practicality of them. This is movie magic, this is using the constituent parts of cinema (the essentials) to craft something utterly unique. It is a towering work, one of nationalistic fervour that would only, for me, be eclipsed by the superlative War and Peace from Sergei Bondarchuk, another attempt to demonstrate a nation's glory through, what is ostensibly, a national legend.",7,napoleon

2369,"If Part 1 was ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" and Part 2 was ""Full Metal Jacket"" (with a bit of Saving Private Ryan in there)  Then Part 3 is basically ""The Odyseey""/""Cold Mountain"" (with a bit of The Walking Dead in there) Part 3 is largely about Kaji and the two guys who miraculously somehow managed to survive the last half hour of Part 2 wandering thru the bombed out devastated countryside in the vague hopes of going home to find his wife Michiko (whom I didn't even mention but she was a major character in Part 1 and loomed large in Part 2 even tho we only saw her briefly in that first hour when she comes to visit him on base while a recruit) So it's Kaji wandering around beyond tired and exhausted and in a burnt out state of mind (saying he's suffering from PTSD would be severely understating it) I'm not gonna lie, it's a grind to get thru, because it's just an unrelentingly grim slog--and that's before he gets taken prisoner of war by a Russian unit and sent to work as a prisoner of war (much like the prisoners of war he used to oversee long ago in Part 1) in some refuge camp and it is just an absolute desolate bleak nightmare existence Kaji has been left in. Forget about the world going to hell, it's like he's a survivor in a post nuclear apocalypse and has to contend with the other survivors in this burnt out hell that is now what his life is from which there is no escape because this is what Japan is now--and that's before Nagasaki and Hiroshima take place!!! (It's bad there folks!)   I'm rating this slightly lower than Parts 1 and 2, not cause it's not as good, nor as powerful (if anything it's even more blunt and in your face about how God awful just existing on this planet can be in this particular time and place) Reason I'm rating this slightly lower is just cause unlike the other two parts which had a story that I could latch onto--the entire story here is basically Kaji is trying to keep himself going, trying to somehow get home to his wife, and just can't get anywhere. That's pretty much it. There's the usual array of petty tyrants and bullies he has to do battle with but he's so beaten down by the events of the previous two movies that forget about moral code, it's all he can do to not brutally strangle them with his own bare hands. It's undeniably powerful, but a little of it goes a long way, and the fact is that I'm not sure that the narrative that's here (It's him in the Russian prisoner of war camp and trying to figure out a way to communicate with the people there) is remotely as compelling as those in the other two parts. On the other hand the fact that this doesn't have as neat and tidy a narrative arc may make this the more interesting of the three parts to some because you generally don't know what's gonna happen to Kaji as he stumbles his way (one foot in front of the other) in hopes of not dying. Basically you see him become a barbarian as opposed to the high minded elite young man he started out the trilogy as being and attempted to stay as being in Part 2 even tho life was beating into him a certain hard fought lesson.I think it's entirely possible that this leans TOO far into sheer misery and utter degradation--it feels weird watching this all in one day (I watched all 9.5 hours of this in one sitting more or less) and unlike Parts 1 & 2, this is just absolute misery on a massive scale without any sense of hope to it. I didn't think the ending was as gut wrenching as the ending to Part 2 (which to be fair would seem to be impossible to top) and it doesn't stab you in the heart with the unfairness of the situation the way the ending to Part 1 does with his exemption being cruelly taken away from him after everything he had been put thru at that iron mine. However the ending is fitting given the complete and total slog that this starts out as and never lets up as being for it's entire three hour runtime--Good Job!",5,the-human-condition-iii-a-soldiers-prayer

A pile of charred bodies and a head impaled on a stick! Okay, things are looking up.Themes and motives seem darker in The Two Towers, and I am here for it. But… that's all. The three interweaving plots are all boring, full of exposition, and with characters who never change or become interesting. It's not a good sign when the most compelling character is created by a computer. Got to give it to Gollum and the legendary Andy Serkis, as easily the figure most worth watching here in a mind-numbingly long movie. I'm getting a little tired of the gender roles here. Every woman -- there don't seem to be many of them -- is either svelte and weeping over a man, or a hideous wench. None of them are heroes. Why? Are only men capable of saving the world? The women here seem intelligent when they speak, often saying profound things about truth or humanity or chivalry. The men are allowed to say shit like ""this is a good sword"" or ""today we fight!"" and we all cheer. None of this is surprising coming from Tolkien, stalwart for the criminal syndicate of the Catholic Church and the masculine cult at its center, and defender of holy wars and the slaughter of innocents of different faiths.It's also disappointing to see basically zero ethnic diversity in the casting. These are fictional characters who Peter Jackson could have molded and reshaped if he wanted. So he made them all white. Every single one. Creative.But the biggest problem, despite being markedly better than the first film, is that The Two Towers is all spectacle and no bite, all flash and no story. You're telling me I had to watch people walking and arguing for three hours -- with the occasional decapitation -- so literally none of their plotlines could be resolved? So I have to wait for the third part for any of that? Good lord. Whose trajectory has changed by the end of the film? What purpose did any of these slow treks have? The pacing of this movie is absolutely brutal, stopping and starting up again over and over, with aimless wandering and dragging out of eeevvveerrrry moment. Moreover, yes of course the production design is fabulous, but instead of that element of wonder as we discover Middle Earth with the others in the first film, here it's all just one dark road after another. Where's that beautiful New Zealand we fell in love with? Save for a couple early sweeping shots of mountains, it ain't here.Yes the final battle is pretty amazing, single handedly earning another half-star for the picture. We even got a prominent Wilhelm scream. That's good shit. Otherwise? Not a lot better overall as the middle act drags at a snail's pace just begging to be skipped to the end. It's wizards and warriors and talking trees and so many horses and men who need to get a fuckin' haircut. If your hair is that long you need to be in a thrash metal band.Part three tomorrow.

33835,"Holy, poetic and emotionally shattering, Landscape in the Mist will leave a lump in your throat. Thodōros Angelopoulos' romanticism and magical realism feel extra potent when depicting a harsh reality for two children lost in the bleak mist of life itself.A sister-brother duo leaves home in search of their father in Germany, but the outside world is unkind to pure souls like them. For the 2-hour runtime, these two meet a motley crew of people on the road, and they learn the cruelty of dreams along the way. Haunting cinematography keeps the visuals interesting, and that symbolic Fellini tribute is the cherry on top. Although the second half pales compared to the first, the ending completely seals the deal, and pieces everything together. Highly recommended.",7,landscape-in-the-mist

84162,"this movie was absolutely unbearable, and no, this opinion doesn’t stem from me being “unable to wrap my head around christopher Nolan’s rich and vibrant perspective on the tragic moral dilemma of the development of the atomic bomb”. some of you need to stop blubbering like this and grow the fuck up and realize that this movie was not the breathtaking masterpiece you all were hoping it would be, and that Christopher Nolan isn’t going to pop out of the screen and slobber all over your dick because you’re defending this movie on the internet. first off, textbook overdramatization. it was so clear that Nolan wanted this movie to be some dystopian sci fi period piece rather than an honest retelling of true events (I’d encourage raving Oppenheimer fans to watch the Chernobyl miniseries to see what a dramatic retelling of true, tragic historical events should look like). second, the melodramatic acting, rapid jump cuts, and the same five incessant, recurring, loud as fuck stock suspenseful violin sounds looping over and over and over with little to no time for the audience to sit and catch their breath made this movie feel like one long trailer. completely unbearable to sit through. Cut all the bullshit, take the music out and let silence tell the story, and you’d have a pretty decent movie. but unfortunately a lot of these bigger directors can’t wrap their heads around the artistic importance of silence. to top this shitshow off, a dreadfully boring montage of court hearings that took an hour but could have easily been done in minutes. totally disappointed. what a fucking waste of money. a couple pretty alright scenes made me sit up a little in my seat, but sadly not enough to make me walk out of the theater feeling like I hadn’t completely wasted three hours of my life.",1,oppenheimer-2023
14013,"edit: this review is a mess but i’m keeping it up. read if u want to just don’t hit the like button cuz i’m at 69 likes.idk if i can say if i watch this movie cuz i spent more time looking at the runtime then paying attention to this. i can see why people enjoy this especially if u part of the lgbt community and it impact for your life but for me(i am prob bi-curious lmao idk lowkey sexually confused atm) I couldn’t be emotionally invested in it in the slightest. people say the cinematography is beautiful, but it's really not. I will admit the scenery do be looking clean and cool shots here and there but most of the time the shots just comes off feeling really standard and not memorable at all. I am guessing part of my dissatisfaction was that I came with high expectations, expectations as high as snoop dogg smoking weed especially with the cinematography since lots of people were jerking it off and it all felt underwhelming, despite that it’s still my fav aspect of the film doe. i guess another part is that i feel like the main way to make ur cinematography and overall directions be so impactful(we talking like mike tyson uppercut landing an uppercut on you kinda impact)  is by having the audience be sucked into the world/atmosphere of the movie. so while i was bored as hell it fell flat on those terms and don’t impact me. i will say those shots always make me feel rlly warm but yuh just wasn’t strong enough for me to fully love. i guess for a film about looking at painting and art as a whole as a way for expressing one’s deepest feeling and one’s connection to art. i think the main problem would most likely lie in how the film presents its theme. like we would be given the just enough information bout the characters and narrative so we get a sense of the plot, but at the same time it’s hard for me to feel the emotions between the characters and the film only does what is required to signal such emotions and development in its characters making it feel one-note.I wasn't interested in the story, but if done right it could be a heartbreaking story........................yea it's eh. While I was watching this, caring was a difficult task for me to do and I think the slow pacing had sumthing to do with it. As the movie just offered no strong emotions for me and it makes me just keep on checking the runtime every minute(been looking at my phone to see if that cute latina chick text me back, she left me on read fuck that bitch fr) I am not saying, having slow pacing is bad...BUT if you gonna have really slow moments. At least give me something engaging so you will keep my interest. Not trying to be pretentious but I am pretty sure they gonna be sum nerds out there seeing my review and say sum dumb shit like “just admit you don’t like slow burn movies 🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓” so imma compare this to other slow paced films, imma choose long ass films like Jeanne Dielman and Satantango. Since those movies are 4+ hours and they move so slow that the actor’s heart can’t beat. Anyways the reason why I was able to feel so engaged with them is that their cinematography is so addicting that I become addicted to the film cuz of it. The way the camera in Satantango slowly zooming out, adding to the atmosphere since when it does that. the audience always get a bigger picture and see more of the world of Satantango which excels at capturing the feeling of isolation is so fire and addicting bruh. So the slow pacing doesn't bother me and in fact gets a boost due to the fact that the cinematography just so nutty to look at. Now lets look at Portrait of a Lady on Fire where it gives you...it gives you...IT GIVES YOU NOTHING CUZ THIS MOVIE IS SHIT.  The characters? They just horny chicks. “NOOOOOO THEY NOT HORNY CHICKS” stfu I am objectively correct bruh. anyways, the characters fall flatter than my ass like the rest of the movie tbh. Shit movie. Now now I know I am mostly rambling/trolling and a lot of people will get mad bout me saying the movie isn’t good cuz I thought it was boring and I don’t get why it’s a bad thing. seriously doe I don’t get why I should call a movie good when it does literally nothing for me and make me forget bout it in 13 minutes. if u like portrait that’s cool. I am glad u didn’t regret watching it and was able to find a cool perspective on it(i really don’t care tbh if i gotta be fr fr). if u were planning on watching portrait but put it down cuz of me don’t, because despite my rambling and frustration, you will most likely get more out of it than me or you will be disappointed like me who knows, just give it a chance lol. sorry i just get pissed off when a movie with so much potential ends up not being fire, despite being such a tragic tale it does very little to spark my interest and I couldn’t care less bout it. what it’s contributing to lesbian cinema is pretty nice doe, considering the positive reception around it.",2,portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire

In fact, honestly, I was glad it was finally over. I don’t know if it’s my general lack of interest in the religious themes Andrei Rublev covers, or my lack of investment in the titular character, but I found this incredibly dull for the majority of its runtime.

12933,"Film Club: Pick #18Chosen by Aventador117What make Tokyo Story so good isn't its “specifications” or “complexities”, but it's simplicity instead. In fact, it has little to none of the former. Everything Ozu presents to us is personal and poignant, and in a way, painful. It tells us the tale of two parents who travel a long distance to see their children, only for the younger ones to somewhat neglect their parents and continue with their lives. How casual such blatant ignorance is portrayed is disgustingly realistic. It was painful to watch, yet somehow so real. Ozu captures the pinnacle of sheer humanity within these frames, and I respect that. This has to be one of the most thought-provoking depictions of humanity I've ever seen, and I get why Ozu is considered to be a master of that.Loved the performances, obviously. The cinematography was gorgeous and I adored the way everything was shot. Those static frames had so much of life to them. Even though they were always still, everything in the film felt so mobile and active. It's an incredibly made film, with so many fantastic themes and ideas that have stayed relevant even over half a century later. That is due to how good the execution is. Ozu did everything he could to make this movie the way it is, and it's clear that it took a lot of passion to make such a movie. It being as profound as it is doesn't make it a masterpiece. With how highly rated this film is, I expected more. I didn't expect the mundanity of the narrative to be as strong as it was. It's long, and to be honest, it isn't always that interesting. I don't think I was ever that bored because of how passionate the filmmaking was, but there could've been a little more to everything. I liked it, though. I can't wait to see more from Ozu, and honestly speaking, I really needed this movie right now. I didn't realize that until the screen turned black, but it works quite well for me.",6,tokyo-story

22407,"[Spoilers.]Not just one of the most insulting films I’ve ever seen, but most likely—and I mean this without an ounce of hyperbole—one of the worst I will ever watch in my entire life. Against my better judgement, I watched the whole thing. Where do I even start with this? Right away, the obnoxious and unnecessary music forced me to take this way less seriously. The cartoonish overacting only contributed to my indifference. This film is almost entirely dull exposition for forty-five minutes, until we’re treated to a tedious action scene in which the protagonist feels utterly invincible. At this point, hilarious Microsoft PowerPoint transitions begin explicitly guiding us from day to day, as if we can’t process the linear momentum of time.OLDBOY’s two biggest faults though, are what makes it so horrendous. Its treatment of women is disgusting. They essentially only exist to please the male characters, or as pawns to move the plot forward. I couldn’t tell you a single thing about any woman in this film. The other huge issue is the “twist”. Any cinephile will tell you that the best kind of twist is one hiding under the audience’s noses the whole time. Instead however, the twist here is just like the rest of the film: laughable and ridiculous. It’s pulled completely out of the film’s ass. Hypnosis is already a shaky enough concept on its own, so the James Bond villain speech used to explain it certainly doesn’t help its case. Ultimately, I left OLDBOY completely unaware of what to take away from it. I will never willingly revisit this film, and I definitely don’t recommend seeking it out. If you do, you’ll be confronted with film that’s not just pointless, but absolutely worthless.",1,oldboy
29616,"Like almost everyone else on planet Earth, I've never seen Jerry Lewis' infamous unreleased film, The Day the Clown Cried. However having now endured Life is Beautiful, I have some idea of just how badly a ""comedy"" drama set during the Holocaust can fail. I'm a fan of the darkest of black comedies, as ofttimes the only way to cope with evil and death is to laugh. However here writer/director/star Roberto Benigni chooses another direction, deciding that schmaltzy, uplifting feel-good attempts at humour can somehow mesh with tragedy, and to say that no such meshing is achieved is a colossal understatement. Benigni plays Guido, a Jew living in fascist Italy, and from the start he's a deeply irritating screen presence. Imagine a goofy version of Pepe le Pew doing a bad cover version of the waiter section from Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) and you're halfway there, but despite this Benigni clearly expects the audience to fall in love with him. The first act is made up of Guido's unfunny antics as he annoys everyone he comes across but somehow charms a woman away from her fiancee to marry him instead. Do I need to mention the plot is stupid and relies heavily on coincidences? Cut to a few years later he and his family are sent to a concentration camp but Guido decides to pretend it's all a game for the benefit of his young son. This is clearly where we the audience are expected to swoon and swear our utmost affection for this character, whereas what actually happens is we only hate the writer/director/star even more for the very idea this is a premise worth admiring. Some might think me hardhearted for not swooning here nor at the amazingly ill-conceived “happy” ending, but rather I'd contend that anyone who does should embark on a long conversation with themself. The German-Jewish philosopher Theodor Adorno once said that ""There can be no poetry after Auschwitz"", and while this can be contested as art is essential to understanding every aspect of the human experience, I think most should agree that the Holocaust does not mix well with japes and gambols. This is a movie for watching through a palm to the face.",0,life-is-beautiful
38196,"“Too many notes!”Oh man, this movie is amazing. It’s always kind of daunting to take on a movie with a 3 hour runtime that also holds so much praise and affection. But this was surprisingly accessible for a period piece, especially one with a 3 hour runtime.It’s very charming and has a lot of heart, mostly because of Tom Hulce’s performance (and laugh). It’s not often that the subject of a period piece from this era is someone who isn’t dry, reserved and formal. He plays a free spirited, childlike and immature Mozart, but it’s met with a perfect amount of stiffness and envy from F. Murray Abraham’s Salieri. On their own, they give great performances, but their scenes together are incredible. They play off of each other perfectly.Obviously, the music is amazing too but the real achievement is how it’s woven into the narrative structure. Although it’s becoming more frequent, it’s usually very rare to find a film that puts sound as an equal counterpart to visuals.

77329,"a good story with great performances, adapted from what is presumably a great manga. however, the film’s structure (following one game and interspersing flashbacks) is exhausting. thrown into this national final basketball game after the opening, i found myself wondering “am i supposed to care about this team just because they’re the underdogs?” i had no other characterization, no other context to the story. the game is so boring in the first half it made me wonder how it could possibly be adapted from the manga medium, so devoid was it of any narration, dialogue, story, or character. a lot of reviews praise the animation. i see this a lot when people talk about recent anime (particularly films). given the state of current technology and the budget of these sorts of productions, it feels like a given that the anime look good, and it’s often the first thing people praise. “i wasn’t so taken by the story but god, that animation was amazing!” summarizes so much of recent anime film criticism on the internet , and no thought is given to any criticism of the animation itself. i am here to tell you that the animation here sucks! the high budget CG depicts basketball with dull realism. it’s technically impressive; the animators’ use of motion actors allows for some impressive movement. the film opens with a beautiful shot from far off in the distance of the protagonist and his brother engaged in 1:1 play, and the movement looks unbelievably good from far off that my hopes were instantly through the roof. i couldn’t wait to see the basketball. but soon i realized this film lacked all that makes anime action good. realism can only take you so far, exaggeration is necessary to sell movement. nothing had weight. the visual style lacked the dynamic nature typical of a good sports anime (which maybe i am not so qualified to speak on, having only seen ping pong, this, and some of haikyuu, but the same concepts apply to action and fight sequences in other genres). my final complaint is the faces, which convey so much less emotion than they ought to. this is the fault of CG. the eyes in particular: although the pupils move in impressive ways, the eyes barely widen and narrow, and rarely do they work together with the mouth to truly match the fierce emotional performances of the voice actors. i’m sure this would be easier with drawn faces. i wish they spent less budget on the CG jerseys and shorts (which move with expensive-looking realism that i honestly barely noticed), and spent it on emotion.the basketball sequences begin to carry more emotional weight (no thanks to the animation, all thanks to the story) as the story progresses, and i really did care for a handful of characters by the end. the flashbacks are, for the most part, effective. unfortunately, the film is too long, and at the end i found myself wishing it were 30 or even 45 minutes shorter.",4,the-first-slam-dunk

Aleksey Kravchenko's hair turned grey because of the horrible circumstances The film is like everyone says: ""grotesque, beyond harrowing, sheer terror"", but let me ask you something...is it moral to portray war through an entertainment form? Some may argue that Come and See is not for entertainment purposes, but it's dramatisation after all...it shows us characters suffering in all ways to keep us stuck to the screens, that's what entertaining is - providing content to keep us interested. I think this is a huge problem with war dramatisations in general, portraying these graphic, gory, gruesome acts in a form to basically entertain us.I can definitely see why people would say this film is awesome though. The ending is great and i can see why people would say it's impactful with the utilitarian question, camerawork is stunning, etc. my critique is just that it's exploitative and the conditions of this films shooting are too awful like i mentioned in the 3 points at the beginning of this review.

88416,"I’m glad this was able to match and at times surpass the first one’s formal stamina and punchy writing, and I think general audiences were due a good cocktease. As overstimulating as it is, there’s surprising room to breathe which I appreciated, but I think this major strength is related to the film’s ultimate weakness. It’s the same thing people criticized about EEAAO and Multiverse of Madness, that the maximalist veneer of a multiverse actually covers up the shallow and marginal differences across each universe. ATSV’s writers were smart enough to make that critique the literal plot here, but the movie constantly teeming with ideas results in a sense of perpetual first act (in contrast to EEAAO being stuck in perpetual climax, which I hope doesn’t end up being the case with BTSV*), for better or for worse.It makes sense that people are so peeved about the ending, but I actually kind of respect that a movie using maximalist language to provide a meta-commentary is willing to so earnestly double down on its Empire moment, as if to give the canon event treatment to the very framework of “second movie in a trilogy.” It doesn’t totally work because Empire and every subsequent perpetrator of this is a closed-off chapter, whereas this pays off the George Stacy arc and basically nothing else and has a ticking clock that means we kind of have to pick up immediately into the next scene. But I think at this point in movies about intertextuality we’re a little bit past self-containment, and even if the next movie doesn’t stick the landing this one is a throughly engaging experience.I hope these movies are what float to the top when we look back on the current superhero landscape, but more importantly I hope they’re also the be-all end-all of multiverse movies (*and, related, maximalist movie titles that can only be communicated in acronyms, especially in the context of Spider-Man trilogies that insist on largely keeping the same wording.

I'll watch it as my next entry in the marathon. I'm seeing Gone with the Wind tomorrow night, which is a Monday so maybe my previous statement isn't true. But I had the thought while watching this that maybe Gone with the Wind is taking it's main inspiration from this novel. Guess I'll see.I only became aware of the director King Vidor about a month ago when I watched H. M. Pullham, Esq., which I wasn't a fan of. This adaptation of War and Peace is also something of a slog. I think the first 1hr 45 mins to 2hrs is really good, then the last chunk is actually pretty boring but maybe that's simply because I don't love war films.You can tell in spots that this is really the spark notes version of Tolstoy's novel. Some cuts and time skips don't totally work. There is clunky pacing and sometimes-there-sometimes-not-narration to help fill in the gaps. Occasionally exposition is shoehorned in through dialogue when you'd really rather have just seen it play out in action.

I guess the closest I have to those achievements as of late is reading Emma, but that's only 500 pages compared to these +1000 page epics. So perhaps for the moment my watching this adaptation is my way of keeping up with the Joneses of my family.Oh, and because I'll probably never watch this again in my life (though I still very much plan to see the Sergey Bondarchuk 6.5 hour adaptation), let me say that EVERYONE in this movie is way too attractive and they're all wearing tights and beautiful jackets and starring you directly in the eyes and I would have fallen for any of them in a heartbeat.

87105,"1) Is it too late for the Academy to get Koji Yakusho a best actor nomination?2)  For about thirty years, give or take, when it comes to cinema, I've associated House of the Rising Sun with Martin Scorsese - it's belonged to Casino, and the mafia's messy fall in Las Vegas, culminating with Sharon Stone's Ginger dragging herself down a poorly lit hallway with no exit, doomed to oblivion. Which is a roundabout way of saying Wim Wenders stole the song. It belongs to this movie, now. (And the film in general uses music terrifically well. See #1 and Nina Simone)3) ""Halley's Comet appeared in 1910 (And I was born in the following year): Its period being seventy-six years and seven days, It is due to reappear in 1986.

An understanding mind one meets as seldom, and an undistracted love one wins as rarely. I know that my true friend will appear after my death, And my sweetheart died before I was born."" -Katsumi Tanaka4) At about the midway point, I started thinking about the process of making this film and what it must have entailed, and was heavily tempted to see Solveig Dommartin's absence looming over it, as surely and strongly as her presence was central to Wings of Desire and Until the End of the World. That's a reduction of course, as comparing the film to Paterson would be, and it's projecting on the nature of Hirayama's solitude as much as the Patricia Highsmith story that gets namedropped does, but it is tempting. 5) It may be a cheat, but given how central silence is to this film, it doesn't feel like a cheat to say I don't really think I need to write more. I'd say those who know, know and those who don't might, but thinking of that scene with the shadow tag, late in the film, and the fact that sooner or later, we don't know, which is part of the point, if there is a point, and it's okay.

18242,"Not only is this a film about racial tension but it’s also a clear critique of the black community (****this sentiment has recently been altered after learning more about Spike Lee. Notes at the Bottom****). I’ll give some quotes and some explanations.—“Buggin out what good is that gonna do? You know if you really try hard Buggin out, you could direct your energies in a more useful way, you know?—“Jade you gotta be down, what, you aint down?”—“Yeah buggin out im down, but im down for something positive in the community. Are you down for that?—“Jade…*sighs*, Jade I still love you anyways”The premise of the film is a guy named Buggin Out decides to take issue with an Italian American business owner having famous Italian people photographed on his wall. He feels Sal (the owner) should also have famous black people on the wall as Sal sells primarily to a black consumer base. This creates tension throughout as Buggin Out ramps up his bullshit in order to prove this point. Sal has two sons, one of which adds fuel to the fire because he is a racist hothead. The above quote is a conversation between a lady Buggin Out knows named Jade who is a strong independent black woman and Buggin Out who’s goal is to fuel tension and violence. She states they should be doing positive for the community rather than boycotting a small business owner for who he chooses to put on his wall. Buggin Out, being the idiot he is does not agree as he feels he has been insulted by Sal…somehow.—“Lookit those korean motherfuckas across the street. I bet you they havent been off the boat a year before they opened up their own place. A  motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and they already got a business in out neighborhood, a good business. Occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember. And ive been here a looong time. And now for the life of me, you know i cant figure this out, either them korean motherfuckers are geniuses or you black asses are just plain dumb.”—“Its got to be because we are black, aint no other explanation. Aint they always tryna keep the the black man to be about shit.—“You motherfuckers hold that shit down. Im tired of hearing that excuse. Im tired of hearing that shit”—“You know I will be one happy fool when we open our own business right here in our neighborhood. I swear to god I will be the first in line to spend what little money i got.”—“You motherfuckers are always talking that old Keith Sweat shit, ‘im gonna, im gonna do this, im gonna do that’ you aint gonna do a goddamn thing but sit your monkey ass on this corner.”This one is pretty self explanatory. Three black guys are sitting on a corner talking racist about how the Koreans came to America and put a business in an empty building, making a positive change for the community, while they actively do the opposite talking about how when they’re one day free from persecution they will open up a black business themselves thus creating the changes they so seek. —“All he wanted was pictures on the wall and he died.”This is in reference to a character who comes in with 6 or so other people creating an absolute scene in Sal’s business. When confronted the two sides scream racist things at each other before a fight breaks out and the police are called. The police then kill one of the boys. Then instead of fighting the police, the neighborhood immediately blames the Italian American business owner and his sons and burn his building down. Then one of the black main characters (Mookie) says this quote lacking clear understanding of who is at fault and why the escalation occurred.—“What the fuck is wrong with you. I couldnt give a fuck about the money. You see this fucking place. I built this fuckin place. With my bare fuckin hands! Every light socket, every piece of tile. Me with these fucking hands. You know what the fuck that means?” —“Yeah it means pay me my motherfucking money.  Thats what it means sal.”In the end Sal is standing outside his burned down business when Mookie walks up expecting to be paid. Mind you this is after he threw a garbage can through Sal’s window and helped burn down his business. Mookie lacks any remorse and again, understanding as to why what he is asking for is so fuckin ridiculous. He expects because he is black and because he is angry any part he had in inciting complete chaos be forgiven and even rewarded. Now im sure this was Spike Lees intention with this film. The man clearly wants to elevate his community. The quote at the very end also helps reinforce that. And while no side is not at fault, it is clear who the main antagonist was in this film—the police, “The Man”. However, as Spike Lee points out we do not affect them. We instead burn down businesses owned by the other side who in turn return the favor, always keeping two races or more constantly at war. The reasons are not always justified but when it comes to hate, they don’t need to be. You just have to be mad and be willing to hurt others. And when you’re hurt back you have to be willing to cry about it, to demand justice, but not for what you’ve done but for what you think has been done against you.There are so many more examples of these quotes and situations in this movie. It’s sad to watch, and as an intelligent person at times it’s completely idiotic. I scratch my head wondering why, if what we seek is peace why are some so hell bent on violence and hate to get it. I think what helps prove the lunacy behind this is that this was made in 1989. Here we are almost 35 years later and it’s still happening. One of the dumbest movies I’ve seen for all these reasons but also one of the best. I’ll stick with a 7 for now.*It is possible I am completely wrong and Spike Lee sees these characters not as the fools they are, but as honorable human beings. And if thats the case this would get a much lower score. But from what I could gather on this first viewing that’s not his intention. So hopefully I’m right. I think most of these quotes are pretty telling and that’s only a small percentage of what’s in the film.**After reading some stuff and watching an interview with Spike Lee I can see I am wrong. Spike Lee is clearly more simple than I thought and there is no nuance to the film or hidden theme. Everything here is worn on its sleeve. Horrible characters are given sympathy and evidently their actions are byproducts of some age old curse and not to be held accountable for. Dropping a half star for these reasons but gonna keep it at a 3 as the technical aspect of the film is great.",5,do-the-right-thing

16174,"After a year of finding out how to watch Memories of Murder, I finally found a cheap way to watch it! And after watching 4 films from Bong Joon-ho I now have another film I have to scratch off my watchlist. But with that being said, let’s talk about this film.Memories of Murder is based on true events about the first series of murders in South Korea, and it focuses on the lives of these 2 police officers as they try to catch the person responsible for these horrific crimes.I will admit, before Parasite I have never heard of Bong Joon-ho or seen any of his films. But after I watched Parasite, Snowpiercer, and The Host, I started getting in the mood of trying to find more of them. This film caught most of my attention because it was based on true crime, and it was also favored a lot more than Bong’s other films. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find Memories of Murder because it was a very hard film to find. I looked on eBay and they were very expensive because they were out of print, so I was sure they I was never going to see it. But then, a miracle happened. I found it on Amazon Prime for only $6 to rent, and I said, “It’s not my account, but what the hell. I’ll pay my mother in law back for renting a movie on her account.” After watching it, I thought it was very good! I thought it was very well constructed and it was incredible that rarely films these days that are based on true events are put together and manage to keep the viewers on track. So thank you, Mr. Joon-ho for making perfectly good films!The acting from the cast was terrific! Song Kang-ho, who’s been a collaborator for Joon-ho, is a damn good actor! I’m starting to recognize him more and more after seeing almost every South Korean film, (I have The Age of Shadows on my watchlist, and I’ll do a review on it soon) and I think he’s one of the best actors from South Korea. But anyways, his character is Park Du-Man. He is a detective who’s been out of his depth. He’s been in the force for so many years he thinks that the scientific approach of systematic investigation is nonsense and trusts his eyes more on looking at criminals. Apparently, he’s a guy who trusts his gut more than what the lack of evidence shows. Helping him and his police force is another detective named Seo Tae-Yun, played by Kim Sang-Kyung. volunteered to be on this case and came from Seoul. While Park relies on being bold and swagger, Seo is the opposite by being rational. When you see these 2 actors on screen together, you can feel the chemistry and the depth they’ve put themselves into their characters. I’m not going to spoil anything for those who haven’t seen it, but you can feel the helplessness and frustration in these 2 men when it comes to that final scene they share together. And it feels melancholic in a sense.Bong Joon-ho knows how to make perfection! For a South Korean filmmaker, he sticks to being original in his own craft of storytelling and filmmaking. Out of the films I’ve seen from international directors, Joon-ho has got me watching more of his work. More than Kurosawa, Cuarón, Iñárritu, and Fellini. While it’s clear that Memories of Murder is influenced by Se7en, Zodiac, and Insomnia, Joon-ho had his film carefully and delicately put together by not copying trademarks or other similarities from films or their directors. So he pulls it off with having a haunting cinematography from Kim Hyung-koo, beautiful music from Tarō Iwashiro, and amazing direction from Bong Joon-ho himself!Before I end this, I have one question. When are we going to get this on the Criterion Collection? I know I’ve heard it said it was going to get a Criterion release, including Parasite. And I don’t see what’s the hold up after it has been almost an entire year. I want it from the Criterion so I can have it in my collection, but God only knows when the release will be announced. Anyways, Memories of Murder is a really good film from Bong Joon-ho and a really good true crime film! If you haven’t seen it, I suggest finding it and renting it on Vudu or Amazon Prime. It’s such a great film, check it out!I’m giving Memories of Murder 4.5 stars!",8,memories-of-murder

83648,"Considered by many to be the most under-appreciated film of Andrei Tarkovsky's career, Nostalgia intertwines faith, art, culture, philosophy & spirituality through the wistful eyes of a Russian writer who visits Italy for research purposes but finds himself lost & longing for his homeland until he meets a strange local who shares his feeling of alienation.Co-written & directed by Tarkovsky (Solaris & Stalker), the story employs dreams & memories to explore themes of nostalgia & homesickness and incorporates slices of the director's own voyage to Italy. Cinematography is a definite highlight, for the use of silent manoeuvres, steady zooms, sharp imagery, long takes & ideal lighting is as inspiring as it is breathtaking.But this isn't a film for all. The narrative is esoteric, pacing is lethargic, characters are distant, and it doesn't take long for the patience to run out. Nothing happens in it. From start to finish, its characters are lost in their own worlds and remain as alien to the viewers as they are to their surroundings. And the glacial pace at which it all unfolds only makes the journey all the more frustrating.Overall, Nostalgia turned out to be an excruciatingly slow & downright tedious experience for me, and sitting through it was no less than a chore. The film isn't going to appease every palate nor is it meant to do that but for those who find themselves intrigued by its premise and are invested in the proceedings and can patiently connect with it, Tarkovsky's penultimate feature might just deliver the desired goods.",3,nostalgia-1983
35739,"Starting to believe Ozu is just not the director for me. That's okay as he has a legion of fans and supporters but so far, as with most Japanese cinema, I just find myself unphased and unconvinced of what I'm seeing on screen. The compositions are beautiful, the music was touching, the screenplay itself was actually quite interesting at times but the narrative was more frustrating due to dated traditions and values that I find myself just unable to comprehend or relate to. And yes I know it's tragic in the sense that this stuff happened but it's just awfully contrived drama for situations that could have been fully just avoided lol.I found the text to be repetitive and often treading the same perspectives on the conversations and subject matter of marriages, free will, traditions and modernity, and obligations to the family.I do appreciate how Ozu forces you to engage with the text and fill in the gaps of information for yourself. It's never over-expository.The moralities are interesting to ponder on and it serves as a window into the tragic reality of societal, traditional and familial expectations of Post-War Japan.I'm so interested in these family dynamics because they seem so alien and antiquated to me. So far removed from my own family and the families I've seen growing up lol.Along with my inability to really care about anything I really see on screen, It's really the acting and execution that just remains so unappealing to me. Don't even get me started on ole' smiley face.Does every Ozu film have shots where the actors are looking directly at me and saying their lines?Not even trying to be rude but it kind of just ruins my immersion, takes me out of the movie, reminds me I'm watching a film, and even slightly makes me uncomfortable.

74527,"65/100Not logging this as a rewatch because I'd previously only seen it on network TV, interrupted by commercials and presumably edited for content and/or time. That was over 30 years ago, and The Elephant Man might have been my first Lynch experience (otherwise it's, um, Dune); odds are I perceived it then as standard prestige Oscarbait, à la Mask a bit later. No surprise now to find that Lynch and Alan Splet pretty much replicate Eraserhead's industrial soundscape, or that the film concludes with a disembodied head floating in space. Indeed, for a while I was concerned that it's too Lynchian—that this director's penchant for photographing unusual bodies (Michael J. Anderson, Carel Struycken, Richard Pryor toward the end of his life), rendering them uncanny, can't help but undermine any effort to explore Merrick's humanity. This feeling was exacerbated by Lynch's decision to keep Merrick largely unseen for the first half hour or so, as if he were the shark in Jaws or the E.T. in E.T. Even though I remembered that he's plainly seen at length later on, this approach still struck me as misguided showmanship, designed to whet the viewer's appetite for sensation.I was wrong. Or, rather, it took me a ridiculously long time to recognize that Lynch employs this strategy in order to subvert it—that Merrick's gentle soul makes a greater impact if he's initially treated as monstrous not merely by the public but by the film itself. At the same time, Lynch truly is drawn to deformity, in a way that's at once exploitative and reverential. The Elephant Man thus serves as the rare hybrid of horror and weepie in which both genres prove equally potent. However, Lynch's sensibility leaves him feeling clueless about what to do with Treves, whose mix of compassion and ambition should really be central here. ""Am I a good man or am I a bad man?"" Treves asks at one point, but the movie ultimately seems uninterested in the answer; the idea that Merrick has merely become a classier sideshow attraction, catering to a much wealthier clientele, gets brief lip service but no real exploration. Instead, the leering riffraff make a climactic reappearance, thereby letting both high society and the Pathological Society off the hook. (To be fair, it does also facilitate some stunning shots that suggest The Night of the Hunter starring the cast of Freaks.) By the end—and isn't this ironic?— I was reminded of those social-media threads that show an abandoned or feral animal (cat or dog, usually) before and after it's been adopted by a loving family. They always make me cry (and I teared up here at the conclusion of the Romeo and Juliet reading), but they're superficially rather than deeply moving. This film could have been much spikier, but it shies away.Oh yeah: I should probably say something about Hurt's performance, since he was Oscar-nominated and all. Obviously the makeup does a whole lot of work here, as does Merrick's inherent piteousness; had Lynch been able to cast Jack Nance, as he'd wanted to do, it's quite likely that Nance's name would've been called at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. But Hurt's voice was always one of his greatest tools, and there's something heartbreakingly metatextual (for those who know how mellifluous he usually sounds) about hearing it distorted like this. Adds yet another layer to the sense of beauty being rendered almost unrecognizable, accessible only to those willing to put in the effort.",6,the-elephant-man

Personally, I'm not that fond of Shakespeare, let alone his tragedies, maybe with an exception for Macbeth. Ran is a wonderful spectacle but also a test of endurance. It's also all very exaggerated, the acting, the red paint being thrown against the walls, that I didn't sympathize at all with the story after a while, too bombastic and theatrical for my liking and mainly too long.

11481,"Dune rant coming from an Arab: This is an orientalist, racist disaster that did not sit right with me. This appropriative bs wouldn't exist without MENA culture and Islamic influence while not casting a single MENA actor or giving credit. Like full on Arabic words were used…It was literally filmed in UAE and Jordan and Villeneuve didn’t think to include a single MENA person.Orientalism is when we view eastern cultures through a Western lens, simplifying and stereotyping them into exoticized versions. Now you can see the issue with using stolen elements of Islamic and MENA culture because it reduces them to superficial and exotic aesthetics. The desert visuals and foreign sounding score everyone is obsessing over is just romanticized orientalism. While Muslim women are hate crimed every day for veiling, Anna Taylor Joy wears a veil to the dune red carpet event and gets praised for her “mysterious” look. And while this appropriation of Arab and Muslim culture is there in the original book, Villeneuve's adaptation simplifies the actual authentic elements of culture so much to the point where it reduces it to nothing but exotic aesthetics. Ex: changing the Arabic word Jihad and using Holy war. I’m honestly so sick of indigenous people being constantly dehumanized and portrayed as mysterious exotic nomads who live in the desert. Yay a white man enters the land of indigenous people and leads the desert barbarians! And the worst part is all the hype this movie is getting during a genocide where Palestine, an ACTUAL Arab country is being destroyed by the west. The dehumanization of Arabs reinforced by media like this is part of the issue. This is why colonial ideologies still exist.

17381,"Inarguably the finest chapter of George Lucas' epic space opera, The Empire Strikes Back takes Star Wars saga to a whole new level of science-fiction possibilities with its much darker tone & greater emphasis on character development & storytelling. Yet, thanks to its badly dated visual outlook & my absence of any nostalgic attachment, this one was difficult to take seriously just like its predecessor.As for the plot summary... After the destruction of the Death Star in the last chapter, the Empire makes a brutal comeback against the Rebellion & succeeds in overthrowing the Rebel forces from their hidden base. The story of Luke Skywalker continues as he undergoes advanced Jedi training under the supervision of Master Yoda. And the evil lord Darth Vader becomes obsessed with finding Luke & pursues his friends in order to capture him.Brilliantly directed by Irvin Kirshner, The Empire Strikes Back has a much darker mood compared to the adventurous flavour of the original, the entire cast chips in with even more mature performances, the special effects are somewhat improved & John Williams' soundtrack outstandingly builds upon the already sensational score of the previous film to further amplify its cinematic experience.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back continues to explore the boundaries of creativity & imagination in cinema and is a successful follow up to A New Hope which in the end with its clever, twisting & unforgettable climax redefined not only its genre but cinema itself. One of the most influential films of all time. Greatest as well? Not for me.",6,the-empire-strikes-back
33838,"""We don't even known if we're going forwards or back. Then we get lost.""- VoulaI sit here, quietly reflecting on what is simply a breathtakingly artistic piece of film.  It's slow in pace, but packs one hell of an emotional punch.There is very little dialogue in this classic from '88.  Every single word is carefully chosen and serves a purpose.  Likewise, the story meanders deliberately to it's wonderfully rich conclusion, but never feels like it has lost it's way.  The story is always going somewhere.Theo Angelopoulos directs this movie impeccably.  There are moments where you forget this is a film and not a real life observation of two kids growing up, growing cynical, growing more worldly.  I can't wait to see Eternity and a Day next.Now, back to the present time, and a more pressing question.  Why the hell are my stoopid eyes leaking?

25650,"☆""I know what I must do. It's just… I'm afraid to do it.""☆Afraid no longer, I will tackle this trilogy if it kills me. And if it loses me followers.The wizards and warriors genre is my kryptonite, just the most awful style of films that will never ever be appealing to me and only causes harm whenever I get near it. There's a reason why my favorite (not the best) movie makes fun of fucking dragons and fantasy horseshit, because this stuff is just ripe for parody. Absolutely nothing about this exhausting three-hour snoozefest appeals to me in any way, save for the admittedly world-class groundbreaking production design and special effects. (No, I am not going to summarize the plot. All you nerds know it already.)I didn't grow up reading anything from J.R.R. Tolkien, as I've disliked this kind of content for as long as I can remember. Growing older and proudly renouncing my Catholicism made it even easier to distance myself from Tolkien and other devout Christians and their apologist nonsense, so there was and remains zero chance I would ever ever read any of his literature. That said, I've begun running out of excuses not to see nearly universally acclaimed films, despite my antipathy to certain genres and plots. I am the type of person just giggling with derision at the ludicrous ""YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"" line even though it's meant to be said in strong defiance. No, Gandalf, you're just a sweaty old man who needs a haircut. I'm glad you fell.I first tried to watch this when I was 19 or 20, as I had a nerdy friend in college who was all about this elf and dwarf shit. So I was in his dormroom and couldn't make it through the first half-hour or so. Just, nope. At that point I wasn't a film guy at all. I was probably too busy playing Unreal Tournament online or something, or listening to Slipknot. Okay, I deserved that laugh. Go ahead.But so do dozens of lines in this film. ""Forged by Sauron! Within the fires of Mount Dooooom!"" Oooh so dark. Then occasionally the worst comic relief, failing one after the other to make me laugh on cue. As it was, the funniest parts are probably things I'm not supposed to think are funny. The romantic angle is forced and boring. Brutally flat exposition, overly complicated then shifting to laughably obvious repetition. Is this a children's movie? Did we need the same thing or same trait repeated over and over and over again? This is three goddamn hours! And yet there are so many unresolved facets, stories that expect you to read entire books to understand, and silly silly names. How many times do we need to hear ""[stupid name], son of [stupid name]"" in this film?The whole story feels like a gigantic introduction to characters you can't possibly remember unless you know them all already. How is this a good movie if it requires you to have all the information ahead of time?I've never been a fan of films using ""fate"" or ""forces beyond our control"" as a central tenet. It smacks of the lunacy of religion and mythology and the loss of rationality and reason to drive life and decisions. And The Lord of the Rings is full of this stuff. Now I'm just piling on. What did I like about this? It's real purty. But, like, any idiot with a helicopter can take some beautiful shots of New Zealand, so that isn't very impressive really. Though many of the effects and motion capture -- and Peter Jackson's use of practical makeup and effects -- are fantastic, with some impressive world-building and action. Every once in a while there's a shot that looks grainy or rough. Look hard enough and you'll see a couple moments that look all of 20 years old. (Whatever monster that was in the cave water looked like a cartoon.) The Marvel films have drastically improved on green screen technology, but at least I did like when this movie tried not to rely on it too much. When the boring story fades away a bit and you have cool fight scenes, alright now, I can dig that. Otherwise? A big yawn from me. A story I don't know, a genre I don't like, a cast of characters I don't care about, and a brutally long runtime that's at least an hour too long.I can't believe I'm going to ruin two more evenings this week to watch the next ones.

71938,"YIKES—A word said during this film by myself exactly 33 timesAs I have said before, I'm turning into a Hitchcock Hoe and this was SO good. I can't even begin to describe what I felt watching this. The cinematography alone was phenomenal. The narrative surrounding Madeleine (Kim Novak) was so fascinating to me because I'm obsessed with stories with people becoming possessed by unknown forces. So when it was suggested that she was being possessed by a deceased ancestor i was like damn Ghost Adventures is no joke!!!But then shit got really YIKES and Madeleine did THAT and Joanne the Scammer was found dead in Miami.Speaking of death, you know who I wanted dead? Jimmy Stew—Wait...It's possible to wish death upon Jim Jams?!? Hitch, my dude, what have you done?!? My world has been turned upside down and I haven't stopped screaming over the ending.",8,vertigo

That’s key, I’m sure, as to why I am utterly confused about the general consensus on this.Now that we got that out of the way, this shit was laughably horrible. There was one other person in the theater with me and we were both cracking up the entire time at what a joke this was.All of the basketball is so bad and makes no sense.  The main character is a terrible basketball player. He can’t score or shoot and had the worst assist to turnover ratio in basketball history, but he never gets pulled because he’s fast and has heart?Just a confusing, poorly written, and really bad basketball movie. And the animation wasn’t bad but also just looked like video game graphics. Sorry my anime brothers and sisters 🤷🏽‍♂️",2,the-first-slam-dunk
88099,"Film Club! Film Club RankedI felt like this was a tough one to review. I liked the overall plot, and really enjoyed the nature of how a toxic relationship effects both parties involved. But there was something off to me. The directing style I’m sure works for some people, but for more, I didn’t really like it. Too many shots the lingered for too long, or became sudden close ups, to me just felt rather odd. I liked the two main characters enough, and it’s upsetting to see just how reliant they are on eachother despite most of their days being fuelled by anger and darker issues, rather than the happiness and love they both clearly want. It’s obvious they aren’t right for eachother, but at the same time you totally understand just why they are together, they have no one else. Lost in a foreign land, they come back together over and over, and the toxic cycle restarts itself. Both actors are great at showing their fragile nature, and the reliance they both have on the other person. The film feels quite slow at times, with the odd directing kind of taking me out of the moment a few times. But thankfully the plot and characters managed to pull me back in each time. Everything feels so dark, gritty and grimy. Even in their moments of happiness there is a stark contrast to what is shown around them, something I feel could have been played with more. Perhaps more colour and brightness in their happiest moments rather than the bleakness shown throughout. The movie feels rather bleak throughout, the completely toxic relationship seeming like it’s needed for these characters to keep going, cycling and circling back around to each other despite their differences and faults. It’s certainly an interesting idea, but for me, didn’t completely pay off and left me feeling rather cold, which was probably intended.⏮ Last Time Frozen 2 ⏭ Next Time The Irishman",3,happy-together-1997
